Poker isn't luck. You can win without looking at your cards.

Poker is a game of skill with an element of chance. When you get one outed what is that but bad luck? It can also go the other way sometimes, it's just variance.

Why do places no longer have toilets? (Petrol stations, supermarkets, McDonald's, shopping centres etc)
Train stations and pubs still have them, but no where else does
<comment>
big fat seaside moonface
<comment>
They do, you LARP as an outside goer.
<comment>
The only fat people I have respect for are strongmen and powerlifters. All the rest need to go on a diet or fuck off and die
<comment>
moonfaceMARK
<comment>
Every supermarket, shopping centre and Maccie's I've been to have toilets
<comment>
They physically still have them, but they are universally locked with 'out of service' on them. All 4 supermarkets in my town have been closed for 2 months now, even the petrol stations have it too
<comment>
The toast TikTok is not new, a true Seaside Soldier should have known this from the start.
<comment>
You probably live in a dodgy area and too many homeless people or junkies were using the bathrooms so they keep them locked

It's a fact proven by multiple studies that police officers are more likely to have psychopathic traits than most other professions. The job itself attracts people looking to abuse their power with total impunity.

<comment>
Auditposting isn't going to make Ruth love you, and it's transparent to anyone that you only like the videos because the confrontations get you excited and you'll never do it yourself.
<comment>
RIP in peace Jerry Springer. Just read the news. He was good in Austin Powers and the Simpsons.
<comment>
Only sad people do this.
Didn't one of your audit spackers have a breakdown in a pub and get arrested the other day? They're all deeply miserable people mate.
<comment>
Looks like someone sliced his jacket. No doubt was some angry dickhead.
<comment>
Yep that's my life. Knowing that changing it will only bring a marginal improvement doesn't really make me want to bother. I'll still be khhv and never have my own place.
<comment>
Nobody will love me you fucking dickhead. How many times do I have to say this? Women...even old women have some ridiculous high bar for a partner. It doesn't matter what I do. I'm unattractive and can't earn the big bucks.

<comment>
I don't give a shit about his fake youtuber apology video, he was screeching about tyrants as he was getting arrested. They're all the same, just miserable cunts too ugly to be successful youtube grifters like Jake Paul or whatever so they spend their time trying to bully random people. If they gave a shit about your rights they would focus on something that was actually important and under threat, the filming in public thing just allows them to farm easy content for spiteful cripples like you.
<comment>
Stood next to a chubby woman on the train today who was about an inch smaller than me and I got a chub. There's not enough tall women.
<comment>
And how is it even possible to be lovable when there's so many attractive single lads out there? I couldn't even reach such levels.
<comment>
When I was 15 I proper fancied Jenna Coleman, still fucking fit as fuuuuck lads. What about yous?

ab and dj have a lot of subscribers and make good money from it. They don't all do it for money and fame.
<comment>
Having passions, hobbies, interests, aspirations, thoughts that aren't based on spite and jealousy? Won't get me a gf
<comment>
I don't know, in your case. You seem fundamentally incapable of enjoying life, just not for the reasons you think.
<comment>
I've slowly realised I'm a very spiteful and jealous person by nature
Just a genuinely bad person, honestly
Can't change it
<comment>
Still it comes down to money with women. If you can't afford to take them out every weekend, you're not really desirable to them. It might be different if you grew up with them but as an adult, the bar is higher. Plus not having a car and your own place makes things even worse. It's not just about hobbies.
<comment>
Ruthmong realising in his 30s that money can be exchanged for goods and services
<comment>
Corrr ruthmong's having the meltdown today. You have dug your own grave and now you must slowly wank yourself to death in.it.
<comment>
The reasons are there. It's knowing I could only do things by myself. The fact is unless you already have lots of friends and connections your chances of finding love are very slim. A lot of women in the workplace will be taken.
<comment>
Some of my earliest wanks were over Stacey off Eastenders, I look at pics of her now and she does absolutely nowt for me
<comment>
Even if I was 21 again, I'd still be unattractive and undesirable.
<comment>
Because you were only attracted to teenagers you nonce.
<comment>
I remember having a thing for Rachel Stevens and Kylie Minogue. Used to watch a lot of music channels
<comment>
That's really not a nice thing to say about her. She's so sweet.
<comment>
If I didnt live in this miserable shithole i wouldve had friends and a gf by now
<comment>
I'm breaking down slowly and I know the future is only going to be more negative events in my life. I don't think anything positive has come from adult life. I'm not in a good state to work.
<comment>
I don't really want to work anyway. Working and not having all the perks like relationships just makes me feel more depressed. Being homeless sounds more appealing. At least then I can just walk around.
<comment>
Whats your diet like mate?
<comment>
What sucks is having to hear the parents moan about their health all day. It's all about them. I wish I could have moved out long ago with a gf.
<comment>
the reason why sean couldnt get an erection when he was with paige is because he is secretly gay

He isn't content to be miserable, he has to spend the majority of his time trying to convince everyone else to be miserable as well because it's all so hopeless isn't it? It's dire stuff.

Also never taking a single morsel of blame. Guarantee one of these days he'll try to go postal but probably get tackled by a deano before he harms anyone and then we'll mock him relentlessly.

Oh for fuck sake lads, not too sure what's happened but I've somehow managed to piss off the Mrs. Got into a debate about the difference in cruelty between regular cows farmed for maccies burgers and foie gras. I said it isn't really that different but arguably foie gras is worse but somehow she still got pissed off at me pointing out the grey areas. What did I do wrong here exactly?
<comment>
Anyone else watching Selby Vs Allen.
It's been a great little battle so far.

Her parents must've put up with so much drama growing up. She was a self-harmer as evident from analysing her arms. This is why she is careful to not show them fully or wears long sleeves in videos. Very traumatic past she had.

Unlawfully arrested and tortured in custody. They tried to fabricate the story to the CPS to justify his arrest. Section 50 is abused so much to obtain your personal details. Fucking corrupt to the core.

<comment>
The old pinch and twist feels so good.
<comment>
You have advanced techniques
<comment>
Section 50 can only be used if you've been suspected of a crime. That's the only case they can request your personal details or face threat of arrest. He hasn't been suspected of any crime. That's a clear abuse of powers if they arrested under Section 50 without suspicion of a crime. PIGS.

I wouldn't call it a toxic relationship but I can imagine she gets a bit irritable at times. Poor lad has to avoid stepping on the eggshells when it's one of those days for her. 
"don't speak to me" *puts hand in face* and walks off kind of girl I reckon.
<comment>
And yeah I know her game. She's told another asmr girl about me, probably made out I'm crazy. I'm sure she takes great pleasure making men like me suffer emotionally.
<comment>
With all due respect get a life
<comment>
Never ever mess with an emotional unstable man. Never walk alone in the evening.
<comment>
I can't just get a life. The things I want are unobtainable. I can't get love. I am incel.
<comment>
You overvalue relationships women are trash find something else to make you happy
<comment>
To get a life would mean I can have some normality, be desired and not be treated like literal shit on someone's shoe. It's too fucking late to catch up. I have no experience of love. Now all I can do is turn to hate.
<comment>
That's like dangling some delicious dessert in my face and saying it's trash. If I haven't had it, I need to try it...just like most others. I will never get over this feel. Every year it tears me down just a little bit more. It's dark times ahead.
<comment>
Or you could stop caring so much and have fun
<comment>
I can't. It's such a natural feel that I'll never experience.

He out there doing hard graft today he's a fucking hard grafter. He's out there for woork he's ready for work de lads it's better than sitting in sad, lonely, bored and depressed. He works mate. He does voluntary work. He has to get train to Poole he does. He hard working, he hard grafting and he working all the way till about five. Luckily he has a bit of free time tomorrow. He doing such hard graft. He a model worker and he a hard worker. He does voluntary work doesn't he? He does some hard graft he gets more experience and what an experiment. He's put there bettering his life. He grafting hard. He twenty seven week no bookies he going to graft HARD today because he's a hard grafter.

it's gibberish unless you did A level maths
most annoying part is that he's made 'a' the starting point of the particle, when 'a' normally refers to some vector field denoting du/dt (acceleration)
<comment>
He eats like a horse from a trough, absolute simpleton. 
Mathematics modules were my least favourite when I studied CompSci but I did see the value in learning stuff like linear algebra, makes sense for algorithms and data science.
Voluntary work
not voluntary if they threaten to cut his benefits if he doesn't go.
Since he stopped having breakdowns and getting shitfaced dancing in the streets no one gives a fuck about this clown anymore. He spends his pittance doing normie shit like take Helen out for dinner.

Not to mention the cheap ones for a quid.
<comment>
I do my research 
have you bought a house yet
not heard anything from anyone in a while but offer was accepted 2 weeks ago

Because not everyone is a benefits scrounger that has to penny pinch. You are lying to yourself if you think that cheap frozen shit is as nice as fresh pizza.

<comment>
Large swathes of society are being priced out of basic human necessities such as food, heating and shelter by rampant unchecked greed. Even working a full time job is no guarantee of security.
The ownership class need to read a history book and remember what happens when people go from having nothing to gain to having nothing to lose.
It's time to pull out of slavery and get on the neetbucks if we can't have our basic needs met. Add on the insane high standards of females these days too... there's not much reason to work.
<comment>
Why are you always trying to encourage us to be as miserable as you?
<comment>
You dropped these mate.
<comment>
Nah man. No supermarket pizza lives up to Domino's. The texture, the taste, the quality of the ingredients. Could eat one everyday if they weren't so pricey.
<comment>
Why would I be sour if I don't like the taste of the products these shit tier purveyors of shitness provide?
Really, they are on par with the chicagotown and goodfellas? brands. It would be better making ones own pizza.

The Dominos pizza bases are great. Frozen pizza cannot compare. I've tried most frozen pizzas and I've not had one live up to takeaway pizza. The ones made in Asda are disgusting. I don't know how anyone can enjoy them.
<comment>
Seems like you're blaming everybody but the politicians that allow it. Very strange behaviour.
<comment>
Feeling sad because I'm going to see her tonight, but I can't stay round hers. Woe is me
<comment>
The Dominos pizza bases are great.
But not the sauce and toppings? I agree. Bit too much to pay for a nice base, no?
<comment>
Yeah I'm having a wonderful life. You just have to play the game rather than moan that it's unfair. I bet there are people that think it's unfair they pay for you to rot in your mums box room but they don't go on about it like you do.

Ejaculated in a woman's vagina twice last night
<comment>
I remember the early days with my girlfriend trying to squeeze as much out of ever last minute before one of us had to go home for the night. Enjoy the intensity of it all anon.
<comment>
I have no issue with any of it. It's better than Pizza Hut.
<comment>
It's time to pull out of slavery and get on the neetbucks if we can't have our basic needs met.
If everyone did this the government would just cut you leeches off on mass and leave you to die. Natural selection is prevalent in all life on this earth, why should you be any different?
<comment>
Pizza hut is actual shit. Always overcooked and rubbery. It might just been where I live they don't know how to make a fucking pizza. Back in the mid 2000's Pizza Hut was way better than Domino's.
<comment>
the shut in dossers have spent HOURS talking about pizza
<comment>
Without minimum wage wagies society would crumble. Not everyone can gain skills. Idiot.
<comment>
Personality alone isn't enough to attract a woman. They would date neets otherwise.
<comment>
Jokes on you, I've been out to the dosscentre this morning.
<comment>
is appaently incapable of gaining skills
calling other people idiots
You're in a right nasty mood today Ruthmong. Least you're not taking it out on your poor mum.
<comment>
Play the game and never win. That's not a fair game to me. Fuck slavery. I'd rather neet it up and die young.
<comment>
Your personality is absolutely horrible
<comment>
No. We riot and bring down the government, then we go after the elite class to get our wealth back.
<comment>
Not everyone can gain skills. Idiot.
And that is why your options are work minimum wage or take the government pittance. Just embrace your lot in life.
Personality alone isn't enough to attract a woman
I have some bad news for you chief, it is likely yours is just incredibly shit. I've known many NEET's that got girls based on them being interesting or funny.
<comment>
It all gets to me you see all this doom and gloom news. Convinces me even more to not bother with life. I wish I had a fighting chance.
<comment>
Play the game and never win
Because you are shit at it. Thanks for playing.
I'd rather neet it up and die young
As I said natural selection at work. No need to be upset these are just the facts.
<comment>
It is now due to decades of never having love. Anyone else would get this way if they were in the same position.
<comment>
Never going to happen. I said play the game, you aren't actually going to win it. Luckily for the government most NEETS are so poorly adjusted they just sit and rot in their parents houses getting shitfaced to numb the pain like Makaveli.
Convinces me even more to not bother with life. 
I wish I had a fighting chance.
Stop pretending you even want one, you just want an excuse to wither or someone to blame it on to make yourself feel better.
<comment>
If I wanted to be this way, then I wouldn't be so fucking angry and depressed. I fucking hate this country. I'm not going to support it.
<comment>
Nah man, I knew a guy who was a NEET KHHV at 28, but he was a really nice dude with healthy opinions and attitudes towards women. He met a girl on VR Chat and they have a kid now. You are just a salty fuck.
<comment>
Poorfags trying to convince me not spend less than 1% of my monthly pay on a pizza. Christ alive imagine having to care that much about 20 fucking quid.
<comment>
If it makes you feel better a promise a woman won't make your situation any better, ask anyone here that was in your situation that found a girlfriend. They don't just cure your depression.
<comment>
20 quid is a lot of money when you rely on government handouts and lying about being disabled to try and milk money from the teet of public funding.
<comment>
I'd say a good 75% of the depression will go if I had a girlfriend. I'd be in a better place, contributing to society and feel valued for once. I know it's not going go fix all the issues.
<comment>
How all these people complain about housing when SSM lives a fairly decent life and never works? Did he get lucky?

He has been supplemented many times by family members behind the scenes, also it isn't hard to maintain his incredibly low standard of life on benefits. He also has to do voluntary work a few days a week to get his benefits now.
<comment>
The fact you don't see anything remotely fucking creepy about your post tells me everything about why you aren't doing very well in life. I genuinely think you are probably quite an unhinged and dangerous individual. It concerns me that you are unironically a ticking time bomb.
<comment>
I'm not dangerous. I would be the most caring person for a decent girl like her. However, if I am going to be alone then of course it's going to fuck my mental health bad.

I've said some things but I've never crossed the line. It's just a symptom of being alone. I can't help it.
<comment>

Caring people do not stalk strangers online for a start. And the fact that you refuse to take any responsibility for scaring her and ruining her hobby proves my point about how you just blame everyone else for your problems. Genuinely the whole world isn't out to get you and the sooner you realise your problems are YOUR problems the more likely it is you will have the agency to get your shit together.
<comment>

<comment>
I feel like the attention he gets on /britfeel/ is just about the only human interaction in his life, even though everyone thinks he's a bellend. Imagine how creepy you need to be to get socially ostracised here, he'd be much better off in one of the outer /r9k/ threads.
<comment>
Morning morning morning lads, Hotel lady and Shush. 
I hope you are all well and looking forward to another long weekend and maybe have some nice plans. 
I've done a quick garage tidy and will go and watch the sail boats and walk around the park for a while. Will grab some alcohol free beers later. 
Take care lads and don't let the demoralisation mongs drag you down, nothing makes them happier than the though of you being depressed and contemplation hurting yourself or others. Don't give them the satisfaction. 
One last thing:
Burger > Kebab > Pizza
<comment>
Honestly its fucking pathetic. If you're a 9-5er who's content and well adjusted, good on you lad. Equally if your a NEET and you spend your bennys on Frosty Jacks and quite merrily get shitfaced on tax payers money, good on you as well!
Whatever you do, just fucking own it rather than whinge like this creepy wanker.

She clearly had other factors going on like being busy with college. I doubt it was me and I was quite supportive of her. She's not as strong as Laurel. Laurel wouldn't let a larp get to her. I'm crossing my fingers she comes back because she's letting down 16k subscribers who support her so much.

<comment>
genuinely comfy post lad. sounds like you've had a nice morning. I'm off to Costco with the missus to grab a load of bakery shit for the long weekend, then we're gonna watch the original Star Wars trilogy and play some Divinity OS2. Agree to disagree though mate Burger > Pizza > Kebab

What's the point taking meds? Can't honestly see them making me feel like being a productive member of society. My libido will be nuked too. One of the few joys in life taken away.
<comment>
not even ruthmong can get me today lads, it's pay day, first of many long weekends here in blighty and I've got a few hundred quid to burn this month.
Post box rooms lads!

Oof that's a small box room. Smaller than mine and I'm a neet.
<comment>
mummy had to remove the boxes to get my bed in silly.

It's time for me to sleep lads. Will be watching the asmr.
<comment>
Yeah parents weren't happy when I insisted I have a desk in my room rather than a wardrobe. Ending up having my clothes in my dads wardrobe
<comment>
Ha yea, it's exactly like this. Although I've done this with many birds before, it never fails to hurt.
Usually I stay round hers Friday and Saturday night but she's got exams and wants to study and I want to get out her hair. Gonna barely see her May. Sucks
<comment>
Can't believe I set off an entire exchange on frozen pizzas not comparing to Dominos when I never even referred to frozen pizzas as the comparison, I obviously meant the fancy 5 quid ones they have in the chilled isles.
And I stand by the fact they go toe-to-toe with domitoes.
<comment>
Good on you for putting her first though lad. My missus refused to come back and see me till I handed in my dissertation since I very nearly fucked my studies up the wall at the very end in favour of being a lovesick fool
<comment>
Even so they aren't quite as nice as dominoes. I will concede Dominos isn't 3 times better as the price would indicate though. I like the Tesco 'take away night' ones in the blue and red boxes.

My plans for today? WFH, some vidya and a beer run
Cheers x
<comment>
WFH - the sophisticated mans method of NEETing. 2500 a month to do as he fucking pleases. What vidya and what beers?
<comment>
this is pretty fucking cringe lad.
<comment>
eh, that picture is actually from about a decade ago when I was back in school. I've moved out since and have a better setup now (monitors still going strong though).
<comment>
Afternoon lollers. Is today a wagie holiday as well?
I've been to the dosscentre, and watched dossmaster, smoking a dude doss cigarello about to play dosscraft, and I need to set up the dosstop still with doss lite OS.
Do you like the alcohol free beers? I have tried a couple but think they tasted a bit weird.
<comment>
don't tell porkies lad, that's a recent picture.
<comment>
It hurts me to do so, but it's for the good of things and I'm glad she's taking it seriously. In this situation, I am the lovesick fool
<comment>
I wish it was, I have many happy memories in that room, I'd love to go back and play Chrono Trigger for the first time over the course of a long carefree summer.

I wouldn't do that. I'd take him for a pint and countersign his passport application. If he's a real person, that is. Character seems a bit on the nose sometimes

Actually something similar did happen to me once. I woke up on a roof of a house on Crete. I was meant to be on Crete but not there. The owner of the house blasted me with a hose to get me down.

What are you getting, will it be patisserie goodies to have watching movies?
Good afternoon mate!
That's a lot of doss, be sure to take a break or you'll be too tired for your main doss hahaha. 
They didn't have the ones I like so I have larger tops and a bottle of mocktail. Also my friend gave me this capsule with liquid THC, so he says it is and desu is smells like weed, so I'll be trying that out later. 
Give me a shout on the discord if you need anything.

Still on the PS4 for what I play I don't think I can justify getting a PS5 yet and PS4 is still getting new games like Forbidden West, Resident Evil 4 remake and FIFA23.

Fockin 'ell laddinghams, what a shitshow this was
Fucking girlfriend definitely has bipolar disorder or sommet
She suffered yet another paranoid episode while on call earlier, followed immediately by a nervous breakdown out of nowhere complete with crying and sobbing to me on the phone - That, or she really knows how to fake an extremely convincing one...
For now she apparently doesn't want to meet up again at all, so i'm just gonna wait and see if she'll make up her mind at some point in the near/mid-term future. 
Maybe/probably she's already cheating on me with some rando chad in her home cunt and keeps psychologically projecting this on to me; Basically most everything she accuses me of/says she suspects me of pulling she's pulling herself by the looks of it, it's that femoid ""logic"" at work here and all.
But yeah, there's definitely no pleasing this woman no matter what i do or don't; At the same time i will not kill the relationshit thougheverbeit - That one's going to be completely on her if she decides to do so (and yes, she'd blame me for it too of course since womanoids are biologically incapable of taking responsibility for their own - mostly irrational and erratic - actions) 
Fucking rain started pouring as well almost at the exact same time she started sobbing on me, lol. What a complete fucking shitshow really

im 22 and feel like its over
ive been fucking anxious and depressed all my life and the only reason i didnt kms when i was a kid was because i had hope that id suddenly become a cool skater emo boy with a cute emo gf and become a rockstar or some shit like that, kept on holding out hope that it'd happen for years but it never did because i was an autist that fucking hated himself and obviously autism + self hatred = no charisma and no drive to put myself out there
now that im graduating uni in a month i wanna fucking kms because i feel that all the chances i had to turn this shit around have passed me by and now it's impossible for me to live the life i wanted
no friends, khv (got hugs tho), no parties, no meaningful personal growth
i almost unalived myself when i was 16 and 19 because i fucking hated life so much, but hung in there merely because i thought id become cool and get an emo gf on my dick somehow, should have just gone ahead with it then lol
i don't wanna hang out with adults and do boring adult shit, i wanna be a zoomer. i wanna go skatepark and start a band and fall in love with mentally ill adhd girls
mid 20s women are incompatible with me, too much baggage and expectations of having my shit together, im basically not attracted to anyone over 21 kek, miss me with that shit lol
i feel my only option is to larp as if im 18 again and give myself another slate
there are scholarships i can apply for that let me go to uni in japan/korea/taiwan for free, or i could go to uni for free in argentina
the competition is hard but it's my only shot. i only have two chances to make it work before im too old to qualify but i feel this is my only ticket out of here
i know im weird for trying to be a zoomer in my mid 20s and somewhat sleazy for trying to date 18 and 19 year olds in my mid 20s but this is all i have, this is all i fucking have and the only thing i ever fucking stayed alive for
and if i can't get this then i'll kms

Dont drink too much lad we dont want you down A&amp;E again haha
<comment>
Oh yeah, I remember stressing about that now. Needing it signed by someone who already has a passport and is in employment, absolutely ridiculous. Fucking impossible if you don't have friends. I got away with not needing a professional though, ended up asking a girl I knew since I saw she recently posted about having went on on holiday, she did it all online and thankfully no problems.
Terrible system though, definitely not NEET friendly at all.

imagine if women were actually stronger and were the hunters corr

Exactly. That's why I wouldn't bother. Just get rejected every time. Neets are meant to stay at home.

It's a reminder to any lads in their early 20s to stop fucking boozing and smoking. It will age you badly. Take note lads.
<comment>
cooor definitely played a part in my foot fetish and older women fascination haha. Yes Dinosaurs! had many toys as a kid and adored jurrasic park like many others. So far im watching cowboy bebop because it reminds me of firefly has good action and sentiment to it plus the episodes are only 20 mins uhm and vindland saga because its vikings and I wish Thors was my dad haha.

Don't like the overly perfect hairstyle. It's a wig right?
<comment>
kill yourself you sad cunt
<comment>
Got some alopecia I reckon. That might be why she wears a wig.
<comment>
Only flaws on her is her wonky eye and teeth (which can be fixed).
<comment>
Ruth has a wonky eye too.
<comment>
Lovely blue eyes too. A trait I love.

He's got a thing for slightly bong-eyed lasses with blue eyes who look as young as possible.
<comment>
She does indeed. She's a bit insecure about that though as she took those videos down.
<comment>
I will check out Cowboy Bebop if I can find a torrent!
I hope you enjoy this anime!

I also recommend Asura anime movie. It isn't the SOL I normally watch and its very very good.

<comment>
Just spent the last 8 hours edging. Having a rest before doing another 3-4 hours
I feel young again
<comment>
I wouldn't say she looks "young". She's 23 and looks no older than 25.
<comment>
Sorry lads I linked you the TV series and not the anime series.

<comment>

Don't be stupid. You just sit here getting called a cunt all day and night because you like drumming up attention for them and more importantly for yourself.
<comment>
I'm a full time dosser mate. Nobody hires long term neets. I don't really like the thought of supporting Chads and Stacys. Working without ever having love is brutal.
<comment>
Liked the part too where she actually accused me of hacking into her whatsapp (???) "because it showed some connected device that wasn't there before" (?????)
Fucking lol really. She also keeps putting tape over her smartphone's camera lenses "so no one can spy on her" or sommet
The woman really has some sort of bipolar-paranoid disorder she either doesn't know about or that she's hiding from me on full fockin purpose
<comment>

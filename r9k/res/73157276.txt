He is 27. He believes those fake hookup/dating sites are real. The ones called things like "shag2nite", "slags4u", "milfdating". So obviously fake from the name, but that wasn't enough to put him off. He then proceeds to show me messages he's got from the singles in his area. The messages are obviously fake but his face is so happy when he's showing me all this. How the fuck can someone this young believe this crap is real? And before you ask, yes I've told him they're fake. But he then tells me that they can't be because they mention his name in the messages. I tried a bit more to convince him but it was hopeless. God I feel bad for him

I don't think he has. When one of the bots asks for money hopefully he'll figure it out or just call the bot a gold digger. Either is fine

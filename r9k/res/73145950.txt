how come when someone blocks me i cant view their profile and keep harassing them on my other accounts, i tried changing my ip but still does that, did these jews install something in my pc while i was not looking?
Are you using the app? Delete it and redownload. And if you are just using browswer then delete your cookies/history or use private browsing. When you are blocked it does something with the cookies/data so that any new accounts you make get tagged with the block too. 
Create a new fresh account either in private browsing window or after having deleted and redownloaded the app
i dont remember well, i think i tried that too and it still somehow got me, altough when i joined on an older account i wasnt blocked, it's really weird

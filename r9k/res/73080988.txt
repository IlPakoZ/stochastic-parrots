Why are you mean to trans people?
<comment>
Because ftm or mtf, the trans people I've met irl have mostly acted like little boys or girls instead of men or women. I personally don't care what's between people's legs and I swing both ways, but I want to interact with grown adults, not people with the mentality of preteens thinking that either gender is only what they are like in childhood, ya feel me?

Denial of reality should always be shamed, if not criminally prosecuted.

trannies are limbs of an egregore who extrudes into our reality in ways harmful to people and other egregores that i care about. im doing my part to push back by making things a little bit more hostile

if you're ever interested in someone but put off by it, I'd keep in mind that that's usually a temporary thing. trying out dumb stereotypes about gender and putting a lot of importance on them is something cis people usually go through in middle school when they're figuring themselves out. trans people often get it on a delay because we don't always get the chance the first time.

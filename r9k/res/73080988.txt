Why are you mean to trans people?
Because ftm or mtf, the trans people I've met irl have mostly acted like little boys or girls instead of men or women. I personally don't care what's between people's legs and I swing both ways, but I want to interact with grown adults, not people with the mentality of preteens thinking that either gender is only what they are like in childhood, ya feel me?
Denial of reality should always be shamed, if not criminally prosecuted.
Is this about the wonders of ffs?
trannies are limbs of an egregore who extrudes into our reality in ways harmful to people and other egregores that i care about. im doing my part to push back by making things a little bit more hostile
hunter schafer has disgusting octagonal botched man breasts
cuz theyre weird and gross.
duh retard
Because they and the establishment behind them are trying to force me to indulge their psychotic delusions.
if you're ever interested in someone but put off by it, I'd keep in mind that that's usually a temporary thing. trying out dumb stereotypes about gender and putting a lot of importance on them is something cis people usually go through in middle school when they're figuring themselves out. trans people often get it on a delay because we don't always get the chance the first time.

So um, what did I do wrong?
I matched a female girl if that wasn't obvious.
I want to make a tinder but I'm embarrassed I've never posted face online before. What's it like?
Nothing. Now enjoy the rest of your life without tinder.
You're low test and have anxiety, just send her a message and then do something else for a while. I personally mute tinder notifications entirely because notifications from women make me cripplingly nervous.
Don't bother with Tinder. I've used it before and gotten zero results, even with matches. I message a match, and they don't respond.
seriously though OP if you're not chad most likely they would've either unmatched you or just wouldn't respond. You saved yourself time.
It was very awkward getting selfies, I didn't want to ask someone to take a pic of me. So I went into my bathroom with my phone out, and decided not to take pics. I had to convince myself again to take a selfie but I only took one. Tinder requires 2 minimum so I just used my kitty cat as the second pic.
Yeah I am, sometimes people think I'm gay or something, but I guess posting gay memes doesn't help lol
Ugh I think I give up on all dating things, I even tried /soc/ and none of that worked out. I give up on finding a gf!!!
le xd rawr :3
it is like this.

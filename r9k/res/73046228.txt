I want to make a tinder but I'm embarrassed I've never posted face online before. What's it like?

Nothing. Now enjoy the rest of your life without tinder.

You're low test and have anxiety, just send her a message and then do something else for a while. I personally mute tinder notifications entirely because notifications from women make me cripplingly nervous.

Don't bother with Tinder. I've used it before and gotten zero results, even with matches. I message a match, and they don't respond.

mfw they all swiped on me by accident 
seriously though OP if you're not chad most likely they would've either unmatched you or just wouldn't respond. You saved yourself time.

It was very awkward getting selfies, I didn't want to ask someone to take a pic of me. So I went into my bathroom with my phone out, and decided not to take pics. I had to convince myself again to take a selfie but I only took one. Tinder requires 2 minimum so I just used my kitty cat as the second pic.

You're low test
Yeah I am, sometimes people think I'm gay or something, but I guess posting gay memes doesn't help lol
Ugh I think I give up on all dating things, I even tried /soc/ and none of that worked out. I give up on finding a gf!!!

Get one those watering cans at the dollar store and fill it with water.
Keep a small towel next to the toilet. 
Take a shit. 
Wipe 2 times. 
Pick up watering can, cup your hands underneath your ass while pouring watering can between your legs. 
Wash until clean. 
Dry asshole with small towel.

<comment>
I shower twice a day (morning and before bed), one more if I workout. Its pretty common that I shit about 3 times per day, usually can't get all the shit out in one go so I wait for the bowel movement that makes it easier to push the rest out
<comment>
I take really messy shits so I always go for a shower after I shit, i shit once a day so it works out fine.
<comment>
why not wait to just shit once at the end of the day? unless its absolutely urgent you can hold it

Don't really like the feeling, my stomach feels weird and walking feels uncomfortable when I know I have some that I can let loose.

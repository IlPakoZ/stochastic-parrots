Good morning. Follow up of >>73010642 
I don't think the people who care about it are here but I'll say it anyway. I'm sorry about how I acted at last night. I've encountered a lot of friends I've lost. Mostly by them forgetting I exist. I didn't want to be manipulative or make you sad. I really just wanted a friend. When it was at the end, my mind was just racing and racing and I just thought, "well if it really am seen as so untrustworthy then I may as well earn that rank". However, with a cooler head that wasn't gonna fix anything and only burn out what little of a bridge may have been there. Perhaps it was motivated by another fight I got in that day, but the blame is still solely on my shoulders. I thought most things were okay then and never realized they were hard problems between you and me. It's funny because I get told I don't talk irl and it hurts the relationships I have there. Meanwhile me talking was the main reason I scared you. I never wanted to be a villain to you, but that is where I ended up being. I wanna end it by thanking M for talking me out of it. I also just wanna say I hope you get many more friends in the future that are nothing like me. Ones you can enjoy and appreciate without a looming fear over them. I already removed myself from most things so you don't have to see me. The only thing is I think steam and something else but I don't know how to do that. I wish you all the best and I'll try to grow from this. I'm sorry again. Chao
I can already tell you learned nothing and won't grow from this. The fact you aren't just taking the lessons and moving and instead blog posting her a-fucking-gain only shows that you want attention. 
You're likely right. I haven't learned a thing. However, I wanted to just say sorry one last time and work ok myself. To say I learned anything between then and now is disingenuous. I just wanna make my peace and end it there.
Stop saying, start doing.
I understand. I will get to it as soon as I can

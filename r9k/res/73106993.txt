Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving.

Summer being less hot. Fuck the heat.

What are cognitive functions? I know that between extroversion and introversion I prefer introversion. Between sending and intuiting I prefer sensing. Et cetera. Is that not MBTI?
What are cognitive functions?
NTA but it's what 16personalities test omits and what MBTI is originally based on
Simplified explanations for functions if they're in first position of the stack (of highest preference for the type) are:
Dominant Extraverted Sensing (Se): Directing energy outwardly and acquiring information by focusing on a detailed, accurate accumulation of sensory data in the present
Dominant Introverted Sensing: Directing energy inwardly and storing the facts and details of both external reality and internal thoughts and experiences
Dominant Extraverted Intuition: Directing energy outwardly to scan for new ideas, interesting patterns, and future possibilities
Dominant Introverted Intuition: Directing energy inwardly to focus on unconscious images, connections, and patterns that create inner vision and insight
Dominant Extraverted Thinking: Seeking logical order to the external environment by applying clarity, goal-directedness, and decisive action
Dominant Introverted Thinking: Seeking accuracy and order in internal thoughts through reflecting on and developing a logical system for understanding
Dominant Extraverted Feeling: Seeking harmony through organizing and structuring the environment to meet people's needs and their own values
Dominant Introverted Feeling (Fi): Seeking intensely meaningful and complex inner harmony through sensitivity to their own and others' inner values and outer behavior
https://sakinorva.net/library/contextualizing_functions
Typical "healthy" behaviors of the type pair primary and auxiliary functions, typical "unhealthy" behaviors of the type pair primary and tertiary functions in a "loop" and/or fixate on the inferior function for a "grip."
ISFJ = Si-Fe-Ti-Ne, but real function dynamics play out deeper than what descriptions of separated functions could provide. For example, pic describes how 4 functions may work by their position, and expands to 4 shadow functions - "opposites" by i/e - of that "main" stack.

I posted the following in the other thread got only incel emotionally immature lashing in response. Anyone here with a mature take?
INFP female here looking for some fellow NF perspective
So I've been in a long-term relationship with a nice guy I grew up with and starting formally dating in HS. Flash forward to now where I have only 3 semesters left in college. He decided not to go to school and started working instead, so I was sort of on my own on campus. He and I have the understanding that while I am in college we are not exclusive and are free to see what happens. That doesn't mean either of us are going to go looking for anything or pursue someone necessarily. It just means that it's college and anything can happen. He's fully committed even though I never required it, and honestly that's what I love about him. He's sweet and loyal to a fault. However, he's pushed for exclusivity from me for a few years now and I don't think it would be right to promise him exclusivity until after I graduate. For me, waiting until I can actually keep my promise feels like the right thing to do. It wouldn't be right to make a promise you might not be able to fully keep even if you mean to at the moment you make it. Circumstances can change. So I feel like I'm having integrity here and doing the right thing by not promising exclusivity until after I'm graduated. But people I'm close to that I have confided in have said that I'm not doing the right thing. They've said that I'm being selfish EVEN THOUGH I never expected exclusivity from him. That was just his choice.
Anyway, it's a really complex and complicated situation and I wouldn't mind another INFPs perspective on this.
They've said that I'm being selfish EVEN THOUGH I never expected exclusivity from him. That was just his choice.
did you tell him that you are not being interested in having exclusivity with him? or did you not say anything on this at all?
Look, there's a guy from one of my compsci courses and we did things together when he needed comforted after a bad breakup with a girl who didn't value him. That situationship was the closest thing that came to what some might consider being another relationship
It's not that uncommon to do things with your male friends while on campus
tell some details on this
there actually may be your bf's fault if any at all
I told him that I can't offer exclusivity with him for now but would after college and when things are settled and less hectic. I'm not going to make any conscious efforts anymore to pursue things outside of our relationship but realistically speaking things happen on campus plus the sorority I'm in is on the rambunctious side. If you aren't open to vibing with the campus lifestyle then you'll be excluded.
He was fully aware of this and it was his choice to be one-way exclusive to me. It's not fair for him to expect that from me when I never put that expectation on him in the first place. He hasn't given an ultimatum or anything. And he's not even that upset about it. He just keeps asking and saying he would prefer that I not be open to enjoying my last year of college.
ESTJ
Summer being less hot. I love dirt. Makes adventure biking more fun.
Not really, but I do like to avoid stepping on the lines when it's easily avoidable.
I don't even wash them out. No way I'd bother putting on caps.
I told him that I can't offer exclusivity with him for now but would after college and when things are settled and less hectic
He was fully aware of this and it was his choice to be one-way exclusive to me
this is just really sad
I'm not going to speak I'll of my bf. I love him dearly and he doesn't deserve any blame. 
I don't want to go into too many details about the guy too much but he had a bad breakup with a girl who used him. I knew then and there that I was meant to provide comfort to him, and to show him a better example of females. I was meant to help him heal. To show him that he wouldn't just be used. Did we do things physically? Yes, but it was from a standpoint of universal love, not romance.
We have a strong relationship of mutual understanding. Just because it's not conventional doesn't mean it's sad.

summer being less hot. i live in a place where none of the houses have built in AC because it's not supposed to get really hot. the last few years of heat waves have been brutal!
when you're walking on tiles, do you adjust your step to the patterns and lines?
depends on my mood, but usually i dont adjust
do you put caps on empty bottles before throwing either out?
caps on! i don't really know what i would do with the caps otherwise.
And people say INFPs have strong principles and morals....
You are either bait or an awful human being.
Or, y'know, both
it sounds like there isn't much of a problem to me, and i figure there won't be one as long as you guys keep communication open like you are now. it might be a good idea, at some point, to sit down and have a long conversation about exclusivity, though. 
part of me thinks he might see your hesitance to become exclusive as a lack of dedication, but it doesn't sound like that's true from your perspective. clearing the air would be good
Thank you for being understanding and not jumping to conclusions Anon. That's welcomed. 
Yeah, there isn't much of a problem between my bf and I. I think that's where people might be misunderstanding things. It's just difficult because I know that I'm doing the right thing by not making a promise I can't keep, and I'm just looking to be reassured. Not many people are onboard with universal love. When I say that I love everyone, I mean that I really do love everyone equally but at the same time my boyfriend is earthly special. We are spirits having a human experience and the spirit in me loves all but the human aspect love my bf dearly and is full committed to a lifelong pairing with him.
Thank you though. Your reassurance is a breath of fresh air around here. As an INFP I don't get a lot of reassurances. It's mostly people "should"ing me. Should do this. Should do that. So thanks again for not shoulding me
Hey, other INFP here
You're a fucking whore and you should kill yourself, that's my perspective ^^
universal love
No clarity
That's your unhealthy ego whoring around because it feels suffocated by commitment
bf is a handy plan B emotional asswipe with no backbone
"earthly unlike the wide universal love"
You're looking down on him lol, probably because you hate how he has the guts to be committed, even if in a stupid way
I see the peanut gallery is out in full force tonight huh
i'm not really up-to-speed on concepts like universal love or earthly spirits, i just figure that as long as your boyfriend knows about all this stuff, and you guys talk about it like adults, it's probably fine. i don't want to be blindly reassuring you, either, just my two cents
Doesn't seem to be a problem for you since apparently you're looking for aggressive male attention to compensate for your lovers being beta
Are you just non exclusive in theory or did u ever actually do things with other people than your bf? And does he know about it if so?
What are their types? Mind the dynamics here!
lol the INFP gigawhore was so desperate for the acceptance and approval she was clearly fishing for that she thought she received it from someone just because they weren't also calling her out for being the massive cheating whore she is
Why are INFPs like this?
INFJ and ENFJ
Yeah I've done things but nothing romantically. Just free spiritual love and comfort. 
My boyfriend knows, but obviously I don't tell him all the explicit details. I don't want to trigger his insecurities.
Just curious, but what was the compsci Cha- ... I mean the compsci Guy's type? The guy that you "comforted and helped heal" ?
I need to read more Jung to see if a merge of shadow projection and anima/animus projection is real...

summer being less hot
i do not notice any supposed extra "dirt" in spring in excess of other months, other than it being somewhat muddier if it's raining. I don't mind dirt regardless
when you're walking on tiles, do you adjust your step to the patterns and lines?
sometimes, if it's not going to alter my walking speed or gait too much
do you put caps on empty bottles before throwing either out?
depends on the trash can/recycling bin or the drink in question. if it's bottled water or something not sticky - I don't really make a concerted effort to put a cap back on. if there's a bag in the bin - again don't make a concerted effort. if it's a soda, i may put a cap back on so the bin doesn't get sticky.
what is "free spiritual love and comfort"? is that like code for casual sex? also are you a femoid (bio)?

Somebody get Centaur on this!
LARPer missed the "body reflects spirit" basics
oof
He never tested but I typed him as an ENTJ. 
Yes I am biologically female. The word "casual sex" carries negative connotations. There's no good word for this. Connecting with someone on a deep level emotionally and sometimes but not all the time it can involve physical contact. One of the ways you express love for someone can be through physical touch and cuddles, and sex is honestly just an extension of cuddling when you think about it. It's cuddling but extra. It's a natural progression, and our spiritual selves understand this even if our earthly, lower selves suffer from insecurities.
when you think about it
I'm thinking this is a grotesque false flag satire on INFPs because someone's still seething about them from last thread
It's always funny how when INFPs are actually honest and reveal their true colors in these threads you have coping INFPs and infp lovers/apologist claiming larps or psyops or whatever just because the optics don't look good lol

Damn, I got INTP again! It's been over 10 years since my first test, and I really thought I changed. Still not sure whether I'm really introverted, or just a very selective extrovert who ends up alone due to circumstances beyond my control. Disclaimer: I also have diagnosed autism.
if you could choose between Spring having less dirt and Summer being less hot, what'd you pick?
I enjoy the variety of seasons and can't entertain such theoretical scenarios, especially because "less dirt" is vague and ambiguous. I will say that I would rather be too hot than too cold, like I would take sweat and sunburn over shivers and sniffles. 
when you're walking on tiles, do you adjust your step to the patterns and lines?
Yes, but I think this is an autistic behavior. I will also add that when walking on public walkways like sidewalks that have a clear line in the middle, it is very frustrating when people drift into my lane, or when people walking die my side don't move over on their half or go single file to pass me.
do you put caps on empty bottles before throwing either out?
If outside usually yes, unless I could use the cap for a useful purpose later, such as pressing a crosswalk button I don't want to touch. At home there are often bottle caps on the floor that I pick up when I get around to cleaning up later.
Samefag here. Just a moment ago, without even thinking about this thread, I took a drink form a water bottle, which was nearly empty, and I dropped the cap and it rolled away, and my first thought was I'll pick it up tomorrow. That was a really strange coincidence.
Synchronicities find a way
using the cap to press the crosswalk button is pretty clever! i'll have to remember that next time i go out to buy a drink.

They're all bad
memes on Jung are underrated ngl
you completely misunderstood my intent
INFPs and INTPs are both Introverted, Intuitive, and Perceiving, preferring to be alone, think about the future, and avoid strict plans. However, INFPs process information emotionally and tend to prioritize feelings when making decisions, while INTPs prioritize logic when making decisions.
hell yeah child meth set
Wha? I was merely stating that I think it's cute what ur doing that's all.
And I was merely asking you if you had any similarly unusual habits to share, that's all.
Hmmm, maybe that when I'm on a public toilet or similar I try to stagger my handwashing or shorten/lengthen it, so I can just like use the chance of someone else opening the door to not have to touch the handle.

how does compatibility and "function feeding" work?
First of all look here
https://falconnl.github.io/TypeSquare
As far as common consensus goes, you may notice first and last letter differences always give good pairing unless beyond this there's only second letter changed
Exclusively second and third letter differences may lead to something good only if it's not "both"
That's it for handy noted
But, some rare info - if you start thinking in cognitive functions and then look at position chart in pic here >>73108002 you will notice that a big role at play here are the archetypal marks between the types' functions
Beyond complete shadow flips generating interested like you've noted there's also to look out for things like "hero" function (e.g. Se doms) looking up to "child" function (e.g. Se tertiaries), "hero" for one being "demon" for other leading to a mess, and so on.
And of course it's all as good as bogus if the people involved are "mature" and are not unconsciously led by archetypes dictating their "fate"

Spring having less. Summer needs to be warm for me. I don't have seasoning nal depression or anything, but the mechanism for me is similar. My moods match the season, and vice versa. Everything influences. Summer is a great time, so is spring, but the warmth of summer after experiencing cold feels so nice on the heart. It's a time to shake off the past year. It's a time of renewed beginnings. Summer without warmth isn't summer. 
Wintertime is when my ex dumped me, so summer has special significance to me. I associate the cold winter with her coldness (or rather my own coldness being cause) and the warmth of summer associated with new life. I wish I had never pushed her away. 
when you're walking on tiles, do you adjust your step to the patterns and lines?
When I was young. Not anymore. Now I have too many thoughts to process, so the fault lines escape notice. Unintentionaly allegorical, but I digress.
do you put caps on empty bottles before throwing either out?
Whoops. I hope you mean before recycling. The environment is important and nobody seems to care that global warming fast becoming a train, ran away. 
I make it a point to clean out my plastics and wash the nasty off anything I put in the recycle. I do it out of consideration for the workers handling it at the recycle factory.

Bullshit.
Hover your mouse over a type (or click it if you're on a mobile device) to see the Socionics relationships between the selected type and the others.
Socionics masquerading as other systems. Equivocating all of the systems does not magically make this square valid for anything but socionics
Bullshit
Can and could you log in as FalconNL and say in the page that it's bullshit? Your reasoning of "if there can be an attempt of translation then it's masquerade" just doesn't make sense by itself.
What? It very clearly states that the relationships are from socionics. Adding some vague comment about mixing the systems together means nothing, especially since there is no individualized description of specific type relationships and just a vague summation of socionics intertype relations
Think of personality type as an inclination like being right or left handed. Although some types more often get along with certain types better, the more important factor for compatibility lies with personal direction.
For example, one ENTP may place more importance on sensory details, and another may place more importance on logic. The former would be more drawn towards ESFPs and ISFJs while the latter would prefer ENTJs and INTPs.
I seriously hope you're just trolling...
It very clearly states that the relationships are from socionics. 
There's a systematic correspondence going beyond socionics, based on cognitive functions, noted above.
Adding some vague comment about mixing the systems together means nothing

In that literally nothing from any fucking system but socionics is included in the square you retard. He pretty much made an interactive intertype relationship box and added a little after-comment about mixing together a bunch of systems when the only fucking mixing was writing the types like ESTJ instead of ESTj to confuse people into thinking its MBTI.

A bunch of waffle that means he saw ISFJ and said hmmm that means IF(S) ESI. That still doesnt make it valid for any system but socionics and tricks people into thinking an MBTI ISFJ has this and that relationship with an MBTI whatever else when that is not how any of it works cause its fucking socionics and predicated on the ISFJ being an ESI and every other supposed MBTI type being their respective sociotype
In that literally nothing from any fucking system
A bunch of waffle
It's literally what the author made the table for, and it works.
see the Socionics relationships between the selected type and the others
The table serves more as a reference to save you the mental gymnastics of converting between the three different type representations
Since the shadow functions can be trivially obtained by horizontally mirroring the function stack (e.g. the INTP's shadow functions are Te-Ni-Se-Fi) I don't think adding them is really worth the extra clutter in the interface.

Alright retard I guess you are just incapable of understanding that none of this horseshit is MBTI. Do you think the author repeatedly asserting that he (((simplified))) it gives him any ground to stand on. It is a socionics intertype relation box lazily equivocated with MBTI for the sole purpose of marketability

Summer being less hot. I don't have to worry about dirt if I don't walk around in it. The heat on the other hand would make me sweaty regardless.
when you're walking on tiles, do you adjust your step to the patterns and lines?
Sometimes I'd do stuff like that for kicks. Similar to the "floor is lava" game that little kids play all the time.
do you put caps on empty bottles before throwing either out?

This INFP falseflagging has to be stopped.
INFPs are already treated badly by everyone and these posts are going to make them be persecuted even more!
How do you differentiate Ni v Si based on jungs definitions in psychological types? Both seem like types that are prone to delusion and being out of touch with reality.
Ni = No voluntary thoughts, psychic, never wrong
Si = Voluntary thoughts, no ability to understand things you've never encountered, rely fully on memory
Ni = Special witch powers
Si = Dumb and boring
Ni = Niggers
Si = CaucaSians
Make a throwaway email
Did Jung mention memories regarding si?
Most "INFPs" are just mistypes with depression.
Go visit /x/ and you'll change your mind.
wdym?
There's a lot of cool stuff on /x/
The closest I can find is in the Assimilation definition, which in a roundabout way implies Si involves comparing memory images to new conscious perceptions.
Assimilation is the absorption or joining up of a new conscious content to already prepared subjective material [11], whereby the similarity of the new content with the waiting subjective material is specially emphasized, even to the prejudice of the independent quality of the new content [12]. Fundamentally, assimilation is a process of apperception (v. Apperception), which, however, is distinguished from pure apperception by this element of adjustment to the subjective material. It is in this sense that Wundt says [13]: "This method of acquisition (viz. assimilation) stands out most obviously in representations where the assimilating elements arise through reproduction and the assimilated material through a direct sense-impression. For then the elements of memory-images are transferred, as it were, into the outer object, which is especially the case when the object and the reproduced elements differ so considerably from each other that the completed sense-perception appears as an illusion, deceiving us as to the actual nature of things."
I employ assimilation in a somewhat broader sense, namely as the adjustment of object to subject in general, and with it I contrast dissimilation, which represents the adjustment of subject to object, and a consequent estrangement of the subject from himself in favour of the object, whether it be an external object or a 'psychological' or inner object, as for instance an idea. 
Since Sensation is elsewhere defined as conscious perception I'm not sure what else he could mean by this other than using Sensation in an introverted way implies assimilation, which in other words means the classic "Comparing current sensations to memories" if I understood that right. The introverted sensor assimilates the object into his own subjective perceptions.
PS, since Assimilation is a subcategory of Appercepton you should probably understand that too.
Apperception Is a psychic process by which a new content is articulated to similar already-existing contents in such a way as to be understood, apprehended, or clear 
Something Jung was clearly dogshit at, but you can't blame him since he was an INFJ

if you could choose between Spring having less dirt and Summer being less hot, what'd you pick?
I mostly hate summer for the heat, therefore the latter.
when you're walking on tiles, do you adjust your step to the patterns and lines?
Yes and then I stop when I think about me thinking about it.
do you put caps on empty bottles before throwing either out?
I crush the bottle and put the cap on it (probably a recycling error in some cases).
Exactly the same as me for every question.
Centaur's had sex with at LEAST 500 people and that number increases by 100+ every year.
You'd think that based on my posts and behavior, but that fails to take into account my ick
Let's look around...
Introverted intuition apprehends the images which arise from the a priori, i.e. the inherited foundations of the unconscious mind. These archetypes, whose innermost nature is inaccessible to experience, represent the precipitate of psychic functioning of the whole ancestral line, i.e. the heaped-up, or pooled, experiences of organic existence in general, a million times repeated, and condensed into types.
Introverted sensation conveys an image whose effect is not so much to reproduce the object as to throw over it a wrapping whose lustre is derived from age-old subjective experience and the still unborn future event.
Sensation, which in obedience to its whole nature is concerned with the object and the objective stimulus, also undergoes a considerable modification in the introverted attitude. It, too, has a subjective factor, for beside the object sensed there stands a sensing subject, who contributes his subjective disposition to the objective stimulus. In the introverted attitude sensation is definitely based upon the subjective portion of perception.
In the introverted attitude sensation is definitely based upon the subjective portion of perception.
Whereas, the extraverted sensation-type is determined by the intensity of the objective influence, the introverted type is orientated by the intensity of the subjective sensation-constituent released by the objective stimulus.
introverted sensation is mainly confined to the perception of particular innervation phenomena by way of the unconscious, and does not go beyond them
Whereas introverted sensation is mainly confined to the perception of particular innervation phenomena by way of the unconscious, and does not go beyond them, intuition represses this side of the subjective factor and perceives the image which has really occasioned the innervation.

Ni v Si
So, a description could be something like 
impressions from assimilations of archetypes from the personal unconscious processes (whose contents can be triggered from conscious or unconscious)
VS
impressions from assimilations of experienced 5-sensations from the personal conscious moments (whose contents can be triggered from conscious or unconscious)
Or maybe not.
"Si" impressions can be ongoing, thus outlasting their "source" - certain experiences within the moment, so, with this, you probably could stick an interpretation of this functioning as some part of memory, somewhere.
Just maintain processes of integration into 8, bro.

Good for what? It's just a label to describe your preferences in exploring the world,

even if you've got presented with the label in 16p site.
There's a bit more to it - Thinking-oriented types may seek "validation" of their thoughts and reasoning, Feeling-oriented types may seek "problem solving / advice/ understanding the cause" on matters unrelated to rational reasoning.
It's because it insists upon itself

Nah, experiments with participants are only in sources 32-34.

i came up with this example. i dont think you should listen to me on this but i might as well bring it up.
so imagine 2 detectives: Smith and Navidson. 
Smith is the guy with a calk board with all the facts laid out with a red string. 
Navidson wanders around the city talking to people and inspecing crime scenes 
spoilers for my novel:
Detective Navidson sits in his old cruiser. he tries to smoke but finds his lighter painfully exhausted. so he finds muse instead solely with the storm. its a doozy no doubt, but hes seen worse. in the care of the car the rain outside only serves his mood well. but then there was the body. it had no care to be in and it showed; dark and black and what he hoped wasnt brown but knew was. Navidson didnt like to think about the body. he guided his thoughts then to Miss Holly. the rain was less heavy when they meet a few feet and a couple of hours away. the coffee was good; warm and sweet and black. he wondered at Miss Holly, her and the bacon- its almost like they knew the way he liked it. Miss Holly did and does not understand how much that bacon marveled him. maybe that was her privilege...

yeah ill give it a go. let me make some tea before you start please
and youll get your puzzle if i lose.
Bahh, you don't have to change the ruleset, it was only overwhelming because I was so worried about being on-time that I didn't think to use the time leading up to the game (even after it was pushed back) to brush up on the rules more. Really. It seems really fun the way you had it set up. I mean, I had fun even though I was only getting the swing of things very slowly.
Let Anonzzle decide I guess, but don't feel that you have to handle everyone with kid gloves just because of my poor preparation, haha.

INsomethingsomething most likely. I've noticed that overprotective(possessive?) Intuitives can sort of be...purists? Like if you display any Sensing at all your preference must be for Sensing, which just isn't true.
if you could choose between Spring having less dirt and Summer being less hot, what'd you pick?
L-less dirt? This made me (have you ever noticed there isn't a great word for something somewhere between "giggle" and "chuckle"? To say that I've giggled feels to me sometimes like I'm saying "I'm so cute and feminine!" because I've gotten bullied so hard in both directions all my life, either for being too tomboyish or too girly m-muh being muhself, muh muhltitudes, so to express *anything* that implies I think *anything* of myself one way or the other raises somewhat of an alarm in my nervous system. To have an identity at all feels like "asking for it". Ultimately I've come to love myself even more after being faced with this treatment, though, so no sympathy necessary, thank you. Anyways. Chuckle is so masculine, heartier. And many other synonyms for such things have connotations with the vibes all wrong.)...laugh.
could
implying I would
But to not be such a little stinker about it...Man. Nah, I thought on this for a minute. Muddy spring is good because we need the rain. Waterfalls! Puddle stomping! Mud baths! Hot summers are good because the snowmelt in the river is chilly no matter what, so hot days are the best for swimming so you can sun yourself on warm rocks when you hop out. That said, if I can kind of cheat by actually just maintaining my local Summer temps by counteracting global warming a bit, that'd be best.
when you're walking on tiles, do you adjust your step to the patterns and lines?
Sometimes. It's dependent on..something. I guess without overthinking it, probably..dependent on how stimulated I am. If something else has my attention, I'd probably just walk (but also would probably be thinking about how I'm not walking in the pattern I might otherwise want to on those tiles/stones/sidewalk squares/etc). I can be efficient and practical if I value whatever's necessitating that, like giving more energy to the conversation I'm having or being quicker about getting where we're going. I think the "we" is important psychoanalytical context and emphasis. I'm rarely trying to get anywhere quickly if I'm by myself.
do you put caps on empty bottles before throwing either out?
I recycle everything I can, so it's dependent on the recycling center's rules. But in any other case, yes, if something's likely to end up in a dump, I cap it to prevent any animals sniffing around from getting stuck.
i really liked the dune game. i look forward to playing it again with more people and the better rules and stuff
Nice!! :oD I'll get my booty off to work so I can hopefully be back around if you guys play again later tonight
"Advanced" just means everyone gets more abilities, there's two spice cards per turn instead of one, and there's an eldritch system of needing spice in combat. It's all a bit too fast to really help analyze anybody's personality though, so it's kind of a failure on that front. Maybe the Diplomacy game will be better if we ever get to 7 players, but even that might be too fast at 48, 24, 24 hours per turn idk.
More players and perhaps a better way of communicating might help with the interpersonal dynamics, but it's hard to replicate an IRL table online, and actual negotiations would probably slow any game down to a level that nobody will be happy.

It rains more and dirt washes up all over the streets.
I thought it was referring to snow melting in early spring causing lots of mud to be revealed.
Interesting. Where are you? I've never experienced that in the cities or suburbs of midwest America where I've always lived. All the streets are slanted into drains and there's never exposed patches of dirt anywhere (just grass or concrete), so streets are generally pretty clean after some rain.

Sounds like a very unhealthy Fe-Si. I detest office politics, most of them rely on being as condescending as politely possible.
Sure, if she promises to keep it clean.
if you could choose between Spring having less dirt and Summer being less hot, what'd you pick?
The second option, always. 
when you're walking on tiles, do you adjust your step to the patterns and lines?
Yeah, when I'm bored!
do you put caps on empty bottles before throwing either out?
Nope!
Is good that you're honest, but you'll want to make sure you and him are on the same page regarding your commitment to each other. But if you want my honest thoughts, this whole situation seems like a time bomb.
is there truth to the claim that being INxP 4w5/5w4 is living life on hard mode?
thanks for putting up with my existential bullshit kek
sorry for dragging you into it
It's always a pleasure to help, chuck. I hope things work out for you!
Do you have an addictive personality? Post examples of your addiction or times you evaded common addictions.
I've never been interested in drugs. I was curious about happy brownies for some time, but I never got into it either. I drink occasionally, but it's not something I particularly need. I think there are better ways to spend my time.
At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
It isn't truly a skill if you need drugs to do it correctly IMO. True skill takes effort and perseverance. Also, I don't want to disturb the dead.
Do you play by the rules? Or do you feel that "if you're not cheating, you're not trying"?
Cheating does have serious consequences depending on the situation, but if it's nothing too important, I don't care.
Also, I don't want to disturb the dead.
Maybe this is a living person-centric viewpoint. What if the dead enjoy being talked to?
None
that can't be true here
Nozzie said in the puzzle room that he hated the internet in relation to it blending his own culture with bizzare zoomer bullshit. And it got me thinking, for me to hate the internet I'd have to truly believe that I'd have become a great scientist if I didn't discover it when I was 14. But let's be real here, my stinky NEET older brother didn't need the web to drop out of school. I consider it a great blessing to be able to communicate with you guys and it really has broadened my horizons beyond my small town mindset I probably would have ended up with anyway, no matter how "promising" I was as a child.

Yeah INTP sounds about right, I didn't know you weren't sure. My edgier take would be ESTJ, but that's needlessly upsetting and basically the same anyway.

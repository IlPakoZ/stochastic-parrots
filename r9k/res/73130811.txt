How do you respond?
I would fuck the shit out of her then go get drunk together.
I think this chick is uber hot and exactly my type but I'd feel kind of weird about dating "myself." Like, she's not exactly the same because she had another 25 years to develop differently, but it'd be kind of weird. I don't even think I'd go after myself as a woman if I was in her place. I'd at least want to stay friends though.
so basically you're your own ideal gf meme? how are you connected? like you both have the same soul or continuous consciousness.
i'd say no if the last question is yes

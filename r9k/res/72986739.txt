Asian languages are only worth learning if you are a black man.

asian people literally fucking hate black people, like it's crazy how much they hate them. 
Actually they hate any non asian or even foreigners who are asian as well but black people specifically because dark skin is seen as bad in their culture.

I am not reading this because it threatens my /pol/ echo chamber and comes from social media platforms overwhelmingly used by women! 
Cope.

first job
cant get along with coworkers, all normies
basically am a mute around them
they come up with nickname for me
"Squeaky", referring to Wheezy from Toy Story who lost his squeaker
Making fun of me because I don't talk
I fucking hate this shit. I go to work so I can get a pay check, not to entertain boomers and geezers. Am I supposed to change who I am to satisfy these cunts? Keep in mind ive been there for almost half a year now so a lot of them have stopped trying to engage me in conversation, so they are all talking shit behind my back.

I go to work so I can get a pay check.
Then keep doing it, and don't care about them Anon.

You should have seen this coming. You were submissive and every time they poked further you submitted further until they feel comfortable giving you a degrading nickname. I may be an abject failure at life but I would have established immedietly upon the 1st shit test I would not be belittled or disrespected in any capacity. Being naturally handsome and supremely high IQ helps establish this respect but you gotta open your mouth firmly the first time they dismiss you or bark orders, you look them into their eye and speak your mind. Now its too late, if you try to act tough now you'll look weird and kinda mass shootery.
<comment>
You should learn how to be good at passive aggressive communication so you can goad them into acting funny/inappropriately, while you yourself don't cross any culpable lines. Or just be an asshole and stop being a faggot
<comment>
I will.
Pretty much.
I'm non-confrontational.
<comment>
I'm non-confrontational
Yeah, no shit "Squeaky"
Kek.
<comment>
I'm non-confrontational.
I'm going to get a doormat with this printed on it faggot
<comment>
So all they do is make fun of you for not talking? Being quiet is the only fault they can find in you? If so then I'd say you're doing pretty good, lad.
<comment>
Neither of you would do anything in my position.
<comment>
And what position is that; face down, ass up?
<comment>
anon i know this is a hard pill to swallow but the surviving in this world means being fake sometimes. everyone has a work persona. you will never succeed if you show your true personality at work. i don't know if you're only gonna aim for minimum wage jobs or something but you have to learn how to schmooze, squeaky
<comment>
Of course you'd say that, you can't even imagine someone not being a servile beta wimp in your own shoes.
Truth is Squeaky: I have actively avoided your position for my entire life.
<comment>
I got into a fight with this 200+lb roided guy at the publix parking lot do you think I won't softly remind frumpy managers how I expect to be treated?
<comment>
Why don't you fucking talk? Nothing to say? Boring little freak, you definitely feel superior to your coworkers.
<comment>
It's your first job and it's only been half a year. I would if I was you relax and try to enjoy yourself with the people you do get along with if any. You have many years of employment ahead of you so I think this is a good experience for you. But everyone has their own path. Maybe you oughta get a job in a warehouse or something where it's mostly dudes so it's not as bad maybe. There are shitheads everywhere though and a decade from now or even 5 years I'll bet you're gonna think what you're dealing with now isn't that bad at all.
<comment>
People are tribalistic, if you're not like them, they don't like you, and they'll show it.
I got it all the time while working, when I was working in a factory. They used to sing , like a 9 stone cowboy, to the tune of rhinestone cowboy, because I walk funny, and I don't weigh that much.
Normies are cunts, and people aren't much different on here at times.
We shouldn't have to change who we are, just to fit in their world.
<comment>
Maybe you won't think normies are cunts if you put in a shred of effort to be likeable and "fit in their world".
You get back what you put in, anon.
<comment>
I'm lucky my office job doesn't allow any kind of bullying, if someone dared to insult someone here they would be at risk of losing their job
<comment>
Yes, i know normies are cunts
<comment>
So if i put in nothing and am indifferent to them, then i deserve to be hated, bullied and reviled by my peers? Really? I have to dedicate my time to amuse and pander to the normies or they have a moral obligation to humiliate me to no end? You have a really fucked up worldview, almost like a normie.
"But he likes nerdy things!! I simply HAVE to bully and ostracise him!"
<comment>
Sure about that one pal? Sounds like you're the swishy 9 stone faggot on the team. Maybe if you put some effort into yourself you can earn some respect.
<comment>
Why should we make the effort with them, if they don't reciprocate?
Tried for a while to fit in, but if you're not like them, they don't like you. Sat for hours beating myself up because I'm not like them, trying to fit in their world.
The fuck has this place turned into? Normie fucks are all over.
<comment>
Yes I am certain of that. It is self evident really
<comment>
Why would anyone like you if you won't even make an attempt to be likeable?
You're not the protagonist anon, you're a spoiled baby.
<comment>
You need to work out who you're replying to, instead of just being a faggot troll.
<comment>
Wrong. He expects to be left alone not liked and not hated either
<comment>
Apologies that your post content is as forgettable and wimpy as the other dweebs in here.
<comment>
Why would he expect that? That was never guaranteed or promised.
Spoiled. Baby.
<comment>
If it was forgettable, you wouldn't have mentioned anything I said.
Sorry you're a genuine retard.
<comment>
Whatever you say, squeaky.
<comment>
I'll be le gruff alpha not take any shit, that'll show the normalfags 
It really doesn't fucking matter in the grand scheme of things, why bother making an effort if you don't want to talk to them anyway?
<comment>
You seem to be unaware of the glaring problem in your doctrine. Because you call me "not the protagonist", but the same obviously doesn't go for the other people in your view. Why should i like them and pander to them if they do nothing to appease me? In fact, according to you, everyone should hate everyone when they meet, because they aren't pandering to each other.
No, i'm not going to get buddy-buddy with the guy who calls me a faggot bitch, i'm going to fucking beat the shit out of him, you moronic jackass. You act as if we live in a fucking post-apocalyptic dystopia where no common decency exists and everyone is expected to kill anyone they come across.
<comment>
I think you're talking to a wannabe normie. Talks about changing yourself and being like them.
Why does he hold normies in such high esteem?
<comment>
Stfu faggot
Thats gay and for women 
Ofc they wouldnt theire fucking r9k queers theire too afraid to chat up some random girl.
If a girl just went up to them and said hi theyd have a panic attack.
<comment>
Larp from the basement of an obese neet
Here is a another hard pill to swallow, you will never be happy living a fake life. So man up and become real.
<comment>
theire
Somebody is quite eager to be insulting.
Poor eager troll.
<comment>

Normies all hate eachother
Kids dont like their parents
Parrnts dont like their kids
Women dont like their husbands
People talk shit about their friends and betray eachother
Everything is a farce
Qlmost everything you see is artificial or staged.
Almost everything you will hear are lies.
<comment>
i am happy with my life because I make money being fake at work with my coworkers and my boss, then come home and do whatever i want with my fat paychecks. i rest easy knowing my job won't be in jeopardy even if I fuck up, because my coworkers like me and are willing to forgive
squeaky fucks up once and it's over with because he can't form alliances
<comment>
No, i'm not going to get buddy-buddy with the guy who calls me a faggot bitch, i'm going to fucking beat the shit out of him, you moronic jackass
You won't do shit and that's why they call you a faggot bitch. Rightfully so.
<comment>
Dream on. I brag because I absolutely dominated him while stone af and dealing with chronic illness. I'm a beast of a man on all levels, and you couldn't look directly into my eyes fave to face.
<comment>
Ok, so you're trying to convince yourself of something.
<comment>
Why are you so threatened by a freakazoid spaz? Are you actual animals that must react aggressively to anything that doesn't conform to your preconcieved notions? You sound like absolute sociopaths. Read back what you said. "This man diesn't engage in banter while working. This means that i have the right, no, the DUTY to belittle, mock, and publically shame him." You sound like cartoon villains, lmao. Do better. Be better people.
<comment>
Cope and seethe of a lesser-born man
<comment>
I don't speak to anyone and nobody bothers me because i'm 194cm tall and muscular. People used to bully me back in high school until i got big and buff, then they just started ignoring me. Works for me.
<comment>
Ok faggottbitch
<comment>
Ya seethe nigger? Go look into your mirror.
<comment>

We literally live in a society

Why does he hold normies in such high esteem?
tbf I kinda see where he's coming from, it's easy to get wrapped up in the 
le normie good, le me (incel) bad hype
, especially if you're being/been bullied 
I know all of those posts I replied to were mostly if not all one peson, I just wanted it to be clear what I was replying to.
<comment>
"Squeaky"

<comment>
especially if you're being/been bullied
That shows they are not better than us, and we all lack something. Maybe they are lashing out at others for the things they don't like about themselves, but that is no excuse for being a cunt.
<comment>
unless you're literally not communicating like with what ur supposed to be doing at work, small talk and bullshitting does not matter
<comment>
This depends if OP is just socially retarded and doesn't know what to do or he feels he's too good to associate with normies and they can sense his arrogance. Spergs usually are the latter as they're solipsistic and lack the social awareness to understand they'll be consequences to their obnoxious behavior around "NPCs".
<comment>
I used to think it was because I was just a bad person that they treated me like that, sort of like that 
bullying is le eugenics and exists to punish the weak xD 
that an anon on this board is a very firm believer of and sometimes makes threads about "why bullying is good". Now I realise that I just happened to be very scrawny and very ugly in my teenage years, which made me a big target for other insecure teens.
<comment>

We fully understand because we've lived our entire lives around you. We just often think normalfags are obnoxious and not deserving of respect. Also you don't know what solipsism is
<comment>
You don't get to dictate who deserves respect when you aren't worthy of it yourself. Respect comes from the fear of something more powerful that yourself and normies innately recognize this falling in line in within the social hierarchy. Spergs don't which is why they get themselves into heaps of trouble when they don't adhere to any superior authority that they believe they're above or doesn't exist.
<comment>
I have a fren, who is married and has children, and 1 of his sons is a sperg, and he said he sometimes bullies him to get him to respond and fight back. I think he's seen what's happened to me over the years, and doesn't want that for his son. I've always lacked confidence, so I think building that would be a good start to helping him to be able to eventually react.
<comment>
I only made one of the posts by the way, dumbass
<comment>
actually bullying has been found to permanently inhibit confidence. his son is becoming more timid and tamer by the interaction.
they've found bullies tend to come from wealthier, more pampered, less antagonistic situations. That is, they have never had someone bully them or ever be aggressive to them and that's why they're so confident. If his son lacks confidence, its because his father hasn't provided him a wealthy spoiled enough life.
<comment>
Nice larp but I had a manager ask me if my one ear ring meant I was gay. I reported her and have it in writing with her supervisors signature on it. I'm waiting for them to keep fucking up and I will be filing a lawsuit. Can't wait for some free cash
<comment>
One ear ring? Lol fucking fag
<comment>
I've met bully types from working class backgrounds mainly, but get what you're saying.
I think a lot of people who have children think, my parents did X bad so I'll do the opposite. Nobody thinks about what their actions/behaviours could cause.
<comment>
That is a hard pill to swallow. Being fake is torture for me. Not OP, but ill take this advice in some way. Maybe ill practice by being a lil fake and be more fake as i go

What archetype best encapulates the loser virgin neet?
jester, sage and innocent.
jester is typical class clown who turned out to just be an insecure weirdo who tried making people laugh and liking him by doing and saying things others wouldn't.
sage is lonely because its fairly easy to surpass common knowledge in a field if you're interested. you have a need for ''higher'' knowledge so day to day small talk doesn't interest you, at best you get really good at faking it for others benefit.
innocent is a feminine trait and fucks you over as a male.

I emphatically resent the need to not just treat every persion with trust and compassion because half of them are exploitative animals who should be put down like dogs. How did we not get rid of them earlier in our evolutionary history, why do I have to second guess everything I say in counter to these vermin

I don't care about superiority or inferiority, I just want everyone to be trustworthy and nice

Does pity sex exist in reality? Do women ever feel like cheering up some miserable guy?

Do women ever feel like cheering up some miserable guy?
Women hate seeing men happy, so no.
<comment>
If you want pity you lack self-respect
<comment>
It can happen, it almost happened to me after I told a girl I am a sad virgin, she was hot to fuck me but I fucked it up, and she lost all pity after. For sure some few lucky bastards around the world are turbo incels but stumble upon a really hot but beta stacy who isn't arrogant or egotistical and will fuck him and love it. J repeat, it takes a beta very low self esteem woman to give pussy to an incel

If your Korean yea it does.

please be true
this is true ;_;
please be true

there have been a quite few instances where fembots have fucked the ugliest dudes here but there are too many of us and I am still a neet khhv wizard after all these years. you have better luck on tinder than finding somebody online truthfully
<comment>
If Chad is sad yes random women will come up to him and ask to ride his dick to cheer him up.
If Incel is sad though he should just kill himself.

I pity dated a guy but it never went past dates because I found him so ugly. I couldn't even kiss him. He was extremely fugly not deformed but you know how in anime/manga they draw characters really ugly as a joke? He looked like that
<comment>
chad is fucking ugly though
<comment>
One time I was really depressed and knew this guy that was beyond pity so he was worse off than me at the time so I had sex and felt better. I don't think I had sex with him because he was pitiful I did it for me.
<comment>
I always thought it was the other way around where I was giving them pity sex. I mean yeah your ass does look fat in that but I don't want to sit around for half an hour for you to still be fat.
<comment>
it's a lot better than going to a prostitute, it could be a life-changing experience, for some people the problem is that nobody has given them a chance
good for him that he had the confidence to even go on a date looking like that, I can't do that still
was he ugly or just a failed normie?
<comment>
I've seen it happen a few times.
Most memorable
was a circle of friends - me, my best friend, my GF, his GF (all of us 21 - 22) and his GF's older sister (26). The Older Sister was a slut.
My best friend's kid brother (18) was a loser. The 'can't look you in the eye, afraid to talk to women, if you teased him he'd cry' sort. He was in HS so he didn't come with us much but one Summer we rented a cabin in Florida and his parents convinced us to take him.
We tried setting the Kid Brother up with girls we met at the beach or bars but he always flubbed it. He refused to go with us to bars
After 4 days Older Sister said she was staying home from the bar when we went out, had a headache
Got back a few hours later and they were still at it in her room.
They kept it up the rest of the rental
He was really obsessed with her for a few months but by the time he got to uni he was over her and could actual get dates. Total transformation
<comment>
;_;
literally me, my life
<comment>
he was lucky have people around him that were actually concerned about his well-being, I never had that
<comment>
I pity fucked a (XX) girl once. She seemed to appreciate it.
<comment>
you can't be sure that any of this actually happened
<comment>
How do you know she wanted to fuck?
<comment>
one of the saddest questions ever....
<comment>
I have had pity sex with a bio Girl (raises hand)
<comment>
well?
Story?
Oregano story?
<comment>
was he ugly or just a failed normie?
he wasn't totally ugly he just pooped his pants in 3rd grade and everyone teased him still in HS so nobody wanted to be around him. I kinda knew him but not and I didn't think anyone would believe him even if he told
<comment>
very nice of you
<comment>
Sure
There was a girl in my English 105 class that was about the closest definition of awkward, spergy, and below average in looks. Never makeup, seemingly never owned a hair brush, arguably got dressed in the dark, and spoke in a near whisper.
She ended up in a group with me. She was a decent writer and one on one would look you in the eye sometimes.
Two years later I had her in my Lit 315 class and she was *shyer*. Ended up in a group with her again and she would still "peek out" every now and then. I invited her to my apartment with others from the class and she was obviously shocked, but said yes.
She got there very late and was kinda' uncomfortable. When other people paired up and left, obviously to hook up, or left to meet GFs/BFs she was sad. Finally it was just me and her. And she had had 2 beers. She was crying a little bit so I asked.
She was certain she'd die a virgin. No one would ever even touch her. No husband, no kids.
I tried to reassure her but it went on until finally, trying to shock her and get her to go home, I offered to take her virginity so she could relax about it.
She was VERY EAGER so I made her promise to understand were were just friends, not BF/GF
She was terrified, clumsy, and apologetic, but a good sport and willing. It was fun for me and I made sure she came three times.
I made her promise we wouldn't see each other for at least two weeks so she wouldn't slip
She didn't learn fashion, or makeup, or such but she was a lot more self-confident
<comment>
You don't belong here, chad
<comment>
No. I too imagined some bitch knocking at my door when I was a teen.
It never happened, she never cared I never got any sex. Just fuck prostitutes and do drugs or cope however you can.
<comment>
Someone has to answer the questions from actual experience
<comment>
Her change in behaviour after I fucked up I guess
No more random pics of her/selfies without even asking
No more good morning and good night messages
No more texting me first
No more asking me to go to the gym together
No more telling me "well I am single now :3" but instead telling me "I have a boyfriend"
Just my own deducing I guess..
<comment>
One of my biggest fantasies is getting pity sex but it will never happen unfortunately
<comment>
yeah, same, I want them to acknowledge that I'm pitiful and still have sex with me
<comment>
Does pity sex exist in reality?
If it existed before, and it supposedly did, it certainly does not exist now.
Do women ever feel like cheering up some miserable guy?
If he looks like Chad, I guess. Fuck apps and social media ruined everything.
I've had 20 years of misery where women could have fucked me happy for a while. They did not.
<comment>
My first gf's mom pity slept with me after gf cheated on me with Chad, before we got that far together
<comment>
I've gotten a pity BJ from a lesbian friend when I admitted it had been years since I had had sex. She joked about my size during and laughed when I came in under 3 minutes.
Now I have a mommy dom fetish. Fucking bitch.
<comment>
he was lucky have people around him that were actually concerned about his well-being, I never had that
I never had that
That's because you are a piece of shit who deserves to be miserable
<comment>
If it's a hot depressed guy wistfully smoking a cigarette or some shit maybe
<comment>
Half decent larp. 5/10 for the effort
<comment>
Ironically kind of experienced the reverse, where I dicked a lesbian because she'd never experienced it and admitted to wanting to have at least once in her life. She was soundly gay though, didn't turn straight or anything from what we did and still is today far as I know, but she felt better about it after.

eggman x eva
eggman x bwahh
eggman x peggy
eggman x wendy
eggman x pizza
eggman had LOTS of girls pity fucking him from r9k but he put himself out there a lot. same thing with samson
<comment>
I think pity sex is an outdated meme. male/female relations have changed drastically over the last few decades and the kind of mental states that would lead a woman to have sex out of pity simply don't happen any more because girls grow up differently now. culture is different now.
<comment>
It's a pretty shitty time to be alive as a lonely virgin
<comment>
his haircut is funny but other than that he's sort of normal, probably has a decent smile
interesting fantasy
<comment>
Years back, I made posts on /soc/ which were self deprecating saying I was ugly and lonely and wanted a gf. I got loads of adds (50+) but none of them wanted anything to do with me after they saw my face. To be fair, I'm a 2/10 though so you might have better luck if you're at least a 6/10 in the face
<comment>
if the man is chad then yes
<comment>
Why you think women won't pity sex you
you're ugly
you hate yourself
the world hates you
everyone hates you
you're a failure
Why women actually won't pity sex you
they don't even know who you are because you don't talk to anyone
they are concerned you may have STDs/trying to prevent STD spread
women still have to pay for birth control for the most part
abortion is not an option in a lot of places now thanks to religitard bullshit in 2022-2023
you waste your cum on porn and are too lazy to put yourself out there
you may not have very good hygiene
you will not play into the kinks of whores that will pity sex you because of your fragile male ego
most women are cringe femsubs anyhow and don't know how to be dommy, practically making femdom more marginalized than LGBT bullshit
I'm 28 and still never had sex outside of sex toys, and honestly if STD rates weren't so damn high right now I would feel more comfortable giving pity sex. But I also live in the Bible belt and most men here are completely unapproachable or niggers. Stacys control everything and the "Chads" here are still fugly lol.
<comment>
what do u have against niggers?
<comment>
Being ugly is the only reason a man can be incel. Low functioning autism too and disabilities. Every other "reason" is a meme
<comment>
I'm not black, they should stick with black women and coalburners.
<comment>
thats not fair i want to fuck a white woman that hasnt had sex with a black guy before. y wont u get fucked by a black guy like me once
<comment>
Yes. I had an ex that, when I broke up with him, he went to cry to a female friend of his, who just happened to be a massive whore (she had a bf) so she pity fucked him.
<comment>
Ugliness isn't just skin deep, many people are ugly inside too, both those attractive and unattractive. Beauty itself is subjective and honestly, I would probably be a normie had I not grown up in such a horrible place surrounded by rich people, gossips, and drug addicts.
<comment>
i want to fuck a white woman
That's not hard to find, buddy.
a white woman that hasnt had sex with a black guy before
Picky chooser, but also not impossible.
<comment>
basically i want to fuck all the white women
<comment>
what types of men would you pity sex?
<comment>
I wouldn't count him as miserable. It sounds like he was desirable.
<comment>
i don't believe you shared your pic with over 50 different girls from soc considering the fact almost all ghost without even reaching the point of exchanging pics
<comment>
the "Chads" here are still fugly lol
female celibacy in a nutshell
not even Chad is good enough.
<comment>
I shared my pic with around 12 and all of them either politely rejected me or ghosted me. A lot wanted to just talk, offer pity or advice and some never wanted to exchange pics but proved they were women too.
<comment>
it's a lot better than going to a prostitute
If you solicit prostitutes you also lack self-respect, and respect for women
<comment>
guys who beg for sex or want pity sex are creepy maybe it wasnt even your looks
<comment>
its hilarious eggy still claims he is an incel because he most definitely is not. dude is over 6'0 and had so many fembots throw themselves at him. if the guy was 5'4 he would be as permavirgin as some of us (Im a khhv neet wizard)
<comment>
non-chads who beg for sex or want pity sex are creepy maybe it wasnt even your looks
<comment>
It does but normally it's in the confines of a long relationship of two healthy parties. Many of wives will happily put out when the man they love is feeling down even if they get little or nothing out of it. But in the context of some girl you hardly know or a recent relationship hook up, it rarely if at all happens. 
The most depressing thing about the dissolving of traditional dating is concepts like "pity sex" are hardly understood anymore because we are in a culture now that just fucks for fun/status, rather than for a means of good pair bonding.
<comment>
You should always assume anyone that brags here is just making shit up. If you are really having it good you get a feeling of clownishness trying to shot it out to r9k of all places, and would sooner close the reply box than actually start humble bragging or otherwise.
<comment>
I wasn't looking for pity sex, more like a girl who could give me a shot as a bf. Someone who sees someone in my predicament as an ideal. Of course, it never happened
someone saying he got ghosted for being ugly is bragging now in 2023
Wow
<comment>
chads have begged for sex before and got it
<comment>
i just don't believe in blackpill theories, ik way too many uggo happily dating
why would chad beg for sex?
<comment>
He's a big guy with some charm. He just has some mild facial deformity. 
My grandpa was considered attractive and had women checking him until his late 80s despite having a very big crooked nose
<comment>
but how overweight are you exactly?
<comment>
I only have sex with prostitutes and I have banged some real hotties
Last girl who gave me "pity sex" she was some fat dumb teen who smelled like mayonnaise and laid there thinking she was doing me a favor LOL then said "wow you are really good at this"
<comment>
There are girls who will do it but they are the kind of turbosluts who are hated by you guys.
<comment>
Last girl who gave me "pity sex" she was some fat dumb teen who smelled like mayonnaise
Wow I feel sorry for her. Consider suicide without touching women next time
<comment>
not sure who hates them, I don't
<comment>
until his late 80s
Lmao, no way
<comment>
why would chad beg for sex?
autistic chads still struggle but if they shut up and beg for sex they get it. that incel the normies did a documentary on got sex pretty much right after it ended

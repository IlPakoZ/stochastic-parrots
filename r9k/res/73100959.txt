how come whenever I stay up past 24 hours to fix my sleep schedule I always violently start shitting every couple hours

I have literally no idea, but you're not alone. If I sleep very few hours my stomach starts to burp out these rancid smelling fumes as if I had eaten raw roadkill.
One time I burped just as I was leaving the dorm room and my roommates opened the fridge to check for rotten food. I have no idea why sleeping and stomach issues are related, but they are.

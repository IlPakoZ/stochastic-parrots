How do you unfuck yourself? Ever since my pornography/masturbation addiction my penis does not only look worse but it's smaller and I can't get strong erections anymore
Depression didn't help either. What do?
Is "just stop wanking and quit porn" gonna do it? Im a bit afraid

I have no advice but know you are not alone, Erectile dysfunction in my early 20s. It really fucks with my psyche being aroused but not having a hard penis. I am too ashamed to go to the doctors about it and afraid they wouldn't even be able to help. I went to the doctors once and he just talked down to be about how its in my head and I need to go to a therapist.

how often do you jack it? because if its more than once a day thats probably it. also if you're using drugs or meds you should check if thats it.
you can also have your T levels checked. dont accept the doctor telling you its fine, get actual numbers and look it up yourself. 
unless you're 60 your dick shouldn't just stop working.

Yes stopping wanking and quitting porn does it, even if you don't commit to it fully, as a last resort just take some dick enhancing and erectile dysfunction stopping pills and you'll be good, I heard they work for old people so you should be fine, and keep your T levels in check, exercise, take vitamins, eat meat, all that shit.

only thing close to ED i ever had was after going sober and just losing my sex drive completely for a few days. 
dunno what its like to be aroused and not getting hard tho, must be hell.

Oh I've jacked of NUMEROUS times during my depressive phase. Im talking pulling all nighters watching porn, skipping sleep, starving myself, not getting sunlight. The whole package. Now I'm slowly healing mentally. Did start my nofap journey two days ago. My libido is very low

Shockwave therapy helps ED

you have to see for yourself if you need to swear off jacking it entirely, take a break from it or whatever but staying up all night jacking it isn't healthy you know that. i notice for myself that after a certain time of jacking it more than once a day i dont get as hard as i could be, i always went back to normal if i stopped tho. long term that isn't good for your dick either but it will heal some if you leave it alone.

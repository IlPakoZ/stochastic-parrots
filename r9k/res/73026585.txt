does anyone else feel like the only way they could ever truly love someone is if they were almost the exact same person? and since that's not very likely, i fear i will spend the rest of my days lonely

only ever since i was born anon
pretty sure most people have that feeling but it really is impossible. there is probably only like 5-10 actually probably like 1-2 people in the world who share close to almost all your similarities, but never 100 percent, otherwise they wouldnt be their own person anymore just some identical clone to you
either way it wouldnt be a fun relationship if you and them both were just so similar, the dynamic is what makes a bond strong
so dont go searching forever for the clone when you got good people in front of you

i agree, i don't think it'd be a fun relationship. my friends aren't exact clones of me either and i enjoy their companionship, still,there are always some traits in other people which put me off. maybe im too critical idk. its hard to shake the feeling that there might be someone like me out there, someone who thinks the same way i do

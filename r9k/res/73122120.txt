i unironically like reddit
Reddit is good for viddy games and porn.
Yeah it's alright, especially in the smaller subs where there's less censorship. The frontpage though is the most cancerous place on the internet, i would unironically rather use twitter.
Reddit is exactly as good as the subreddits you subscribe too. The website really took a turn for the worse with all the fake news and such a few years ago
When I google stuff now I will search something like "washing machine won't empty water repair reddit" and I will get 50 fucking threads of people with that problem and hundreds of autistic well researched replies with relevant anecdotes and good advice
Otherwise I will just get ads or crappy forum posts from 15 years ago with outdated or missing info
great, maybe you should go back there.

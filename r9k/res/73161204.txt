Do you consider using a walkthrough guide 'cheating'
<comment>
between 9 and 14 i always used bradyguides and always begged my parents to buy them for me, because theres no fucking way in hell i would ever find evrey single heart piece in OOT or majoras mask, or every small thing in every game i played. just no way
its just information, its not skill. i dont respect "finding clues" as a skill. i suck at it, and have no wish to be good at it. i always hated puzzles
<comment>
Honestly? No. I've had a fair few times I had difficulty figuring out a favourite girls route on vanilla visual novels or true endings on games that had em, so unless you're opening them and just play the game looking at them instead of actually playing through the game and enjoying them, they're ok.
<comment>
no because terraria is impossible without it
<comment>
I only use them if I'm stuck or exhausted all other methods
<comment>
Nah even before I didn't use them
Now I use them because introducing blundy running simulator moments that stretch out for hours isn't gameplay, it's a crutch to stretch out gameplay time
<comment>
Absolutely. You didn't beat the game if you used one. I do make an exception for sandbox games like minecraft or terraria though.

I don't see single-player games as a competition, so 
the concept of 'cheating' doesn't really apply. It's an arbitrary challenge I'm putting in front of myself because it's fun. If it's no longer fun, one thing I can do instead of giving up is go look for tips to either help
find the fun or get me past this part so it's fun again. 
I do generally take quite a bit of time before 'resorting' to a guide, but that's because 
in the case of something like a Souls-like boss fight, I genuinely enjoy the deductive process of "okay how does this work and how could I do it better" and the incremental little scraps of progress from doing a bit better every time, and for a puzzle that feels thoughtful and not 
just thrown in to kill time or hide a super secret chocolatey special ending, there should be enough clues and things to experiment with that I can 
have a decent time messing around and mulling them over 
waiting for that flash of insight.

You didn't beat the game
good, they're for faggot manchildren save the actually challenging elements where guides don't help
<comment>
There is nothing more faggoty and manchildish than arguing with me about this on this very special oriential animation website.

If i want to 100% a game and i don't want to sink time in it i will just use it, aswell when the game is story driven and i don't care about the gameplay that much
<comment>
Only if you use the walkthrough before at least trying without it. If I'm stuck on a certain puzzle or boss fight I'll keep going until I get pissed off and only then will I resort to the walkthrough. If I'm after 100% completion I won't use walkthroughs to find collectibles until after I beat the main storyline. I explore a lot just when I'm normally playing so I usually have 70-80% of the collectibles by the time I beat the game anyways.
<comment>
Yes but I also don't care
<comment>
I'm starting to get to the age where I don't really want to waste a bunch of hours being lost in a game, so no.
<comment>
For puzzle games, yes
<comment>
Who cares. All that matters is that you're having fun.
<comment>
When I was a child, my parents could beat Myst, and I could not. I was not mentally developed enough to beat it.
I beat Myst III a few months ago with no guide. It felt like a milestone for me.
<comment>
I don't care lmao
originole
<comment>
I did the crazy 4chan captcha and broke the /r9k/ rules just to tell you that I don't care
You will be made to care. You will SUFFER
<comment>
Projecting kekeke
<comment>
The only thing that I'm projecting is SUFFER using my words onto your soul
<comment>
I have no idea how kids today would need a walkthrough for anything when the stupid "achievements" they started adding into games in gen VII are basically an handholding system built into every game.
<comment>
Yes and no. I only use it when I'm really stuck and can't be arsed to try for 1-2h.
<comment>
i consider it wasting a completely perfect experience
the biggest fun factor in games is discovering shit for yourself
i look back to ton of games with fondness, even if they werent that great objectively speaking
for me they are the best, because i was still a kid and discovering shit in those games was mindblowing for me
i still didnt have set expectations, couldnt predict almost everything in a story, because it was all new
using a guide to rid myself of the sense of discovery and mystery would be a disservice to myself
using a guide is retarded, unless you really dont care about playing
<comment>
You wouldn't be saying it you were running like headless chicken around Dark Soul corridors infected by a parasite sucking up half the level up points with no cure you know of.
<comment>
I had, still have, a bunch of pokemon guidebooks from 2005-2011, and they are probably what helped me come to know the games so well. I also have one or two of those book fair gaming cheat code books somewhere in the basement, kids today will never experience button cheat codes and I feel pity for them.

I think it's Tier 1 Cheating.
Cheat codes and exploiting glitches are Tier 2.
Using a trainer or a similar cheat app is Tier 3.
Editing game assets is Tier 4.
Editing the game itself (with a hex editor for example) is Tier 5.
So yeah, walkthroughs are cheating, but they're the mildest form of cheating.
<comment>
nah, walkthroughs are fine for the most part

Am I manwhore if my body count is 8, but I've still never had a gf?
<comment>
there is no such thing as a "manwhore" dont use simp language. 
a man who sleeps with a lot of women is called a stud or player.

Why do you have sex without dating?
<comment>
because its what women have established as the dating market now, casual sex for chad so thats what all other men are obligated to aspire to.

Does this still apply if the women were low-tier? 
Why do you have sex without dating?
Rarely find a woman with gf potential and even when I do I fumble the bag or she rejects me. Have little difficulty establishing fwb type relationships though.

No, you slept with 8 whores

it always applies. low-tier women aren't any less picky than other women, especially under 30. they only become less picky around 30 when they realize chad isn't going to date and marry them.

I find the idea of sticking my dick in someone I don't at least like repulsive so yes you are whoring and lowering yourself

In the logic of nature, no. Men can produce shit ton of sperm to make shit ton of kids, it's not men's job to be selective in sex. Women has limited number of eggs, suitable age and stuck 8 months, if she is fucking someone who is not interested in a long term relationship to take care of the kid, she is prioritizing short term hornieness for long term loss, doing something irrational, she a whore.
But we don't live in caves anymore, fucking doesn't necessarily risk having kids, so that logic doesn't apply. We live in a society where relationships of this type are suppose to be about companionship, honesty and love and there are infinite free porn for anyone to coom as necessary but we don't have open polyamorous social expectation that separates sex from relationship. So sex not for the initiation of love realtionship is a waste of time for both for something they both want long term, both is doing something irraltional, she a whore, you a manwhore.

8 whores
Meh probably. Never slept with a virgin that's for sure. Don't really care. I wanted pussy. They wanted dick. Fair trade.
it always applies
Idk man, I just don't feel proud about sleeping with fat or ugly chicks.
I don't at least like
I did like them, just not in a romantic manner.
lowering yourself
Does this really even matter?
I've never slept with a woman that I also went on a date with. 
Haha that's a very silly frog. I like frogs.

Thats a pretty big leap in logic.
In this day and age where men and women are 'equal' socially, and there is so little risk involved (birth control, STI testing and treatment), the act has lost its meaning as something two people who have complete trust in each other or are doing it to obtain a goal, its now an activity two or more people can do that requires only a small amount of vulnrability, rather than trusting the person hasn't slept around. Like any activity two or more people can do it has a certain value and attributes to those two people.
I personally think like you, it should be done between two people who have a great deal of emotional investment in one another, but given the much lower risks with it, both biologically and socially, its not unreasonable for some people to treat it like a date, or an alternative to a fun day out.

doesn't really matter. my friend has a bodycount of 7 i think. got his virgin aspie wife. good things don't necessarily come to good people (at least prior to the after life).

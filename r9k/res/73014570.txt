In this thread, we talk about FemaleDatingStrategy's most hated topic: WOMEN PROPOSING.
People think that women proposing to men is on the rise. Some quick Googling seems to suggest that it is. I wasn't able to find truly hardcore stats on this with tables and cross tabs and everything, but the company ChiliSauce claims the women-proposing rate went from 5% in 2010 to 16% today.

Anyway, I'll kick of this thread with some questions, a different set for men and women. You don't need to answer these to participate in the thread, they're just conversation starters. Before I get into the questions I have to define the word 'propose.'
I'm counting any clear unambiguous request to marry as a 'proposal,' it does not have to be the traditional production with an engagement ring and the words do not have to be 'will you marry me?' but it has to be a clear and decisive ask where the only possible answers are 'yes' or 'no.' Vaguely nagging someone to marry you doesn't count.
MEN:
Has a woman ever proposed to you? If no, how would you react if a woman proposed to you?
Do you think women proposing to men is OK or not OK? State your reasoning.
What about other unconventional/modern marriage trends? Would you, for example, take your wife's last name if she wanted you to?
WOMEN:
Have you ever proposed to a man? If no, would you?
Do you think women proposing to men is OK or not OK? State your reasoning.
What about other unconventional/modern marriage trends like men taking their wives' last names?

nope, I'd rather die as a lonely cat lady.
Do you think women proposing to men is OK or not OK? State your reasoning.
other people can do what they want, although I don't personally care for it.
What about other unconventional/modern marriage trends like men taking their wives' last names?
I think it's best that a couple takes the cooler/better-sounding surname. I for example would likely take a future husband's last name if it was shorter than mine, because I already have a long first name, and I hate having such a long surname along with it.

I mean why would you say yes to that? That's like I hope I told you my nickname when I was out of town. You're charming but I'm not charming enough to stick around that long. Unless your dtf next time we run into one another like I don't travel that much 5-20 years? If they're asking I need to leave town maybe high ball this estimate.

I don't understand this comment.

As a man yeah I'd take my wife's name if it were objectively better than mine, which is pretty likely because my surname is really bad.
Don't see what you're going for but thanks for the (you)

If no, would you?

Do you think women proposing to men is OK or not OK? State your reasoning.
its kinda cute but its also pathetic. but then, i am pathetic so it doesnt matter :) 
What about other unconventional/modern marriage trends like men taking their wives' last names?
no, women should do everything for the man and take his name and be his quiverfull bangmaid handmaiden, especially if hes nyeongie &lt;3

loooool

It's implied you're suppose to ask them to marry. By that time you're probably got a drug addiction and other girls to see. They already had cold toes and you find someone else to dance with.

presumeably if you're going to marry someone, its because you feel love for them and want to spend the rest of your life with them
and the statistics on marriage, even worse on women proposing to males, surely cannot be virginal women. surely they have to be used up roastie whores
and if thats the case, why would anyone agree to that, or want to spend time with that?
im not a cuckold

That seems not the common female view on this when you check cheating/divorce rates and instigator

Has a woman ever proposed to you? If no, how would you react if a woman proposed to you?
No. I'm assuming we've been in a relationship for a number of years. I'd be flattered but also feel a bit put on the spot and maybe rushed.
Do you think women proposing to men is OK or not OK? State your reasoning.
Yes. Reasoning: people can do whatever the fuck they want. Also, I would personally like it, assuming I was already decided about wanting marriage.
What about other unconventional/modern marriage trends? Would you, for example, take your wife's last name if she wanted you to?
I would not take her last name. However, I would understand if she didn't want to take mine, and it would seem hypocritical to me to insist on it. I don't like hyphenated names, but I would accept each of us keeping our original surnames.

I swear I saw some psychotic tranny write a similar thing on lolcow. Blaine, is that you?

If she were a good woman, attractive, and a virgin I'd likely be asking before the year is up. If she's not all three of these things then I'd be offended she thought I would even consider marrying her in the first place. As a practice gf she should know her place and be happy with whatever of my time she is given. It's really that simple. Women should not propose or talk about marriage directly. Discussing future kids names or about future life together and implies marriage which is fine, cute even, but again only if she meets the three minimum requirements for her to be considered wife material. A man leads and woman follows.

Has a woman ever proposed to you? If no, how would you react if a woman proposed to you?
No, and i would tell her no but before she can respond tell her that im the man and i will propose to her. Im not rejecting marrying her, im rejecting her being the one to ask
Do you think women proposing to men is OK or not OK? State your reasoning
I think its ok, i just dont want it for myself. Similar to homosexuality, other people can like it and do it but i dont want it
What about other unconventional/modern marriage trends? Would you, for example, take your wife's last name if she wanted you to
I cant think of any unconventional things, and i wouldnt take her last name

LOL. haHAHAHAHAHAH. the fact that theres some deranged tranny who has the same mentality and same shitposting mindset out there as me, is actually hilarious on some existential level
lol

I'm SORT OF DOUBTING the sincerity of this comment!
No. I'm assuming we've been in a relationship for a number of years. I'd be flattered but also feel a bit put on the spot and maybe rushed.
This is somewhat similar to how I'd react I feel like I'd panic a bit,
Women should not propose or talk about marriage directly.
What do you think about women nagging men to marry them? That seems pretty common and I feel like, I dunno, what's the point of proposing if you've been nagged into doing it? It's like formally doing the proposal after being nagged is kind of lying: in any meaningful sense, she asked, not you; you're just putting on a performance.

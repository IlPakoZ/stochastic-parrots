That face has been put through a filter kek
I dread to think what he really looks like
<comment>
I remember the first time I saw this I thought it was women who had dicks surgically attached. Some kid at school straight up admitted being into shemales and showed us pictures. We were too confused to call him gay despite it being 2007
<comment>
filter is minor that's mostly ffs and makeup lad
<comment>
I am a wank from home chad also. Truly is the life to live.
While I am a full-on gooner I do think the lad spamming the thread could chill out a bit; images should be reserved for general apu posting, posts of note that benefit from a pic or choicely selected gooner/coomer posts e.g. the GOON MORNING guy and Footlad.

Does anyone have those drawn pics of Moni where his nose is getting bigger and bigger like a pokemon evolving? Was scouring through me folders the other day but couldn't see them. They were peak content.

Nah he was sound, just a bit dim. I think anon lads bring out the worst in people though by trying to rile up people like him.

<comment>
Holy shit, flid just got doxxed.
I thought it was foot lid, didn't realise it's because of his mental deformity.
<comment>
Does anyone have that pic of SSM holding a hammer to the camera? It must be quite old because he still has a decent hairline

Why the mask? Why the mentally ill trannies and feminists?

F1nn will never do actual lewds, lad, don't hold your breath. I looked at a free version of his onlyfans and holy shit it's disappointing. It's literally just the same tame stuff he posts for free on his twitter but with a few extra shots and some bulges here and there. 
Who the fuck pays for that crap?

HAHAHAHAHAAH ENJOY YOUR SOGGY CHIPS YOU FUCKING FAGGOT. I was just baiting to get you to reveal how sad and pathetic you must've been to give up your hard-toiled wagie cash to some paki peddling his goyslop only for it to arrive soaked in sugar-water and half of it to not be there.
<comment>
I keep getting asked why I don't have an onlyfans and the reason is because the only goods to show is my dick and I'm not into that. F1nn doesn't even have breasts so all he can do is just be another naked twink jerking off on camera.
<comment>
Same with Camii. Nothing worse seeing on her OnlyFans. If I'm going to simp for a trap I want to see them wanking and nutting

you've unironically done him, lad, he DOES seem sad and pathetic now
<comment>
Samefag changing his posting style
Sad!
<comment>
Totally lame and pathetic. If you're on OnlyFans then make it worth while i.e. put out regular decent ACTUAL porn. I cannot stand the crop of OF creators who think that it's just a money tap that they don't have to work for. So lazy and lame. Just make porn ffs.
<comment>

If you ran outside the house naked and kept going, how long would it take for your enjoyment to be brought to an end? I'm guessing it would be twenty minutes for me as I live in an urban area.

does ruthmong really work as a night watchman?
<comment>
Ruth took down 1 more video recently. Wonder why.
<comment>
No I'm a full time neet with no gf. There's no point working if you can't get love.
<comment>
I'm busy gooning, lad. I'm not some sad cunt who stays in britfeel all day constantly refreshing to see if someone responds to me.
<comment>
Ruth's from York (one of the best cities to live in).
<comment>
Ruth took down 1 more video recently
It not right
<comment>
You're obsessed with black willies. Stop fooling yourself with pretending to find these ethots attractive.
<comment>
That isn't Ruthposter. He doesn't type in lowercase
<comment>
Real shame Ruth has to take down videos and YouTube can fuck off with its AI moderation.
I rememeber the one where she said she was going to Scotland. Some little simp commented and said be aware of creeps and then it got deleted. That was a good one too. I have got it still.

Why would a woman want a man with no money
You'll never get a gf without a job lad
<comment>
Why would a woman want some man working at a warehouse for peanuts? Your job defines you. Girls perceive you as boring if you aren't doing an exciting job. It's best to just stick with being neet if you are no better off with relationships.
<comment>
Fuck off Footmong
<comment>
it's best to just do nothing and stay miserable
<comment>
Moin 
New side character?
<comment>
Life shouldn't be defined by relationships people will say. A lot of men would drop out of working if they weren't getting relationships though. They couldn't cope slaving knowing they are not going to be loved. Being incel should be a valid reason for getting disabilitybuxx. It fucks you up mentally.
<comment>
Closerlad didn't even finish the last thread for us
Lazy!
<comment>
I'm going to be miserable working anyway. I'll have more money but not love. I really don't care about buying nice things or going places when I can't find love. Mind you I couldn't go anywhere anyway on a minimum wage slave job.

The Scotland video she did have quite a noticeable wonky eye. she may have felt insecure about it even though no lad would care about that. that's the only other explanation.
<comment>
A weak gimmick that rarely appears, unless you, who I'm guessing half arsed the gimmick, mentions it.
<comment>
Her dad has put the internet filter on the isp and her phone so she can't look at adult sites like this anymore.
<comment>
I'm actually the 'real' Closerlad but I couldn't be arsed to do it anymore. Proof attached I suppose.
<comment>
no penis
no tattoos
Ok I believe you
<comment>
soundspacker replied to me
Life is complete
<comment>
For a while there was a lad saying closerlad was in prison, as if he knew the lad. You know anything about that?
<comment>
At the end of the day she shouldn't stop her hobby when she has so many supportive people out there. It's not right and shows weakness. Trolls love that. I hope she gets back to making asmr regularly someday. She'd have 100k subscribers by now.
<comment>
When you getting drunk and scratching yourself? flid lad?
<comment>
Thank fucking GOD that we aren't speaking German, right?
<comment>
No idea, I haven't been posting regularly but haven't been to prison either so you can class that as utter bollocks.

A cute girl with a penis?

Kek, you done him Ruthlad
<comment>
The only scent I want is a females.
I'm not jealous. I was born male. There is nothing I can do about it. Females get love and support easily in every aspect of life. That's why female asmr is the most popular. You have other females who treat them like besties and lonely males who simply love the faux connection they have with them (often those who would be seen as unattractive irl).
<comment>
I literally would not care so long as they're cute and give good, sloppy head and give it enthusiastically.
<comment>
No I'm not. I'm a longterm neet because of being incel.

I am doing jury service but they said I'm on call and don't need to come in until I am called in. 
Does this mean I get to go back to work like normal on that days I'm not called in?
My employer just said I can go do jury service but nothing else

Ruth has 16k subscribers and does nothing. Meanwhile other asmr girls who post regularly are struggling to get more than 5k subscribers.

How retarded are you? Seriously.

If he can bag a girl a lot younger than him then why did he pick an ugly one?

She may be 36 but he is like twenty years older. That's the equivalent of me dating a 13yo.

It takes a special kind of girl to put up with an obnoxious slaphead like that. I'm sure she only is in it for his wealth.

Inside the Factory is propaganda to get more people working in warehouses and factories. They make it seem like so much fun doing repetitive shit all day. Someone's got to do it I suppose but automation thankfully will take over most of those jobs.

I don't like working. Its really tedious and feel like the low pay to effort is sucking my soul away.
Really wish I was rich so I wouldn't need to keep working. I'm tried of it and I'm 23 so it feels like its going to be forever before retirement and even getting a house in london feels like a pipe dream.

Become a neet especially if you can't get girlfriends.

I was a neet for 5 years prior and got a low wage IT job after trying many times. 
I can't become neet since I live alone and wouldn't be able to pay rent on just what the government gives me and my future will be even worse.
It feels trapped and seriously a money issue that can only save me from working and the pressure of it

People in /brit/ say that London is bad, but I think it's great. Pic related is why it's great.

lads all alone and feeling gay

I went through a similar thing around your age. Also work in IT but 10 years older. It's a bitter pill to swallow but it gets easier as you progress and each time you get a raise you become more entrenched but slightly less miserable for a short period. I'm on 45k now and it's nice to be able to buy anything I want without worrying about it. You just get used to it, no advice other than keep on keeping on until the conditioning takes. Also I use a lot of drugs so that probably helps.

it is for gay men 
SAD!
<comment>
Cheers lad, good tune an all
<comment>
Check'd and I may have bitten off more than I can chew'd. 
The quality will probably be somewhere between, embarrassingly shit - kill yourself, that's shit. But we'll see what happens.

<comment>
That's nice, but I'd wait till the finished product.
This is it so far, and there's bits wrong, but I'll persevere.
<comment>
Fuck sake lads accidentally got a bit drunk and stoned. Well the stoned wasnt accidental but the drunk was. Got to be semi decent at work tomorrow. At least coworker is back from her holiday, takes the pressure off me a little bit. 
Need to eat some stodge to soak up the booze over the next 10 hours

I think it's not necessarily the images being spammed, it's just spamfag being an annoying faggot, regardless of what he's posting.
Also, it's definitely not 1 spammer, even though all spam has vanished. Not even 1 post of it.
What a sad cunt he is.
And you cunts are sadder, just allowing it, then fucking off as well. Rats from a drowning ship, springs to mind.
<comment>
Yeah sure, being a bitter 4chan shut-in is way better than getting with girls, right?
<comment>
This thread has hit image limit so here's a new thread

<comment>
It just redirected to Los Angeles LGBT centre. Bet they are well chuffed they got that domain
<comment>
Just checked and it redirects the 'Los Angeles LGBT center'

That domain is probably worth 100k easily
<comment>

He's spamming the thread and trolling the catalogue by constantly making new threads when there's no need, just so he can keep spamming.
Jannies don't care, but shouldn't stop you reporting it.
<comment>
Sim day and night?
<comment>
Its really baffling. I remember posting a single BBC pic in /britfeel/ a few years ago and was banned for 3 days
<comment>
There's a couple I know that have a child ok the way, they seem so immature though. Wonder how that'll pan out, they both watch anime all day
<comment>
I would say 75% of the time I post a soijak I get banned for it, occasionally a warning if I'm lucky
Used to have a lot of respect for the janny and would always serve bans rather than reset the router, but if this shit is allowed to pass Shan't be doing that in the future
<comment>
The trick is to just stay in this thread now that the coomer mong can't post filth.
<comment>
Whsat ISP are you on that allows router reset to change IP?

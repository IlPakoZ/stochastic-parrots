Fetishes seem to be common among the browsers of /r9k/, and I imagine most of these people have some sort of gripe with said kink.

your fetish
ABDL/MDLB.
how long you've had it
Since age four.
where it came from (if you know)
My mom kept me in diapers and fed me baby bottles until he came back when I was supposed to start kindergarten soon and he was mad as fuck. I got rushed through potty training and I guess in a way it was traumatic. I was already fond of the sensations of wearing and didn't want to stop, but with how quickly I had to, it became something I would just dream about throughout my childhood. Two years later I would get struck off my bicycle by some teens with a baseball bat and they tried to blind me with a laser pen. They would stone me, push me around, taunt me, threaten to kill me, etc. every time I stepped outside. I was harassed in school and didn't make my first friend until I was 15. So I became a shut-in at age eight and wanted nothing more than to regress and stay little forever, and it's never changed other than wishing I was aborted instead. The outside world sucks and I would like to forget everything that happened. Pretty much every experience I've ever had outside has been shitty.
why you're attracted to it (if you know)
Baby powder and the scent they put in Pampers is the most wonderful and soothing. Also diapers just feel great, soft and hug you tight. And it feels amazing when they're wet and warm. I yearn for a mommy gf to soothe my butthurt and fix me but I guess that's never happening.
has this fetish made your life harder
Yeah, when I was seven or so years old, there was an episode of Maury or Jerry Springer or something and some asshole LARP'd about being ABDL and they filmed a cringe af video. I was there with my family and I remember them laughing and being completely disgusted, so I knew I had to keep it a secret from them and I hated myself for about ~15 years as a result. I no longer hate myself for it but I hate that I've been cursed with it and will die alone.
if you could get rid of it, would you?
Absolutely. I wish I was a normie.

Tfw maxed out character limit
Wanted to add: I hate that I'm going to die alone because of it because practically all women find it repulsive and the mommy gf thing is meme tier and you have better chances of winning a lottery if you're not gigachad.

No woman damaged enough to want to be a mommy gf would want chad, they want perfect femboys that look like they have filters on irl. 
Your best bet is to forget about your fetish and move on, or disassociate as best you can. For my cuck fetish I huff copium and say im not me when im horny. Lets me feel normal

I'll give this thread a bump, undecided as to whether I want to post mine.

your fetish
Petplay (Dominating), slaveplay (Dominating), bimbofication, ropeplay
how long you've had it
Probably around 17ish
where it came from (if you know)
Since coming out of my shell, I've always had an enjoyment of leading, being in charge, and being a point of authority. I also love the idea of having an obedient pet that I can "Play" with whenever I want.
why you're attracted to it (if you know)
Basically above. I get great enjoyment of being a respected person in what I do. Be it at work, in the home or in bed. I tend to be the decision maker in my friend groups when everyone is indecisive and I've always gotten respect for this mentality 
has this fetish made your life harder
Nope, if anything it's had the opposite effect and has allowed me to always get into positions of leadership in my professional life
if you could get rid of it, would you?
Not in a million years.

hypnosis
forever
either cartoons influenced me or it was a girl that used to babysit and hypnotize me/let me hypnotize her
No idea why I like it, you'd think it's the control but no I'm into the actual process of hypnotizing rather than the result of it.
life is harder in the sense that I require this to be satisfied yet try to keep it hidden because I have a mostly non-degenerate inner circle. Thankfully submissive girls are usually into it as a kink if I bring it up.
I would only want it gone if I was never able to live it out in any way, since I'm in a pretty good situation with it now though nah, 5 years ago? maybe

God I wish there were guys with this kink in my country

your fetish
Gentle femdom 
how long you've had it
Since I was a kid 
where it came from (if you know) 
Negligent/absent mom 
why you're attracted to it (if you know) 
Makes me happy 
has this fetish made your life harder 
Yes, the ratio of dom women:sub men is 5:1, not to mention many dom women are psychos who want to peg you. Also you 'compete' with a lot of pathetic guys who will work fulltime, do all the chores etc. just to have sub/dom sex for 30 mins a day. 
if you could get rid of it, would you?
Probably yes, but at the same time it doesn't really bother me. Getting this fetish was mostly outside of my control, and I don't think I have much power to change it, so I just accept it.

Not true. I had a mommy gf and I cucked myself out of the relationship because I hesitated too much to meet her since I was given a false impression that taking a trip would be more costly than it actually is. She didn't want to come to me, so I had to go to her and it made me uncomfortable, even more so because she didn't want me to stay with her at her parents home which meant more expenses. I'm morbidly obese and she liked that. She didn't like when I started losing weight and in fact wanted the opposite, she has no interest in femboys. But she got tired of the distance and left me for a chad. She used to lurk here. My one shot at making it and I wasted it. Welp.

It's pretty common nowadays, I'm sure there are and you just aren't trying to find them.

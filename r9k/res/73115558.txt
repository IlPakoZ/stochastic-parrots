My therapist (female) and me are going over the triggers for my depressive phases currently. I've been going to her for a few weeks now. We never talked about sex because i feel like that would be a really bad decision (incels are looked down upon, even harder than autists). So my question to the real robots here: Is it smart to talk about how lonely you are and how much you long for sex with the other gender or should i avoid it?
You should avoid it along with women more generally. Your therapist probably hates you
are you going privately? how much you're paying? how muc do you know about her, how did you find her?
your therapist probably wants to fuck you after you sperg how much of a whiny bitch you are

I lost a friend a while back ago. It was my fault and I've done things I regret. I moved on and talk to my other friends and they've helped me with it, but sometimes they still pop into my head. I want to try and message them, but I promised I'd be outta their life for good. 
I don't really need advice since it just needs time to heal, but I just felt like sharing this.

<comment>

<comment>
they don't know what you look like.
anon...the summons is for me to show up in person.
<comment>
Start ranting to the judge about how you despise crackers.
<comment>
i guess i can try that but i dont think people care as much about black people who are racist against white people vs the other way around. ive even seen black people say black people cant be racist which is absolutely not true
<comment>
Just tell them you feel biased towards one of em and they won't call you back.

I got summoned in March last year, here's how it went:
everyone who got summoned wet up at a VFW hall
as the day went on, we would wait to hear the results of cases to see who was needed
the hall could fit a few hundred people, at least 100 others were waiting in the hall with me
got there around 8am
they began playing some NPC movie on a projector around 8:30 in the downtime
the hours began to go by, and one movie went into another
around noon, after no word since 9am, we got an update
all the cases of the day resulted in not requiring a jury
everyone was sent home, along with $10 or so for compensation
I'm now exempt from jury duty for three more years without having actually served
Maybe you'll have a good ending like I did.

That's what you get for being a normalfag and registering to vote. That's how they pick people for jury duty. I've never been picked for jury duty because I'm not registered.
<comment>
My impression is that they want upper middle aged tv news watchers, like your mom, as jurors, not younger individualistic minded people.
<comment>
have fun going through life without ever having any of these
<comment>
if i ever get jury summoned i might just flat out say
i don't feel comfortable being on the radar of a potential criminal who lives in the same district as i do
$10 or so for compensation
that's just insulting
<comment>
whats so bad about jury duty? 
why not just do it OP?
<comment>
Look up Jury Nullification.

caring about jury duty
I've been summoned about three times now and it just seemed inconvenient each time 
first time, notice arrived in mail mark down I;m a college student, send proof of enrollment, dismissed 
second and third time, get notices in the mail fill out online applications for jury duty get juror candidate number and was told to not go the court house unless summoned on line or by phone. For the second time I was told to wait and check the website once a day for the whole week, for the third time it was a period of two weeks. Both times the candidate pools were about 500+ people so chance of being picked were pretty slim, was not picked both times and was paid 5 dollars each jury duty. So in the end I lost three weeks of work and got paid 10 dollars for my "service".

Just tell'em you hate honkys, chinks and spics they'll let you right off if you get picked that is.

I was never given that option. Before this they just sent a survey basically asking me to confirm my address and phone number.

Go to their website, enter your juror id #, it will have all your info, find the exclusion page, pick an excuse why you can't serve or enter your own like the anon said about moving. They will email you saying you've been excused, save that email. It's so easy to get out of.
<comment>
ive gotten 3 of those. the night before i was supposed to show up id call the number and every single time the automated message said my services were no longer required. youll probably get that. if you dont show up its at worst a bench warrant which is low priority and no one cares about it

Pull an Uncle Ruckus No Relation
<comment>
They didn't give you a website on the notice?
<comment>
im on the website and dont see any place to enter my juror # or any info really.
<comment>
It might be under the "complete your questionnaire"
tab

I've been called for jury duty like 5 times now. Never served though
Was a student for the two times
Next two, checked and was never asked to come in
Last time was right when Covid hit so they cancelled all court cases for a couple weeks, so I didn't have to do shit
Lucked out, but fuck, I get called a lot.

I got 2 for 2 different courthouses last December. Most places you call ahead a couple days in advance and they have a recorded message telling you if you'll even have to show up that day, sometimes they don't even have any trials scheduled so they say you're done and won't bother you again for at least a year, got off the hook for both of them that way. My first one like 8 years ago I wasn't so lucky, had to show up in person and go through the entirety of voir dire just to be dismissed by prosecution for being a sperg at the very end.
Snobby faggots will say "heh the only people that can't get out of it are too dumb to get out of it", but do you really want to chance being that guy the judge sends out a bench warrant for just because he's feeling petty that day and get dragged in?
Most people get picked up for it when they get a driving license.

I had a jury duty summons last year, told them I wouldn't be able to be unbiased since the case was about some guy litigating for pain and suffering against some large hotel chain. I didn't get picked but I also got lucky since it was right before the day ended so there was no chance to stick me into another room. The judge was also thankfully not present or else they would've done something to scare me into changing my mind. Either way, you can try what I did if you get picked late but I don't know what to tell you if you get picked early. You could also lie and say you have family that are police officers are or friends with people in law enforcement.

Oh and if you can postpone it, do it till late December since you should be able to pick your day in NY. Absolutely don't pick anything for early January.

Daily reminder that you can use the Big Five to "hack" your personality and make it align more with what women find attractive.
The ideal male personality would be:
Very High in Extroversion
Low in Openness to Experience
Low in Agreeableness
High in Conscientiousness
Very Low in Neuroticism
Is this you? If not, use behavioral adjustment until it is you.

Women like all types of guys, the only one that very consistently checks out is low in neuroticism, but even high neuroticism can work if the guy is pathetic enough and the girl has a power fetish over him

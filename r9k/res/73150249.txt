God sucks and heaven is boring.
How do I create a religion ?
What are some fundamentals every religion has ?
I'd write canonical and apocryphal books if I have to.
But you already are a god Haruhi
religion is social engineering and used for riches desu
your religion will not succeed if you are not a merchant in the first place
it's a png retard
I'll make it so you only need one person in the afterlife to believe in it for it to exist. I'm not looking to make a cult
a religion has benefits in any government tho
Do what Mohammed did with the bible and create a new book from the Qur'an and whatever loopholes it provides for a new prophet.
Why not join the religion of Mitama? Right now every new follower gets a FREE combine!
Yeah but my religion will get twisted in no time soon after my passing.
I guess basing it on existing biblical books would help with the writing yeah. Though I'm sure there's more that goes into it than religious texts.
I'll steal the combine idea.

I feel like I should stop playing videogames. I increasingly feel like its a real pathetic loser hobby.
Most videogames are designed to try and get you as addicted as possible, and at the end of it what do you have to show for yourself?
I know people who play 12+ hours a day and get nowhere near the top ranks on games. Why are they wasting away their life like this?
I feel like Ive wasted my whole life with this dumb hobby. I could have spent that time playing sports, making friends etc. My school had so many extra-curricular activities and yet I would just go home everyday and play videogames till bed. It was such wasted time.

I only play single player games, I like good stories

I'd recommend playing older games, they have actual soul. Recently I picked up this cool game for the Wii called "Murasama The Demon Blade." I'd highly recommend it. Alternatively theres some good ones for pc too, I'd personally recommend the Yakuza series (start from Yakuza 0)
90% of modern AAA games are dogshit cashgrabs made for normies to waste their mony on. If you really insist on playing a modern game though, then I'd suggest Deep Rock Galactic or Don't Starve Together. If you don't like multiplayer though theres a few neat single player games but they are mostly indies. (Pizza Tower, Ultrashill, Scorgebringer, etc)
Also, No Mans Sky is a nice Minecraft clone if youre into chill vibes and building.
Eitherway anon, I understand the feeling all too well. When I'm not gaming however I've taken up programming as a hobby. Mabye someday I'l be able to make some indieslop of my own lol. Video games dont have to be your only hobby, you can do whatever else youre interested in.

Most young people waste their time on dumb shit. As long as you don't take the habit into your 30s

Not cool enough for you to remember the title, apparently. Yakuza is a one and done series, same map, same gameplay, same game over and over again.
Not a soul posting on this trashheap board has the room to talk about how anyone else spends their time.

No, that is literally the games title.
And although I will agree Yakuza is pretty one and done, at least its still better than most shit coming out these days

It's Muramasa.

I like video games that force you to get better. What else would you be doing? Lifting weights and learning another language? Picking up overtime? If you can limit your video game to a few hours a day, there is nothing wrong with it.

Then stop playing them.

I feel the same way
I did extracurriculars and stuff outside, I had a lot of hobbies over the years, but I would always come back to video games. I've spent more time playing video games than anything else. By the time my dad was my age, he had practically explored the entire US and had a dozen different jobs, had sex with women all over the world, learned life skills and had stories to tell for ages. All I have are multikills and rare items on a database that is actively trying to extract money from me. It is a loser hobby because we aren't living real life. We are losers

Everything is stupid and meaningless, if you had fun it was worth it

How different are videogames than normal card games or stuff like that?
as long as you have free time you're allowed to do anything

They're fine with friends. Everything becomes dumb and soulless once you do it alone

I feel like I should stop playing videogames blah blah blah
What are you 12? Of course video games are stupid. It's escapism for autists by autists.
What grand plans do you have that require quitting them? I'm so eager to know. You're going to what...? Get in shape? Make friends? Fuck off. You'd have done those things years ago if you had the discipline but you don't. You can quit vidya, but you'll fill the hole with some other lazy shit and then come here whining to strangers about how that feels like a waste of time.
Your life will be a meaningless waste until they bury you if you don't develop some kind of self-discipline and work ethic. If you don't want to, just keep playing video games. They're a great way to fill the time between now and the big sleep.

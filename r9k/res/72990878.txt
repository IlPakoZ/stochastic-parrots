i sometimes really do feel like a dumb little child stuck in a world of real people and it makes me sad
im okay if i never do anything big, but not even being able to really have a life is very very sad
but video games make me smile and that means not everyone is evil and those people make stuff to make others have fun and be happy 
:D

Why can't you have a life?
You sound smart and well written to me.
I think you just have low self-esteem.

i was tested for 88iq and i barely managed to hold onto an average in school
im only lucky my family stands around upper middle class to even in the maybe rich in low millions depending on how the company is earning that year so i dont have to worry about stuff as much but i know i am a disappointment
but i do try my hardest

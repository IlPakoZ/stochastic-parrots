I just want someone to hold me and take care of me. I hate being alone

female? go on tinder
male? go on grindr

why are you giving this bad advice?
<comment>
I am feeling like this too. I just want some comfort and companionship. Each week is the same as the last and I am miserable. Life sucks.

False. Not true, anon.

a grindr hookup will be very likely to run straight out the door and block him immediately after cumming, this is apparently extremely common behavior on that app, getting actual affection as a gay guy is kinda hard

recently had a fantasy about bathing and taking care of a really depressed girl and working to help her feel better

its ok, you get used to it

for grindr true, but grindr is literally pretty much sex only. Like you don't go to McDonalds for a salad. 
There is gay dating apps for dating and not just sex. And I've been in a gay relationship since a long time. It's not hard.

if you had an online gf, how would you like her to surprise you or make you happy? for your birthday or randomly
<comment>
Send hot nudes.
That's it.
<comment>
what makes a nude hot?
<comment>
Literally this, maybe a joi. Women aren't capable of emotionally supporting men, so might as well make us coom, simple as
<comment>
those are such meaningless relationships, honestly
<comment>
With Habbo Presents. A poem also works but that's just me.
<comment>
admit it's not fully online just long distance and mostly online until the gf finishes studies and move in
ok but id like to be more than a sex toy kinda
cant you think of some other stuff
<comment>
Wear a fashionable bikini or lingerie.
I said it too simply. I don't want nudes necessarily; I want erotic pictures.
<comment>
show me hot lingerie or nice nudes
i need to be the bst erotic self photographer out there
<comment>
i'm actually thiking of ordering cute clothes
i usually dont care about my style at all but ever since i learnt my bf is visual (as all men i guess) it made me reconsider
<comment>
Pretty much this. Full stomach, empty balls, and silence are the 3 ways a girl can really make a man happy. And you can only really do 1 of those online
<comment>
kinda sad :-(

You can either give him what he really wants or give him what you want him to want, and he'll pretend to like it. This is why women are the vampiric sex, you somehow even manage to give gifts in a self serving way 
Exactly
<comment>
what are we going to do when once his balls are empty then
<comment>
this, mine went batshit insane over my bikini pic!
<comment>
ok..? why so mad
<comment>
what kinda bikini do guys like
should i just go for the most revealing out there?
<comment>
ok..? why so mad
Because I'm tired of how everyone and everything bends over backwards to accommodate women. You wouldn't understand or care to understand since you live on ezmode and want to keep it that way
<comment>
i suggest you find a woman irl like at your job or something and talk to it instead of basing yourself on videos you watch on the internet and your tinder experience
<comment>
Swing and a miss there foid, nice try though. Make sure the nudes are good, it's all you're good for ;)

while you're good for nothing, not even showing me what a nice nude looks like
you can leve my thread now
<comment>
Not gonna happen, I can rate your nudes ahead of time so your bf gets the best ones, you're probably too much of a scaredy cat though
<comment>
one day you'll find a nice gf to send u ones dont try stealing those of other ppl's girlfriends it's not very polite
<comment>
If you have my physical address then send me a letter. Don't let me know it's coming. Let it surprise me. I will keep your letter and treasure it forever.
<comment>
I'm just trying to help you better your relationship with your bf, ofc I won't do this for free. Besides, many anons have already pointed out this is the best gift, so you're getting more out of it than me
<comment>
I personally love microbikinis.
Would drive me insane too to see my crush in this.
<comment>
What if my bf isnt a coomer and feels utterly embarrassed of men with faced with coomer shit
<comment>
A plane ticket.
<comment>
If he is not physically aroused by you I would question that relationship.

Sounds like he's virtue signaling, are you openly liberal or feminist to him? Tons of supposedly liberal men just lie to get pussy
<comment>
he went super primal and territorial &lt;3 when i was wearing a skirted bikini, similar to this in a jewel tone
<comment>
He is aroused by me but he doesn't like that (being aroused) and coomer shit. He hates being associated with coomerbrains and with idea that all men are sex-crazed beasts, and he pretty much enjoys me being naturally modest and camera shy because his exes were regular whores and it utterly repulsed him. He is romantic and prefer to see me as adorable sweetheart rather than sex object. 
I am a secret misandrist but I dont show it to anybody, I think most of his friends are some libtards but I am not sure.

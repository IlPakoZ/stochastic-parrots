meanwhile, on the /r9k/ grand quest...
cleric (fem) is raped within the first turn 
the bard naturally kills himself with his basilet (nat 20)
archer and warrior have steamy gay sex after murdering the cleric and then eachother
would we really be that useless
meanwhile, on the /r9k/ grand quest...
I take off my robe and wizard hat
I will spread Islam among the Orcs
no r9k group to start a guild on some MMO and kill all the normies while doing fun quests together and harnessing the power of autism, virginity, and frens
I really hope Dragon's Dogma 2 has COOP. Exploring in a group of 4 would be perfect with the DD combat

lost my virginity to a rando from 4chan
never been on a date 
its over for me, i should've kmsed after doing it like i planned
<comment>
Oh noooooo send me your tag so you can tell me your life story. I will definitely listen
<comment>
This just happens doesn't it. Everyone just meeting up on 4chan, ON FUCKING 4CHAN and having sex and orgies. This is why Anonymous is bullshit and why we should just make this site into social media.
<comment>
It's just iris larping as someone else to get her fix of attention.
<comment>
well, soc is a board
im a different femanon
fix of attention 
no i'm just sad, i saw a video of men making fun of girls who were non virgin but never been on a date before
<comment>
I'm a slut, woe is me
Ungodly pathetic that this will hit 300 replies.
<comment>
I would feel sorry for you but I would definitely be one of those men laughing at you.
<comment>
yep
oh well, i will get over it, usually i care less about rver experiencing love
<comment>
That is sad OP, now you are in that limbo between not having enough purity value which make men looking for relationships to super desire you, and you are also not also slut enough to don't care and keep fucking and living that life of hookups.
<comment>
She's a slut but countless guys here would take someone far sluttier. You're a braindead pathetic simp. She just wants to attention whore and then also say she doesn't want a bf once 20 guys offer.

Alleynefag is Acaz (a BPD lolcow) , and he uses Alleyne as a guise for his innocent depressed elflover persona. In actuality, Alleynefag is a gay, alcoholic ERP fiend from the depths of /trash/, he also frequents /afgg/ on /vg/ where he found a guy called lain, paid for his plane ticket and allowed himself to be assfucked by lain, who instantly left after the act. Alleynefag is still spiteful about this and even leaked his address on /afgg/ (he did that today, literally).
He creates another thread persona with Holo from Spice and Wolf, and uses it to endlessly harass and insult Urabefag. Urabefag was (seemingly) close friends with Sayafag, and Alleynefag interpreted this as some hot gay love affair that he wasn't in on, so he got upset and used the Holofag persona to try and drive them away. He even said that he was "jealous of their chemistry".
He faked a suicide attempt during this, and even responded to himself (as Alleynefag) with the Holofag persona.
He eventually reveals being the person behind Holofag, then spends about year posting intermittently while focusing mostly on ERPing, alcohol and getting assfucked by strangers.
A few months later, some anon posts links to the vg archive where the whole assfucking thing is discussed. He comes here, attentionwhores more, then stops posting in waifu threads altogether. This happens like a year after the holofag thing, if my memory is right

it 100p is you iris, no need to lie. the people here for the most part know it's you. get off this board.
<comment>
im just going to remain alone and sexless, i guess even if i hadn't gone through with it id still never experince teen love, at least i experienced teen sex back while i still had any sex drive
<comment>
you make no sense, idek you
what does this have to do with anything?
<comment>
tfw ywn experience innocent love, first kiss under the school tree, first date, first romance without it being tainted by his disgust with you
<comment>
you can pretend all you want, lol. i know it's you because i spoke poorly before of iris in one of your threads and you lost your shit. claiming to be a good friend of hers that just happened to know a lot about iris in detail. now that is possible or more than likely the knee jerk reaction was because it was indeed you and felt attacked. get off this board, find people irl.
<comment>
i have no clue what you're talking about, nor do i care.
<comment>
woman sluts out
reeps consequences
Truly a tragedy.

lost my virginity to a rando from 4chan
Why?
<comment>
are you me? because same
i'm still not over it and i don't know why honestly
<comment>
whore gives herself some rationalization why she should be a whore 
cool
<comment>
cause i thought id kms soon after
it sucks, if only i wasn't so impatient and desperate. probably will never get over it desu
i don't think you understand my post, or just didn't read it through
<comment>
your retard femoid brain just wanted to hook up with someone plain and simple, the suicide plan was just some vague justification that was never gonna happen in the first place.
<comment>
kill yourself Keliyah O
<comment>
the circumstances were pretty sketchy, i think i did wanted to die
<comment>
keep playing ignorant, it's fine. you should still get out of this place, you are unwell.
<comment>
do you see the difference between want to die and genuine plan to die. now the justification changes to "i'm going to hook up with someone but it's ok because i'm depressed". you just sound bored
<comment>
Are you that black "femcel"?
<comment>
anon looks like this must be treated in therapy. along with whatever made you reach to that point. DBT therapy or any specialist in trauma recovery. looks like you have compulsions associated with past trauma. please take care of that and try not blaming yourself and of course not listening to all these insensitive motherfuckers. they think they won't be judged in the other world for what they have said online but they will be.
<comment>
hey think they won't be judged in the other world for what they have said online but they will be.

Kikuo femanon poster
It's unlucky the universe didn't allow us to meet.
<comment>
no, i had the plans and everything. i just was too pussy to go through with it
kek
why.. you mean so you could be the one to pump and dump?
<comment>
That's si_ku, not Kikuo's stuff.
<comment>
This isn't Iris, anon, this is the other femblackcel, the one who isn't as toxic and crazy (but is still an r9k poster, so, ya know)
Don't kill yourself, femblackcel, just go on a date with someone and hold their hand.
<comment>
why.. you mean so you could be the one to pump and dump?
No, to give you a novel kind of love and keep you close, aiming to build a better future for the both of us. I wouldn't want to lose my virginity to someone I will not continue to admire until the end. In that sense, I get where you're coming from.
You're right. I wasn't 100% sure~hazukashii

All good, Kikuo and si_ku worked together on a number of things so quite a bit of album art was done by her and Kikuo helped out with some of her songs too.
<comment>
Cool, just remembered how much I like Kikuo.
<comment>
Some of his newer songs are pretty nice too. There's also an album out there from him that I couldn't really find on google. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fBl9uvZtiU&amp;list=PLi5184-Z_QdAQlVTazRwuDXenMOlJ_pEz [Embed]
<comment>
Thanks, but I live in the past.
<comment>
Well, that old album is perfect for you then. Old, hard to find and of his older style. Either way, have a good one.
<comment>
you have two good ones.
<comment>
I think you place too much emphasis on the opinions of people who either don't matter or don't even exist. If you aren't fat and are willing to talk men, you'll automatically have a chance with anyone who doesn't have 6 feet, inches, or figures; you're fine.
<comment>
many such cases are recorded.
<comment>
you should be ashamed, thats disgusting

We're on 4chan. Tell everyone your secrets
I'll go first:
Sometimes I add things that things that benefit me to my regimen, but literally dont tell anyone else because they'll be faggots about it and say it wont work and kill my buzz

I just posted about this in another thread but one time I had just got up from the bathroom after putting on a new pad and felt I had to pee and didnt wanna go back downstairs so I just peed in my pad. I have never done a full blown pee again but sometimes ill let some trickle out if my pad is fresh and clean enough (I dont want it to mix with my period blood too much and had bloody piss on my underwear lol)

I only love my mom and my aunt. If my dad and little brothers died tomorrow I wouldn't shed a tear. I hate them that much. I pretend to be civil at family gatherings but I've hated them for a very long time
<comment>
I have some sort of weird fucking tic that makes me say "I hate myself" out loud multiple times a day. When I'm the presence of other people I just think it. I can't control it, it's like my subconscious screaming at me or something. Rationally I know I'm not a shit person but I can't break whatever the fuck this is.

I don't love my girlfriend. I just use her for sentimental confort. It is nice and cozy being with her. But at the same time her inmature mind and her dependency tells me she is by far not the one.
And I just wait until I finish my studies and go out of the country.
<comment>
I told myself this and now it's 8 years later and I'm with the same person
Are you going to have some practice kids with your practice gf too and have a practice life together and be buried side by side in practice graves
<comment>
I wish my grandma dies as soon as possible. But at the same time I am afraid I can't be with her when this happens. She has Alzies and she has stopped being her.
Also for my parents. Because I want to kms and don't want to make them suffer.
I am afraid my brother will end as a loser, who resents me for having "better luck"? In life.
<comment>
No practice anything. 
I am neutered.
I have to go to my country after some time here.
What excuses do you tell yourself when thinking about ending things?
<comment>
I mistrusts the few friend I have.
I just think they are my friends out of habit since we know each other since 15 years ago.
We share general broad things but not deep things and know they are more far away.
<comment>
Oh you HAVE to go to back your country makes sense it will end. Hope it's not messy for you 
I have nothing like that so momentum keeps us together. And the more we stay together the more our lived are entangled and the harder to separate
<comment>
I am so afraid of relationships that if I didn't have that exit plan I would just run of this shit.
But I understand you.
I was in the same situation before after almost 4 years. 
If you take advices, make something that change your life deeply, only true love survives that.

I have no secrets. Too boring for that.

I'm only with my girlfriend for financial reasons. I can't afford a single-bedroom apartment by myself with my wagie job, and with no degree it's about the best I can do. She is an insufferable womanchild who is so unstable any sort of frustration sets her off, she's a massive hoarder, and is getting fatter and has no sex drive due to her meds which stop her from having even bigger meltdowns. I've had to grin and bear it for 3 years now.
<comment>
If my bf wasnt asleep in bed right now I'd say he was writing this about me damn I need to get my act together
<comment>
That's rough. Does she contributes a lot to the financial situation?
What do you do together?
How do you manage her tantrums?
<comment>
How old are you two? Do you have plans on getting out of that situation?
<comment>
I'm letting my husband get a happy ending in Vegas. Can't tell the family
<comment>
Got a family with mom, noone knows our relation and just assumes a normal family which we appear and live as.

She pays half the rent and the electric bill. I could technically cover it myself, but it would be like 90% of what I make in a month, and landlords require you make 3x rent. When we have time together I have to sit with her and be moral support when she plays games she's bad at and gets overly frustrated eventually, and also watch shitty youtube videos with her where they regurgitate things found on reddit. We do also go out together almost weekly, have to make it seem like I put in some effort. I do all cooking, and she only pays for meals half the time. 
As far as her tantrums go, it's a matter of holding her and calming her down because otherwise she will slap and punch herself. She gets bitey sometimes. 
She's 30, I'm 32. I do have plans, but not a solid exit strategy yet. Breaking up with her and escaping unscathed is going to be a doozy, not to mention new working and living arrangements.
<comment>
Does she have autism or some sort of diagnosed mental illness? I'm kind of wondering how she's able to hold down a decent job but still flip shit over video games at age 30. Either way, sorry you got stuck with that.
<comment>
That's abhorrent and you're a tranny.
<comment>
Im actually a non-larping wizard (30 year old khv). I think other people know.
<comment>
I want to know your reasons. Why?
Just hand job or everything included?
Why not you?

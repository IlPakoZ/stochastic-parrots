I know someone that's so happy and nonchalant all the time. They seem so unaffected by anything around them and don't really have qualms with...
well, anything.
I'm trying to emulate them to no avail. I can't be the happy go lucky "I like anime tehee" cool friend that "just likes to game and have fun". How the fuck did this person achieve this level of inner peace.
<comment>
they are happy and nonchalant because the external circumstances beyond their control have given them an easy life on account of their genetics and luck of birth. it has nothing to do with inner effort/peace/strength/ideology. those are just post-hoc justworld copes.
<comment>
So basically, it's the
if you have to Try, it's already over
meme?
It's no fair. I want to be happy and unaffected by external factors too.
<comment>
just take what your friend has and switch places with them. simple as.
<comment>
You could try ignoring intrusive thoughts instead of indulging them. Other people are sad too they just don't make it their identity and try to enjoy their night.
<comment>
Not saying that you are entirely wrong but some people are built different and just don't give a shit about anything. They have no qualms living a monotone cookie cutter life while some people with much better lives kill themselves.
<comment>
no they aren't, they are just spoiled bitches. give me any of one of these faggy wimpy "built different" bitches and stick them in even a situation with just the tiniest amount of adversity, and they'll be "giving a shit" so fast your head will spin.
<comment>
nope, this is a justworld cope. people are sad or not in proportion to how spoiled they are. spoiled easy lives make people happy, hard rough morally righteous lives make people sad. happy people are thus morally decrepit and evil brats.
<comment>
it has to do with not taking yourself so seriously desu
<comment>
I would have agreed with you if i didn't know people like this. I knew a guy who was was stereotypical ugly nerd with no bitches but he still managed to have a social life and didn't mind being mocked. He is also doing much better than other folks I know while much better niggas ended up Hikkis.
<comment>
nope, happy people take themselves completely seriously and elevate themselves and their opinions above everything and everyone. 
sad people have to focus on others, do real work and effort, and by definition do not take themselves very seriously compared to happy people.
<comment>
if he didn't end up with a bad life it means he has no reason to be sad and is spoiled. that is exactly what im talking about. you are misreading him. it is a law of cause and effect, not an argument or discussion. if he is happy, he had an easy life. simple as.
<comment>
not minding being mocked is a cope. if he is a human being, he minds being mocked. there is no getting around it. pretending he doesn't mind externally is not the same thing as actually not minding.
<comment>
OP here, I forgot to add that the person I'm talking about is mega neuro typical. and I'm kinda spergy and depressed.
just stop being depressed
oh boy if I had a nickel...
<comment>
I mean he handled it better than other people. I would have definitely given hope on interacting with people if I was insulted that ruthlessly.
<comment>
neurotypicals hide their actual feelings because it is socially inappropriate to admit to being sad or depressed or in pain. His facade and what he projects or even admits, is not how he truly feels. In fact, if he is too consistently happy, it means he is terribly sad and depressed and is hiding it.
<comment>
No, he was internally depressed, and his internal state is literally his whole world Just because he projected happiness means nothing. A person only experiences whats inside their head, and there is no way to prove he was actually happy without brain scanning him 24/7 while he was being insulted.
<comment>
Maybe he did mind it but I still think he was a hard ass nigga who didn't become a shut in NEET,got a decent job and is still very active on social media with new set of "friends".
<comment>
active on social media
goes outside has job
not a neet
holy shit how do normies do this. so much energy. it's like they're powered by a cold fusion plant or something
<comment>
no, it has something to do with humility. and thereby NOT valuing yourself excessively highly against other people. it's understanding that everyone is basically the same and experiencing a similar version of the same journey. i'm not a very highly valued person and i pass almost every day in a state of detached amusement and nonchalance (not to overemphasize that, i still get stressed and annoyed like anyone else, but my default psychological profile at rest periods is just being calm and slightly smilingly indifferent and the averaged psychological profile of my day is chilling and not taking anything too seriously)
<comment>
This, the only people who are genuinely at peace are unironically lucky. They don't have ot be anxious because they don't have a history that would lend itself to anxiety.
<comment>
i used to be very anxious constantly to the point that i got diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and then it just kind of faded away when i started deliberately switching my mind towards trying to give people the benefit of the doubt and not view them as enemies
<comment>
most every other person you meet are more similar to you than you realize, i'm not gigachad and i don't enjoy an effortless life, it just makes you calm down to recognize that most people are on some level a hard time of things and to realize you're not the only one and they're not trying to jump down your throat
<comment>
I guaranfuckingtee he had excellent, loving parents and family then. So the point that anon made still stands. Give this "nerd" remotely bad parents and watch him slowly crumble under the weight of the biggest handicap there is: shit parenting.
<comment>
Here's the thing, they aren't really happy all the time. It's just a facade they put on.
<comment>
Well ofcourse if he had more handicaps then he would have broken but I was saying that people are objectively better than him and had similar parents/financial situation ended up in gutter while he is still going on. He looks like something you would see in incel memes and is short too. I just believe some people are built different. Just like how there are people who anhero because of mildest things there are also people who are content with what they have.
<comment>
I was going to give you actionable advice that worked for me as someone who was in your exact situation for most of my life, until you decided to shit on them for their appearance. I just love the whole sad anime girl posting and pretending to be an innocent depressed boy, then suddenly snapping and going into "HES SO UGLY AND SHORT AND DISGUSTING, WHY IS HE HAPPY??". Pure narcissism. Enjoy your misery I guess.
<comment>
found the bitter uggo lmao
<comment>
im not reading all this cope. the general rule is, the longer your post is, the more wrong you are. simple as.
<comment>
kek. real.
<comment>
You don't want to feel good, you want others to be just as miserable as you. Shitting on others for immutable, arbitrary characteristics immediately dispels your innocent sad animeposter persona. A non-evil person with depression would have said something like "I'm reasonably attractive so that's not the problem" instead of "&lt;happy person> looks like an incel meme and he's short LOL".
That immediate switch from sad lonely guy to cold sociopathy and desperate samefagging in defense of your big fragile narcissist makes me kek.
<comment>
not reading all that get a clue mald simp seeth touch grass
<comment>
big fragile narcissist
big fragile narcissist ego*
Kek you are an actual sociopathic normalfaggot larping as a depressed lonely guy. Did you think posting sad anime girls would distract people from your unrestrained narcissism? Glad to have ruined your little thread.
<comment>
still writing sentences i wont read
fewer words to be right, chop chop
<comment>
Hate these cunts so much desu. 9/10 times these threads are normalniggers looking for pity by larping as depressed outcasts.

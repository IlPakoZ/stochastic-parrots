Why do people celebrate birthdays? You are literally happy that you are 1 year closer to death/slow and painful, cancer-and-pain-ridden elderly life. Like, why? Outside of forced BDs during my childhood, I never celebrated mine once I was past 16teen. 
Friends got nothing to do with that. I have plenty of family members that nagged me about it, but after a few years they learned I give 0 shits.
Precisely that. Once you're an adult, you don't want more birthdays. You want to stay young. For most people, birthdays are just a reminder of getting older despite not wanting to.
So, as a society, we try to make it a good thing. We say "yes you're getting older, but hey, here's a day dedicated to you! Where those around you remind you of how much they love you. They shower you with gifts and affection. All so that you don't feel so bad. Happy birthday.". 
Everyone realizes this intuitively, except for people who suck at understanding social situations like you who probably are on the autism spectrum.
I celebrate surviving one more year, may not be a thing worth celebrating for you but, for some people surviving is real hard
My elderly life will be vastly better than most other people's because I'll maintain my health by eating food instead of poison

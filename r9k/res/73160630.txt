Anyone else a victim of soft parenting?
Yeah soft parenting is the worst
Yeah, it's made being an adult a living fucking hell. The kids who were athletes and socialable and didn't laser focus on only school with zero discipline in anything else like me are way ahead in life now. Depressing
100 percent. Both of my parents had legitimately psycho overbearing parents, and they swung way too far the other way, at least for me to not turn out as a piece of shit.
There's a lot I appreciate about the freedom and privacy that came with a near total "I'm going to be just non-specifically hands-off supportive as long as you seem to be happy and are keeping up with school" - however, ultimately, I probably could have benefitted a lot from some actual carrot-and-stick pressure to get out of the house, exercise, spend time on things that weren't TV or gaming, find a girlfriend... 
Yeah, I get that all of that's ultimately willpower and I will freely admit there was absolutely nothing stopping me from doing any of that, but also when you see a clearly smart but clearly lazy 12-year-old, I feel like it's also kind of on you as the parent to apply some pressure that's going to result in a well-rounded human being.

Not only did you lack the will to get out of the house, but your parents also lacked the will to discipline you. Perhaps you should have forced them to punish you for being shitty. Ever thought of that? But you didn't, and now pay the price.

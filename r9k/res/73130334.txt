What is the explanation behinds "cute penis merchandising" and why some girls like things as penis shaped candies or decoration?
This is something that is not symmetric along gender
because penis is funny. funny thing cute. women will buy funny cute thing.
It's a magical symbol of power.
Because penises look ridiculous and non threatening, like retarded mushrooms
And meanwhile in Japan.
Fake, funny cute things are inherently masculine. This is way moe things, fumo plushies, cute anime girls and all that are popular among men. Woman usually do things for different more manipulative or deep reasons, not because silly funny cute fun.
Yea, genitals are fertility symbols, retard. Other cultures worship vaginas too.
Women enjoy penises. Just not yours.

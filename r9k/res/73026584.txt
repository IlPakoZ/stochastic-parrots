fuck the shit out of fat girl
cuddle and spoon with her as if she were a wife of 10 years
buy her fast food if she's pleasant
ghost her and never speak to her again
rinse and repeat for years
Am I evil for this?
No, why? That sounds like a very nice one night stand, whats wrong with it?
It sounds more like you're afraid to be close to people, more than anything
He is scared to commit to his looksmatch
Also holy quads
i suppose it is bad if you lead her on. but if you ghosted as a clear message you dont want anything further i dont see the wrong, since this situation is super common when dating/fucking in the early stages especially on tinder
Why even treat women that nice? I once told a girl her vagina was so stinky I didn't want to fuck her, or be in a relationship right after she finally told me her grandfather raped her.
I kicked her out of my house when she was crying and pouting about it and shit.
As if I'm staying with damaged goods, lmaooo
This. Just tell people you don't want to see them anymore. It might still break their heart, but at least it's like ripping a bandaid.

Most of the time it costs nothing to be nice, but it can gain you things further down the line. Catching more flies with honey and all that.
Like imagine you need some paperwork handed in at some state institution years from now. And working the counter there is some woman you interacted with. She might give you a hard time if you were mean to her or help you if you were nice. Maybe this scenario is farfetched and trivial, but it's a small world and you never know who you interact with and what might get you in trouble some day. It still pays to be nice even if you're a total sociopath. If anything being cold and calculating should make you act extra nice even if you don't mean a word of it.

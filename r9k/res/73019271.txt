Less than 55 or greater than 450 mg/dL is considered critical. You're fine.
how you cheack that
Thank god I dont have diabetes
Lmao are you American?
Op go take some insulin and make sure to take it regularly after meals , blood sugar shouldn't elevate above 200 maximum post meals and shouldn't go above 120-140~ during fasting otherwise you'll really fuck up your vessels , kidneys, eyes long term.
The issue is these kinds of high blood sugars are unavoidable no matter what I seem to do
Gratz on not understanding what a critical value means, retard. OP has diabetes and normal range is unlikely for him. So long as he doesn't go critical he won't die.
I think both of you are wrong, normal range for me is loosely between 70 and 250, target 120
What I listed isn't a normal range you tard those are already diabetic values.
And just because op won't 'die' doesn't mean he should feel comfortable with having 200+ glucose nor does it mean he shouldn't correct it with insulin.
Consult your doctor my man.
Fix your diet , use insulin regularly and maybe increase the dose.

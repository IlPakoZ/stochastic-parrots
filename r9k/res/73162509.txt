Beep beep beep beep beep beep
I has croutons and cola for dinner. That is all.
skates away
i was thinking about essential oils recently and i wondered why we like the smells we like
the human body is so clever good smells are either are outright or are indicative of things which are good for us
it's like a shared memory of humanity with all your ancestors telling you what is "good" and what is "bad"
or similarly how things taste i've been thinking about that too since i've been getting back into cooking
it's so true that tasty things are food for you but unfortunately we live in very unusual conditions and industrial food tricks the mind
absolutely fascinating!
Hello again. So I've been watching a lot of YouTube about a new game coming out soon called Age of Wonders 4. It looks like fun but I'm afraid that I'll never have time to enjoy it. Between work, babysitting my niece and now seeing this girl on the weekends I'm completely swamped. I've also been stress eating and drinking again and I'm up 2kg from the start of the month.
Work remains fun. I think working in a call center has really improved my conversation abilities. I've gotten very good at controlling my voice and lying in a convincing way. The emotional high I get every time I get some rube to sign on for donating is still there too.
Bababooey Bababooey Howard Sterns Penis!

Why is it that wanting a girlfriend who isn't fat automatically means your standards are too high as a male? I've noticed that people throw that accusation around so much, and its clear what they really mean is that you're probably gonna have to date/fuck/marry a fat women, but they sugar coat it and gaslight you by making you believe your standards are unreasonable.

stop living in echo chambers nobody likes fat bitches

They mean you personally. Your standards are too high. Not all men.

80% of women are fat
<comment>
because in america something like 70% of women are grossly overweight or obese. skinny women can demand higher standards because there's less of them. most women are fat pieces of shit, if they're not fat they have a horrible skinny-fat disposition.

Because they want you to settle for roasties and lower expectations for women.
Those nipple piercings are gross.

Because your standards should match your worth. For most men, fat women are their equivalent, because they are unattractive. Demanding fit women is being a choosing beggar - sure, you can want what you want, but everyone else is free to laugh at you.

This. Everywhere I look there are fat women and men who are trying to stay in shape. The gym is all dudes other than 2-3 insta-thots, 2-3 high school athletes. The exception are the group classes which are 90% chubby women. 
Most women are fat pieces of shit.

I kinda in agree in that a fit average dude is basically worth a fat chick on the dating market, but I would never shame or laugh at anyone for wanting to at least not scrape the bottom of the barrel by dealing with whales. At that point its worth dreaming big, no pun intended.

It's funny bc they think they deserve better than that, or even worse, think they can realistically obtain better.
Know your worth.

fat obese people are literally my bullies too so

Over 75% of women are extremely fat. Women can't handle being rejected for their poor decisions so they try to act like fat isn't disgusting.

i used to think i only got fat women because i was an autistic loser and thats the best i could do, but then i looked at what other guys girlfriends looked like. normal guys, even some chads have fat GFs nowadays because society has sunk so low that almost all women are fat lazy peices of shit that will never take accountability for anything ever. being fat used ot be extremely rare and people would be disgusted and make fun of you. now, it's normal and being normal sized (no, not "thin", not "fit" just normal sized.) is an abberation. its a result of feminism telling women theyre perfect no matter what and capitalism pushing sugar on us.

normies claim wanting a non-fat woman with a cute face is basically chasing a super model. It's top tier gas lighting. Fuck fat roasties

"people" with vaginas and fatrolls?

I'm better than you fat roastie. Know your place you washed up whore
<comment>
I posted exactly this premise on /adv/ in the form of a question several years ago and the roasties on there denied it up and down 
of course since then a few more disgusting slampigs have indicated their interest in having access to my stable annual income, and the only solace I have is the satisfaction of rejecting them

Exactly. You look at most the e girls that become popular on r9k and they are average as hell, like nothing more than a 6, yet we always get accused of having crazy standards. Then the guys here you would expect them to be obese neckbeards, but the ones that do post pics are fairly average as well.
Normies don't want to ever admit how fucked up dating is for men, saying our standards are too high is just a way to rationalize our situations as, but not wanting to dat overweight people is very reasonable.

Time once again for a harem general. These are usually fun and/or interesting. 
Some questions to get things rolling
Do you want a harem or want to be in a harem?
How many harem members is too many?
Would the harem be purely sexual, or like a loving family type?
Would it bother you if some of the harem members were related?
Is sex one on one or daily orgies?
Maid outfits or lingerie?

Do you want a harem or want to be in a harem?
Yeah
How many harem members is too many?
I'm sure there's a numerical gold standard, but I'll simply say it's a measure of living vs dead weight. If I'm underperforming, or they're underperforming in absence of attention, then it's too many. Hell, 1 can be too many if it leaves you in negative. A harem has to be a plus.
Would the harem be purely sexual, or like a loving family type?
Soulmate collective
Would it bother you if some of the harem members were related?
Only from the worry that their own bond would threaten the whole.
Is sex one on one or daily orgies?
Both, orgy preferred, but the girls should always be ready to take my load, and I, encouraged to savor potency for optimal sessions. It's hard to tow between the allure of promoting healthy competition and wanting to provide for all of them together. In competition, I could have them snitch and punish each other for interrupting me outside playtime, but especially so if it graduates from teasing to cumming. Then there are other welcome dynamics such as a harem of dominants, at which point the day to day interaction between girls would be more in their court.
There are times I'd wanna focus all my efforts on one girl, including ganging up on her, but lots of times I'd welcome a cuddle puddle of suckling sluts.
Ideally we'd be busy enough that quickies would resemble innocent hentai treat instead of jealous problem. As fun as orgies sound, part of the harem fantasy is getting to experience all sorts of romantic scenarios with girls from differing walks of life. I want to be seduced into their private slice of the world with the parting of their slit, and they should be rewarded with concentrated dick if they're the one(s) helping to form that experience. But then I feel bad for any left out the same way I struggled to play with all my stuffed animals. Time restricts.
Maid outfits or lingerie?
Lingerie. The best maid fits practically are, anyway.

I should actually correct the second answer: it wouldn't necessarily be too many, but it isn't right, for whatever reason. Maybe it's the right number and the balance is brought from the party improving - or maybe a strap-on wielding addition serves missing puzzle piece.
But that's maybe less reliable (in the observable) than simply getting one's own shit together, even if express victory is attractive to me as someone who sees the line skippers but knows not how to do as they

I want a harem
How many harem members is too many?
4-5 is more than enough for me
Would the harem be purely sexual, or like a loving family type?
I'm not fucking 100% of the time I'm with them so sprinkle in a bit of family
Would it bother you if some of the harem members were related?
if they're good with it I don't care at all
Is sex one on one or daily orgies?
I'd dabble in both
Maid outfits or lingerie?
business casual

Hmm, 2D is great of course, but in Japan there are high end brothels that specialize in harems. Very strict with who they accept, and you need to drop a few grand. But you can get up to 6 girls at once. They'll do whatever cosplay and act you want, of course.
I could never, I get anxious just talking to one girl at a time.
But 6 catgirls... I can dream

 Have 
 I'd want to get real depraved with it - cap out at like 30 for the orgy potential
 I could see being more loving with a few favourites but baseline purely sexual
 Not in the slightest
 Always at least two at a time, but keeping it varied between relatively intimate bedroom threesomes and gigantic open-air fuckfests with everyone participating
 Relatively modest maid outfits but "you don't get to wear clothes for X days" is a commonly handed out punishment for any and no reason at all.

want harem
How many harem members is too many?
no more than 5 is sustainable long term. Ideally:
- 1 cute, very shy and homely
- 1 hot lazy sack of potato, gamer girl type
- 1 extremely horny and slutty
- 1 tsundere outer appearance girly girl
- 1 smart and resourceful one with frequent messy hair who has deep academic interests
the big problem would be preventing interpersonal conflicts and breaking apart into groups, will have to invent some ways to resolve that
Would the harem be purely sexual, or like a loving family type?
loving family type
Would it bother you if some of the harem members were related?
no, as long as they are not too many to form a group to bully the rest, one reason to have odd number.
Is sex one on one or daily orgies?
one on one, with schedules with honor system of not talking about their alone time with others with full transparency.
Maid outfits or lingerie?
Both are boring, I'd like to dress each one particularly for their body type and something that fits their personality. There are some good non-maid outfits from isekai animes and video games worth trying on.

Do you want a harem or want to be in a harem?
Honestly nether. I don't really like possessing people and thus being responsible for them nor do I like the restriction of freedom of being possessed.
The kind of harems that are most ideal to me are the ones that are basically self sufficient groups of women who value me as more or less a breeding stud and shared sex object of the group rather than a care taker of the group.
How many harem members is too many?
That is a matter of budget and logistics.
Yet another reason why I prefer my version of harem over the typical one. It isn't bound by my budget and management. It is instead only limited by how many women can get along in a intentional community or commune. Which is a far greater number.
Would the harem be purely sexual, or like a loving family type?
I am aromantic so obviously it would lean towards being more about sex, but it would be nice to play a role in raising the children that result from all the sex.
Would it bother you if some of the harem members were related?
Not in the least. As long as they are able to get along it's a bonus as far as I am concerned.
Is sex one on one or daily orgies?
Orgies on special occasions, one on one as the everyday common form of sex.
Regular casual skinship and cuddles to maintain the feeling of affection and being desired more generally amongst the group to make up for not being able to have as much one on one time as desired for a larger harem.
Don't want someone to feel left out and grow resentment.
Maid outfits or lingerie?
Nude when within the compound, simple loose, comfortable, practically dresses for when outside the compound.
Naked apron for activities that aren't practical to do completely nude.
Nude under cloak for formal occasions.

What kind of guy fantasizes as being apart of a harem?

- 1 cute, very shy and homely
- 1 hot lazy sack of potato, gamer girl type
- 1 extremely horny and slutty
- 1 tsundere outer appearance girly girl
- 1 smart and resourceful one with frequent messy hair who has deep academic interests
Do you realise that juat two girls could fill in all of those niches?
Like 1 and 4 are combinable, and 2 3 5 are also combinable.

If I were a girl I don't think I would want to be part of a harem. It there's only one guy you would have to constantly fight over his dick that sounds annoying
<comment>
I think a harem would only be only sexual in the beginning. If you have daily sex you would become like a family with time by default

Do you want a harem or want to be in a harem?
I want to own a harem
How many harem members is too many?
Not possible. I think the best would be around q
100 so you could have three or four a day and book them all on a rotating basis. 
Would the harem be purely sexual, or like a loving family type?
I would have a wife I love and probably 3 concubines who I love too. The rest would be just for serving me and for fucking. 
Would it bother you if some of the harem members were related?
It would be non-optional. I would have as many sets of twins or even triplets as I could find. My dream goal is to fuck triplets and have a hand or cock in all three at once. 
Is sex one on one or daily orgies?
Both
Maid outfits or lingerie?
Nude with collars.

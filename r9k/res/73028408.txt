No need to explain Mouse utopia experiment to local bots, I assume?
But recap to newcomers
Given the disturbing parallels between that experiment and our society (especially western one) is this ultimate fate of humans too?
If no, then why not?
If yes, then can it be stopped and even maybe undone?
Brainstorming session for local autists basically.
I don't give a fuck; I want my fucking UBI, so I never have to go outside and deal with normies again.
Just as when the blessed Lockdown never made much difference to my life, except improve it, I adapted and enjoyed it immensely.
UBI is gay and retarded and an excellent way to crash a currency with hyperinflation. Youre a gay nigger
The jews already ruined the economy with fiat money, globalism and outsourcing to foreign slaves fifty years ago.
Now fuck you, pay me.
You forgot one small, but very important detail: experiment was fake, made up and doesn't replicate. Stop building worldview based on fake and non-replicating studies.
You'll get paid in toilet paper like Weimar Germany because you're an economically illiterate subhuman. Go get crippled and apply for neetbux if you wanna suck the govts teet so god-damned badly
Do you really think they'll allow the study today?
How so?
Was it not performed?
Were outcomes and actual behavior different?
Check and couldn't find anyone deboonking it.
Why you claim experiment was fake and gay?

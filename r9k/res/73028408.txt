No need to explain Mouse utopia experiment to local bots, I assume?
But recap to newcomers
Mice were provided with all the food and water they will ever need in environment safe from predators and elements with enough space for 3k mice, but population never reached that point.
Eventually their social structure deteriorated from normal mouse behavior.
Females stopped having children more and more (either by no sex, abandonment or outright murder). Also they were becoming more and more aggressive.
Males split into minority of hyperagressive Alphas whose favorite hobbies included murder, rape and cannibalism (sometimes simultaneously), and majority of antisocial incels.
Few children who still had parents were becoming progressively fucked up because they never saw how normal mice behave.
Results were total collapse of population.
Given the disturbing parallels between that experiment and our society (especially western one) is this ultimate fate of humans too?
If no, then why not?
If yes, then can it be stopped and even maybe undone?
Brainstorming session for local autists basically.

I don't give a fuck; I want my fucking UBI, so I never have to go outside and deal with normies again.
Just as when the blessed Lockdown never made much difference to my life, except improve it, I adapted and enjoyed it immensely.

UBI is gay and retarded and an excellent way to crash a currency with hyperinflation. Youre a gay nigger

The jews already ruined the economy with fiat money, globalism and outsourcing to foreign slaves fifty years ago.
Now fuck you, pay me.

You forgot one small, but very important detail: experiment was fake, made up and doesn't replicate. Stop building worldview based on fake and non-replicating studies.

You'll get paid in toilet paper like Weimar Germany because you're an economically illiterate subhuman. Go get crippled and apply for neetbux if you wanna suck the govts teet so god-damned badly

Do you really think they'll allow the study today?

experiment was fake, made up
How so?
Was it not performed?
Were outcomes and actual behavior different?

Check and couldn't find anyone deboonking it.
Why you claim experiment was fake and gay?

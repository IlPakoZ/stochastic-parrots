Will getting into photography give me a life, a soul, and a way to meet others who aren't hollow wageslaves like me?
Probably not. Photography is a very isolated individual hobby
Do it, but go into micro photography and do food
No. If you take professional pictures, most people are vain and annoying. That will be your clientele
Most people i interact with now are vain and annoying

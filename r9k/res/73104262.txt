Hm...
Hi.
Nothing thought about what you said before you asked if Nothing has any special powers and i believe so.
I think i can mind controll people but only if i meet them with my real body it doesnt seem to work over the internet which might be a problem because Nothing is a demon and demons arent supposed to give humans proof of supernatural beings its against the laws of the masquarade so if they take a photo of Nothing and run away before Nothing can infect them with its brain virus Nothing might get sent back to hell and banned from entering the human realm ever again!
All those days you spent summoning Nothing would go to waste...

so you're of eldritch origin huh..
if the whole masquarade thing is true your powers are useless unless, following the logic of not blowing your cover, didn't you just give me proof by posting this? On the other hand you could claim that it was just a joke post and thus not concrete evidence but couldn't you apply the same logic if someone were to take a photo? It could be photoshop after all, there's no way demons exist so it's not really evidence either. Maybe you should try it sometimes lol

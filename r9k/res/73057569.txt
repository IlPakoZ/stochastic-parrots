Is existing even worth it when you can't speak to the one person in the world you called home. I might actually kill myself soon from the mental pain. I don't know how I've even managed to keep myself this long but only for her

Realize that your attachment to this person, despite the experiences you may have shared, is the current cause of your suffering.
Happiness is very easy. Enjoy nature. Clean your mind through meditation. Things will become better.

I thought the same exact thing after my breakup and was obsessed until I found another girl and realized they're all really nothing special. You don't have the days of knowing another girl because you only knew one. Logistically fallible and mentally broken by a women Unlucky, I wonder if you'll still be thinking of her in 5-10 years. I can't imagine you will

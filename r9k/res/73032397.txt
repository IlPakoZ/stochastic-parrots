my desire to get feminized grows every time i go outside and see hot women. 
If i dont go outside for months the fetish dies. What does this mean?

what does this mean
it means you are yet another casualty in the central intelligence agency's endless psychological war against disaffected young men

don't do it if its just a fetish hrt will kill your libido and then you will be left with nothing

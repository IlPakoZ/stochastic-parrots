Human genetic adaptation stopped 40,000 years ago and there has been zero human evolution since especially in response to challenges presented by agriculture and civilization. If you say otherwise you're an evil Nazi incel chud.

Looking at who women pick and how tallest and most sociopathic guys get to the top of companies I would say that yes it stopped 40k years ago. Or more accurately it didn't stop but it was unable to keep up with how quickly shit changed and we are still closer to cave dwelling monkeys than humans building civilizations.

Probably I haven't looked at her since graduation. I made the mistake of not going out with her when she clearly liked me in sophomore year. We had an elective together which was two periods long. I never did anything and now she had a kid with some black dude. 
I wonder sometimes if I fucked up the girls that liked me by not going out with them when they made it obvious. I'm no Chad but I had a few fat ugly chicks crush on me. I saw one fat Christian girl at the store the other day, I said hi but she seemed upset. Idfk man

kek same I had confirmation from multiple people that she liked me but I was too pussy to make a move.

Exactly that's always been my problem too. It's like I'm afraid of success or something. I bet you didn't even need the other people to tell you she liked you.
You knew instinctually that she was into you yet you did nothing about it. I bet she even made it obvious to you too. That's what happened to me. I remember asking one of her friends a question when she was around and she got all giddy and shy, hiding her face and what not. Yet I still did nothing. Am I a fucking queer? I might be. Fuck everything

Why do you fags even think about this still?

How do you not? I guess you're lucky. I think about all the mistakes I made a lot. What do you think about? I guess whatever you wanna do next right? The next thing you wanna buy to fill the void? Idk what you think about but whatever it is you don't have any say in it just like me. So fucking relax and get off your high horse and if you have anything to say say it and if you don't call me a fag and move on

Yeah it was pretty obvious she was into me. The rest was just confirming what I knew what true. >>73050108

For me I think it was some type of imposter syndrome. My crush was one of the hottest/cutest girls in high school. I couldn't believe that she would be into me (a chubby average normal dude). I still don't really undertand why she was into me that is what puzzles me the most.
Because it was my only chance. There was ONE girl who was into me and I blew it.

I don't even remember if I had a crush on people when I was a teenager guy

If you could pin point exactly why she was into you what would you say it was? Are you tall? Attractive? Funny? Charming? Do you look like her dad? Did you grow up together? What is it?
For me I think it was because I looked like I should be playing football yet I took geeky classes and had an awkward disposition if that makes any sense. It's like I was a handsome enough geek or an attainable brad, idk.

It was one of two times in my life that I've been close to a woman. I don't think about her hitting the wall though. That's kind of weird. I hope that wherever she is, she's doing well and is happy.

How do you function? Do you remember what street you grew up on? What do you do all day with a memory like yours? I can't fathom not remembering childhood or even the last 10 years and not mulling over regrets every once in a while.

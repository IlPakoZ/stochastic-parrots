I do not currently live this life, but this is how I plan to live once I finish my degree. I will start a job or a masters sometime after I finish but I can conduct the rest of what ought to be done alongside it. 
- Wake early.
- Cut out caffeine entirely.
- Dress well.
- Conduct myself well, speech, posture, body language etc.
- Maintain good hygiene &amp; looks, dental, skin, hair, nails etc.
- Aim for a very high level of organisation, presentation, punctuality.
- Do chores more routinely, on a set time.
- Aim to make as little mess in the first place to avoid time spent tidying and cleaning. 
- Find a source of side income that is not too time demanding.
- Add to and expand my investments.
- Almost entirely cut out screen time and bad habits.
- Go back over old bearings and make sure I am performing what I have learned at university optimally.
- Practice creative activities in my spare time, drawing, music, writing etc.
- Seek consultancy from the most accomplished professionals I can talk to, to aid in whatever I feel like I require help in to gain a better understanding.
- Go on more hikes.
- reflection in &amp; on action so that I can perfect my methods. 
- Backup all my important data, encrypt the especially important. 
- Get rid of everything I do not need items, files, etc. 
- Improve my superficial understanding of useful academic fields (Knowledge that can be used for my own benefit) to better understand what is most important to gain a more in depth understanding of e.g. engineering, psychology, philosophy, physics, maths, business, economics, code, technology, chemistry, biology, medicine, neurology, logic, English, law, intelligence, theology, art, literature, computer science. I will do this by reading scientific papers and the necessary books and textbooks. As my understanding progresses, I will begin to specialise my study increasingly towards the job I want.
- Improve reading comprehension to accelerate learning rate and gain general knowledge by reading plenty of various books to once more aid my understanding of what I should be doing. I will spend time researching which books are most likely to be of use. 
- I will also aim my study at learning how to properly perform my tasks.
- Document &amp; organise all relevant information, both in paper files in folders and excel spread sheets so any information I need can be accessed easily. 
- Use excel to tabulate and graph the data in my life so that I can better interpret how to optimise it. I can find this data recording the numbers on what I did each day and by running the necessary experiments. 
- re-decorate my room to my liking (sleek, neat, professional, etc.).
- Maintain responsibilities towards my family.
- Socialise on a somewhat regular basis to maintain good mental health.
- Do a bit of travelling and experience some fun activities.
- Achieve a calm and consistent way of working, doing tasks properly rather than trying to rush through, following instructions, getting it right the first time, rather than just doing things my own way. 
- Exercise, train, practice etc.
- Develop a routine for achieving my goals, doing things on time, and optimally using time.
- Learn a language, I was thinking Dutch.
- Potentially start some kind of project (maybe something coupled with my side income venture).
- Optimise my health e.g., sleep, diet (graph necessary meal plans &amp; nutrition amounts in excel, following keto and med diet), supplements.
- Improve my typing ability.
- Learn to drive.
- Record briefly, what I did each day, how I felt, what progress was made, what my short-term goals are, what I ate, what improvements can be made, what I will do the next day. 
- Research different software and website I can use to conduct my tasks. 
- Develop any further hard skills that might be of use.
- Continue to expand my understanding of how I more indepthly improve this lifestyle. 
- Sleep early.
I will do all this bar anything else besides the time I take off on Sundays and wind down time before. Most of my time will be spend studying and practicing with some sport on the side. I've always been quite intuitively gifted, but I feel like what has been holding me back recently is more my own ignorance, so it's time for me to learn to think properly and expand my knowledge, pushing my ability as far as I possibly can. The plan is to be the best bar non at what I do. Further into the future I plan to start networking too, once I have more assets and finances, I can start using it to delegate my tasks and potentially build the kind of organisation that I have in mind as well as engineer what I want to engineer. I will try and base as many of my decisions on scientific evidence as I can both through my research and my own experiments. Once I have done what needs to be done, I can cut back on the workload and live a more sustainable and healthier lifestyle. Like small creases do not matter in a shirt because the body heat removes them, all I need to is focus on the bigger tasks and anything I might have missed here will be reconciled into the organising goal along the way.

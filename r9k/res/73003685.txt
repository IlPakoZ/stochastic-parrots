how do i enjoy life if my dopamine receptors are naturally down regulated and i have no motivation to do anything and care about nothing?
Nice meme but nothing like that exists. Try something before writing it off as sour grapes.
Try not attributing magical properties to dopamine. If you have ADHD, there's medication for that.
I would suggest actively thinking rather than just allowing things to happen. The prefrontal cortex exists to facilitate long term planning which is only possible with the use of articulate thought. Instead of just living on autopilot, plan out what you are going to do hour by hour, day by day, week by week etc. Constantly seeking new sources of pleasure only hinders your ability to think long term thus preventing you from having access to all sources of pleasure once your life comes crashing down in flames. You don't need to do a dopamine fast but cutting out sources of pleasure from your life such as sugar, video games and orgasm are a must if you want to be driven to accomplish things. But the important thing is to understand that while working towards a goal you will suffer from the temptation to give up. Working towards goals is not always going to be an enjoyable process but you have to persist if you want to make things happen and avoid ending up in the same situation in the future. Remember, the more you resist the temptation to give up, the stronger your ability to focus becomes.

Everything can be attributed to scientific reductionism.
Who provides for you?
Just get a prescription for amphetamines or methylphenidate. If that doesn't help, then dopamine isn't the problem
Quit addictive substances and take up intense exercise and meditation, that's your only hope

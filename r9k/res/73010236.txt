hm. write me a poem now.

What's the point of a practice gf if you're not going to send her money? Real girlfriends cost a lot of money so you need to practice for that responsibility.

so many posts like these, have robots finally left their misogynistic roots and taken the simping path?
<comment>
Yeah if this doesn't work out for me I'm taking the pinkpill
<comment>
Robots have always simped for egirls and fembots. Almost all of them long for the love of a woman but there are some very vocal women haters.
<comment>
hmm not forgive because your immediate reaction was to be mean. good luck

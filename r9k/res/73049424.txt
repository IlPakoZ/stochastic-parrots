How do I make someone from the internet meet up with me in real life?
pay them with your pennies and say meet me for this price and have a coffee for this amount of time.
I think the person would just reject my money but I could try. He pretty much neves leaves his house but I wanna help him have friends in real life. What places could I invite him to go?
if he never leave his house this is difficult as I never leave my house, it is too comfy in here and the outside world is a mess and full of chaos
First send letters and try and get a reply, find out what that person likes and dislikes, then you can build on getting them to go outside.
Literally anywhere 
The movies, hiking, the lake, parks, bowling, dinner, breakfast, lunch, places that matter to you, book clubs, stores, bars, concerts, rodeo, amusement parks, farms, races, home, work, etc.
How can I send him letters if he does not give me his house adress? Or you meant virtual ones
I asked him if he wanted to go to the cinema with me and he said he has to do an eye surgery or something. Maybe I could try to get him to visit a store with me at night because people that dont like leave house prefer leaving at night right?

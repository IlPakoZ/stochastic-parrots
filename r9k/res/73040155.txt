Be me
Be 16 (in 2002)
Be troubled teen in conservative Arizona
Height of sheriff joes popularity, with many working in law enforcement or corrections idolizing him
get caught smoking brick weed that barely had any thc in it at all by security guard at the mall.
get handed notice to appear in court
65 days in a shithole private juvvy
It was indoor and we had AC and school inside. But any time not spent in school meant you got put on the yard in 130+ weather.
The director of the place is a 300 pound dyke, she pretended like she was the female incarnation of joe arpaio.
Would do things like eating five guys in front of us while we were served slop.
changing the tv we were watching to something childish such as cartoon network or disney channel (and then lock up the remote for the night).
When kids would cry she would talk to them in her condescending southern accent, she would say just the right things to set them off and make them more upset.
Banned any drinks besides water because "Its more healthy", yet she drank a smoothie in front of us while announcing the policy.
Would randomly order "shake downs" and break our stuff / rip up our family pictures / letters.
This whole experience has to lead me to never be able to trust a woman.
Im damn near a 40 year old and scared to talk to girls, and I blame our fucked up system for the trauma this dyke has caused me.
For those of you who support tough on crime republican politics like this, can you explain how I am a better person for having gone through a summer of abuse at the hands of a incarcerationist?

weed's a gateway drug, you'd probably have got into meth or some shit. and what the fuck were you doing hanging out in a mall instead of doing homework or at a library, working to better yourself and repay your parents for raising you? do you think they wanted to raise an addict?

Yeah, the chance of OP possibly being briefly happy while high on drugs is too much of a risk to take. We need to make sure he's constantly miserable and sober for every fucking minute of it, because tradition and is just a fancy word for old-timey sadism.

Well maybe next time you won't smoke shitty dirt weed. If you had some higher quality weed maybe the security guard might have let you go.

Why would police chief even be elected? America truly retarded. Should be opposite of police chief not allowed to participate in any politics

people shouldn't have any democratic input into the guy who wields monopoly state violence against them
sounds legit

What >>73040355 posted. THEORETICALLY it introduces some local, democratic accountability in policing, especially in the states that used to make up the Wild West before railroads (and much later the interstate highway system) meant communities were more isolated from each other than the developed east coast. Of course the trade-off is, as you posted, it introduces politics into what should be a non-political purely functional arm of governance. 
Ultimately the problem with America is the enshrined belief that you can have your cake and eat it too, which causes a lot of the problems that are prevalent today.

be me
19yo femcel
khv but really into dominant guys
looks, height, dick size, none of it really matters as long as the guy is nice and dominant
make a post on reddit to that effect
DMs flooded with message requests
every single conversation goes the exact same way:
hey

that would unironically be just as bad. i want a guy to discuss things with me not just spout NPC voice lines until he thinks it's socially acceptable to ask to see my tits
<comment>
somewhere in a dark room your mother is weeping because of the disappointment you turned out to be
<comment>
i don't think the kind of guy you're after would really label himself as "dominant". perhaps he would label himself as "normal" or at the very outside "confident", but confident men aren't looking for girls on reddit
<comment>
i knew i recognized your face from somewhere
<comment>
shame you're only into doms haha
<comment>
haha ive just been keeping busy haha
can you tell me more about it?
This is how I know you're larping. No foid would ever ask this from a random guy when she's flooded with DMs.
<comment>
You're kind of selecting for this by asking for nice and dominant.
<comment>
OP you are an immature retard and here is some friendly advice. posting "i wanna dominant guy teehee" on the internet is not going to attract tough independent men who will take charge and not think twice about it, make you feel safe and free from scary decisions etc etc. you will in fact attract a ratlike horde of braindead coomers
<comment>
honestly that's a valid critique. i like confident men/men who exude masculine energy. i'm fine with a "normal" guy, but so many of these guys are weakdicked idiots who literally cant carry a conversation they themselves start
<comment>
i like femboys too!!
we actually do, just not ugly guys &lt;33
nice and dominant are not mutually exclusive. you'd know that if you ever had a healthy male role model
<comment>
Booooooo fucking hooooooooo. (But Im open to talking since Im bored and sick on my day off) so the entertainment is transactional
<comment>
I wasn't suggesting they are.
<comment>
ratlike horde of braindead coomers
that's a funny way to spell "gen z"
<comment>
Actually agree with this guy. Also, you won't find a man like that here, and most of them do not want anything with a 19 yo girl (except maybe a one night stand) since you'll change your view and go through a lot of stuff on life a lot (and this is completely normal) and most guys like that are older and do not want someone who is still "unstable" (mostly thanks to age/life experience issues)
See, I'm a 29 yo ex-McK consultant with a girlfriend, already had 2 relationships and I think this one is the one I'm going to marry, have kids, etc., and I can only that with some degree of confidence since I know she was a somewhat solid project for her life.

nice and dominant are not mutually exclusive
No but being both is hard as fuck and a guy who's both has too many bitches on his dick to date a girl that posts on r9k
<comment>
Why do you think you deserve a dominant guy?

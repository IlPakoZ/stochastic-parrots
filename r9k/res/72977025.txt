Why do women do this to us?
<comment>
Because you really be out there asking out popular, busy, successful hotties. Its insulting. Aim at your own kind. 
inb4 even ugly lardasses dont want us because they want chad!!
Bullshit. Its not anyones fault that you choose obese girls with party Stacy mindset. 
Have some common sense and look at realistic places you would want to meet a PARTNER. Cons, libraries, hobby spots, college campuses. Have some personality and be a decent fucking person. Looks cant be your excuse forever.
<comment>
fuck off with this delusional bullshit.
<comment>
The funniest part is that they always say this regardless of how they look, even ugly obese cunts have the gall to shit talk average guys who hit of them for being "out of their league".
Women suddenly stop being cunts in real life
Nevermind, this is the funniest part; the retards defending it.
<comment>
Have fun getting rejected over and over again because of your insecure passive self victimizing mindset
<comment>
Have fun with (thing that never happens)
What makes r*dditors talk like this? Regardless, personality is a meme and women will date men that literally beat them so long as he's good looking enough. Keep lying though, it's kinda funny.
<comment>
Because they can but they don't. Stop falling for mentally ill attention whores on twitter starting shit. I have been rejected multiple times and noone was mean to me.
<comment>
Keep being insecure and covering it up with stubborn chronically online takes
<comment>
Just ignore reality
Cool
<comment>
The thot is just tired of ugly guys filling her DMs. Little does she know, guys like any sort of attention women give them.
<comment>
I would pay all my neetbux just to lick her feet
<comment>
What reality? Have you ever asked a girl out? What was her response? Was she laughing in your face hysterically and spat in your face just to leave and make out passionately with Chad? 
Go outside and see your retarded muh data muh statistics muh ngmi genes takes completely crumble under YOUR own irl individual interactions and experiences
<comment>
I don't approach anyone anymore because everyone treated me like shit, the more I tried to interact the worse it got so I opted out and in turn they left me the fuck alone. I asked a few girls out in highschool each ending with some variation of mockingly letting me down "gently" or outright scorn. Both data and observable reality are on my side, your argument is nonsense based on the idea that life is fair and all u gotta do is TRI! Going outside only vindicates my beliefs, you're a normalfaggot with rose tinted glasses who thinks their personal experience is universal.
<comment>
why are there so many roasties here today whining about how men only want stacy, or 'girls with a stacy mindset' (lmao)?
<comment>
You are just weak minded and bitter. Imagine still being salty about rejections from high school so much that you stop trying in your adult life. 
observable reality
Aka something that has nothing to do with you but you decide to base your assumptions on it and treat it like a universal truth.
Whatever man, stay a salty incel if thats such a precious position to you that you are willing to justify and defend it for the rest of your life.
<comment>
Because their mindset immediately falls apart under the most basic of scrutiny, so they resort to taking an argument that men make;
Women only want Chad
and reversing the sexes despite the fact that is is observably untrue;
Men only want Stacy
They can't make up their own arguments so they just take and corrupt the opposition's.

If she is so successful why is she still single
<comment>
The vast majority of humans are like this. You give someone a disproportionate amount of power, and they'll use it for fun.

nta but i met an autistic girl at my community college. she was really cute and nerdy so i was genuinely attracted to her and not just trying to date-down. anyways we talked for a bit and then i took her out to lunch because her next class wasn't until 2h (i was done my classes for the day).
anyway... we went out for about a month and it was the happiest time of my life. then one day she hits me with "im not ready for a relationship right now", and i cried myself to sleep that night. i don't understand how you're supposed to recover when a literal-autistic girl rejects you.
<comment>
aiming out of their league
That's the thing. We really don't lol
<comment>
when a literal-autistic girl rejects you.
That sounds so belittling.
<comment>
stop quoting this bitch lmao im not even mad i googled her and she is clearly from grippy sock jail. i mean, i even feel bad for how much you can tell she is fucking suffering inside
<comment>
Just wait till that bitch gets hit with a uppercut.
<comment>
well? can you blame them? your whole life revolves around them and you elevate their egos. learn to ignore women. the more attention you give holes, the more self important they'll feel.
<comment>
When we do it "it's insulting", when they do it they just have a "party Stacy mindset"?
<comment>
which league are girls like picrel?
<comment>
Ugly white guys, this doesnt phase ugly shitskins
<comment>
Remember when women say an "ugly" guy hit on them it's probably actually some 7/10 dude and her self esteem took a hit from a non-gigachad honestly thinking he had a chance.
Actual ugly dudes don't try at all.
<comment>
Just date a cute dog instead of a woman.
<comment>
do you think that someone like the chud in picrel can get a gf by just stop being insecure and put himself out there? assume everyone here is as ugly unless something else is specificied, incel until proven guilty etc.
<comment>
And who said fat ugly girls who hit on Chad arent as embarrassing and delusional as incels who try to hit on Stacies?
<comment>
Yes. Believe it or not, he can if he actually puts in effort
<comment>
(You) did by calling them party girls with Stacy mindset. Would you ever call us party boys with a Chad mindset? 
inb4 you don't go to parties inkler!!!
I have been to many parties.
<comment>
Imagine still being salty about rejections from high school so much that you stop trying in your adult life.
I tried and it didn't work, you want me to keep trying and keep failing until I get old and die despite always get the exact same results? Well fuck you, I'm not doing it.
assumptions
Both my anecdotal experience and statistics agree with me you absolute retard, the only one coping and grasping to their argument like their life depends on it in spite of the world around them is you.
<comment>
Women can now smell the incel on you
<comment>
Why did they refuse to help him?
<comment>
This means your face looks bad btw
They cant tell when Chad is woman beating sadist with misogyny beyond any incel
<comment>
work in
Both very wrong and very vague. He is honestly so ugly that there's unironically no hope for him, he's St Blackops2cel tier desu. He's also pale, scrawny and skinnyfat.
<comment>
This, OP is high on her own farts
<comment>
He's also pale,
But I thought pale was good, you know, because women on the other hand berate men for not using suncreen and having skin damage by 30.
<comment>
women
"ew gross pasty incel, go outside"
also women
"men don't even use sunscreen and their skin looks all leatherly, ew"
<comment>
that's not true, they are very sensitive to this, how else could they reliably choose the worst man possible if they couldn't differentiate him from the rest?
<comment>
Thats true very true
<comment>
she can only do this until she hits the wall, after which all of her simps will have moved on to the newest 18 year old e girl..............
<comment>
Pale and light skinned isn't necessarily the same thing. Just having a bit of good collagen and rosy cheeks and you're golden. This guy however has none of that, his complexion just makes him look unhealthy.
<comment>
 just look like your tiktok filter bro.
<comment>
Those glasses are horrible and haircut looks like a lesbian. Change those and he would look better, not anywhere near Chad tier but it would help
<comment>
yes, it's always the glasses and the haircut. Truth is though that he'll look shit no matter what he does.

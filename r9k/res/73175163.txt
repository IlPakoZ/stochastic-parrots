Learn how to network and go to bars. Life is easy
<comment>
nobody networks at bars if they're not already fully networked there, retard.
<comment>
The average person has a support network, people who give a shit about them and affirm them and give them attention and advice. They had good parents who instilled self-esteem and discipline in them at a young age. The average /r9k/ robot does not have these things.

Same, I am now extremely bitter every time I see one of those "teehee reaching out for help is the hardest step :))))" platitudes because when I reach out for help I'm just met with silence or rejection. Fucking normies couldn't deal with COVID and now all the psychs are full... ugh.
I hope you can find help eventually anon, I refuse to believe it's over

Yeah, pretty much. Children are like sponges, if you grew up with emotionally and or verbally abusive parent(s) you absorbed all of that, mostly subconsciously. I did some self-reflection on my life and I came to the conclusion that the reason I run away from struggle and give up on things very fast is because whenever I'd see my dad as a kid he and my mom would fight and he'd slam the door and just leave the situation. I subconsciously copied that behavior. Stressed and angry? Just leave. The worst part is that even though I know this and have acknowledged this behavior still nothing has changed, I still do it because it's programmed into me.

is that english, schizo. Think through the words you're using. We're not the voices in your head who can understand your gibberish.
That being said, i love you.

The "majority" is literally patrick bateman.
Nihilist corporate workers who delve in escapism through casuals sex, drugs and tobacco.
The "4chan chad" (aka 140lb, 6'2, frail with mushroom hair) is a perfect example of the nihilists i am talking about.
The actual chads are the people who got to the top of the economy, they married an 18 year old virgin or a child wife from sri lanka and have a happy family.
"Normies" dont hwve it better.
The only difference between you twats and "normies" is that you keep talking about "muh sadness, muh loneliness" instead of going outside and socializing or having a hobby.

nah the difference is they have average paying jobs and a life and can do this and not neetbuxers/disabilitycucks/neets without money
that is the difference
money is the major factor here
normies have it way good
<comment>
It's not. It's all a facade. Everyone is miserable in their own unique way, they're just better at hiding it
<comment>
This. You're not missing out on much. Having a girlfriend and a nice big house doesn't mean anything. It's over.

do you really not feel pity when you look at the page for a company and see "X Y is the leader of *company's* *corporate term* division since 2015?" pity for how terrible their lives must be having to waste it on some company where everyone probably hates them outside of when they're getting paid? i would never call them a real chad

Most people are just barely hanging on by a thread anon. Everyone is fucked in the bank, prescription drug use is higher than ever, job market is total dogshit, everything is slowly crumbling down with worse qualities of life, etc. Back in the day people grinded away at jobs so they could live it up big somewhere nice, now they do it just for basic survival because they are buried up to their neck in debt. The average person is not doing well at all, they are just seen more positively than your average robot.
Personally I became kind of the opposite, where I became much more combative and extremely low tolerant of other peoples bullshit.

Here in yurope if you have average IQ parents you are passing coming out of 5 year uni debt free 
The average paid person has 4 times the expendable income compared to me on welfarebux
No, you have no idea how good things normal functioning people have it, never the less even more educated people
Yearly travels trips and everything better
Idk how shit you have it but
Nope my worst moments when I had no money
Money fixes alot of things very fast

Also your parents loan you the money for buying a flat so you can skip the inner city 10 year wait times too and get into the housing market instantly
Compared to living with the nigs after waiting for years in the hood yoo

Why do normies backtalk each other with gossip and backhanded comments 24/7?
Why still hangout with someone if you dont like them?
they take social bonds for granted and act selfishly
we retards are genuinely better people to each other because we know how bad it sucks
i'm pretty certain it's literally entertainment

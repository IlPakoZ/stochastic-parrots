 be me
 go onto Reddit 
 I find a subreddit 
 must find a subreddit with the most vulnerable persons
 r/Mtf
 basically a trans subreddit
 talk trash 
 someone sends me a dm
 is a offended member of the trans community
 ask where I live
 gets a idea
 I go onto the persons profile and find a subreddit called r/sanfrancisco
 says I live in San Francisco 
 the offended manbaby says he wants to meet up to teach me a lesson 
 wants to fight me 
 we agree to meet up at a parking lot while as I continue to harass this poor man
 later that night the guy says he is at that location
 call cops from home kek
 says there is someone who threatens me at that park 
 never heard from him again
 I look up in sfchronicle
 the local newspaper at San Francisco 
 there is a small article about a man arrested wearing a balaclava and a knife at that park
 they also found a lot of guns at the persons home 
 basically i got a future terrorist arrested by trolling them on Reddit
 proves my theory that Reddit is a place full of mentally disturbed individuals
I can still hear the sound of all that clapping.
Doing the Lord's work, Anon.
Reddit is a place full of mentally disturbed individuals
And 4chan isn't?

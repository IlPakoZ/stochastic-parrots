what happens to people who spent their late teens/ early 20s mostly angry, but like in a solely internal sort of way, not really outwardly or scumbag-like?
Just look at the stats
People are getting married later if getting married at all
People are having kids later and fewer if having kids at all
Fertility and marriage rates are way down
We live in an isolating time
I'm still angry. Just tired. And I have a Black Flag tattoo lol
that's cool yo. i'm not a fan of tattoos but one of the Black Flag logo is on the based side to me
I push everyone away or keep them at a safe emotional distance and every time, my hunches about them are correct.
I'm not willing to change and i have not found anyone willing to tolerate how i am.

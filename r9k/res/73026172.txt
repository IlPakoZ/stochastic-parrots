How much bodyfat% do you think im gonna lose guys in a week if I do HIIT cardio like 2 times a day everyday in sets of like 20-30 mins and eat a max of 2000 calories a day and focus on getting my daily protein intake?
Not too sure anon, Ive done the same thing for around a year now and my weight is pretty steady, no idea about body fat% but at least you'll be pretty fit. I add in a 7.2 km 30 min timed run every week and would highly recommend it.
Best of luck king

Lord, I confess that up till now I have not lived as a Christian. I am not worthy to be numbered among Your elect. I recognize that I deserve to be damned, but Your mercy is great and, full of confidence in Your grace, I say to You that I want to save my soul, even if I have to sacrifice my fortune, my honor, my reputation, my very life -- as long as I am saved. If I have been unfaithful up to now, I repent, I deplore, I detest my infidelity. I ask You humbly to forgive me for it. Forgive me, good Jesus, and strengthen me also, that I may be saved. I ask You not for wealth, honor, or deliverance from my mortal death; I ask you for one thing only: to save my soul. Amen.

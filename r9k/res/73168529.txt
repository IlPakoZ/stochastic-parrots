how is my accent? Haven't spoken English for a month, I'm afraid my accent has gotten worse over this time :(
Aiming for a native-like accent.
There are occasional lapses (besides the mispronunciation) where I can hear the hint of a foreign accent, but overall it sounds pretty good. However, it seemed very clear you were reading and sort of processing what you were reading in your head before it came out, so perhaps you need to focus more on your reading ability?
Also, you seem to have picked up this vocal fry affectation that I personally find very annoying. I assume you've been learning English from an American resource? I don't think it's a good accent to pick up, and I don't think you'd have that same affectation in your native language, though perhaps I am wrong.
Your accent is not very noticeable, I'd assume you were native, however, your affect is a bit strange, I get that you were reading off of a script and many natives read in the same way, but tempo and tone are off
Just to add to this, you also seem to pause when speaking normally, which a lot of people do, but it again seems like a processing thing to me? Perhaps you should practice speaking with some sort of rhythm, maybe reading some poetry out loud and trying to sound consistent.
One of the things I notice a lot with foreigners is their terrible pronunciation of the "th" sound, which you seem very good on.
britfag here, you sound just like an american to me, with some slight hints of a foreign accent.
also have to agree with this anon on the vocal fry, you sound like what I'd imagine for a stereotypical californian. Try to aim for more general american accent references, and maybe more male references?

Probable aspergers and borderline mild-to-severe autism. Consistently in the 30th percentile in autism tests.
Still not fucking diagnosed, so I can be given NEETbux and be excused from work forever.
Though I have long been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I also came to love being a hermit.
The lockdown was by far the best time of my otherwise miserable adult life.

aspergers
I'm quite afraid of getting bipolar, people with autism have a relatively high likelihood of getting it and it can develop at any age so I'll never be out of the woods.
The same is true for epilepsy, which has much higher rates than bipolar again, but for that the chance gets significantly lower past a certain age that I'm past.
So far I've been relatively lucky in that I have few if any of the things that are common for people with autism to get, it's a pretty pure issue so at least that's something

Fuck, I miss it bro. No NEETbux appointments for 16 months. It was heaven. Going back to appointments for a year was awful.
Though they got much harsher, it finally spurred me to apply for 'limited capability', which I got for a year. Just about as good as the lockdown.
I just dread the next assessment in July. I need this autism diagnosis to make it easier to stay as I am now. I wish they'd leave me on it and forget me.
What's bad is that I never realised I was an autist until I wage-cucked for a year at 28-29. I passed the apprenticeship, but it became a living hell.

ive never been diagnosed or received neetbux in January 2020 I began working some shitty job. In March 2020 it shut down cause of COVID. I preceded to then collect unemployment, COVID checks, and tax returns for a year and a half-ish. built a pc and saved/invested the rest (still have most of it). Good times. Only problem is I got used to being alone again and so I barely hang out with my friend anymore . They want to hang out but staying home 24/7 is fucking bliss I'm sorry

I'm not diagnosed for Schizoid personality disorder, until then I'm just the average guy with avoidant attachment style all of this thanks to the people from my family, schools, teachers, friends and coworkers who messed up my mental health since i was literally 1 year old, glad i turned out to be a good person in the end i guess.

I went through about 15 years of appointment and mandatory course hell. I really needed that lockdown break.
I think if someone has been on unemploymentbux for over 15 years then there must be something seriously wrong with them (i.e. autism, which has an ~80% unemployment rate). Though I always put on a good show for them in appointments, even I think it is ridiculous to keep going like it's normal. Though I am very used to it, it is indeed a terrifying prospect and that was when they were somewhat lax. I thought every appointment was the final one and I would be made homeless. It felt even worse after both my folks died. In the several years since the apprenticeship I had to keep reiterating to them that I cannot deal with customers or phones without sperging out and this nopes me out of almost all jobs in this piece of shit service economy, which is being gutted by the Red Chinese. During the lockdown, I also got extra money which enabled me to regular eat hot food. I was also able to save up a lot of money, though I had to drop almost all of it on a new laptop when my main one got too old and my stand-in laptop broke down permanently.
Though I had times in my life where I tried to socialise, no-one really cared that much. I have two friends left and I rarely see them. They have busy lives anyway. I also had shit back in the day when threats were made against me by a local gang of brothers, so I barely went outside from 18-23. By the time I got over it, the Second Depression was in full swing and I knew I'd be pushing 30 before I even had a chance to wage-cuck; then I found out I was too fucked in the head to ever make it. There is no place for me in this shit economy. I made my peace with NEETing and basically embraced being a hermit. The inceldom is the least of it. I just want them to pay my pittance of a subsistence and leave me alone forever. UBI cannot come soon enough - I'd be able to live the lockdown forever, until the sweet release of death.

I was diagnosed to have an "Autism Spectrum Disorder." Not fitting the standard characterizations of what used to be called Aspergers' or High Functioning Autism.

Would allergies count as as one? From what I understand, they're all in the mind, right?

Severe anxiety and moderately severe depression circa a year ago when I got diagnosed
Still have both, but they're a lot more tolerable now that I went through behavioral counseling and psychotherapy.
Bonus points for meds, too.
I know it's not an illness but I'm also like 80% sure I'm on the autism spectrum in some way, but I never got diagnosed because ehh i don't really care that much and I don't want to deal with doctors anymore
My main goal in life now is to just be low-key, keep to myself, and save up money

I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Never took my meds however, I feel mostly fine nowadays.
I read some stuff about schizoid personality disorder and it seemed like a very accurate description of me. It also didn't sound like a disorder to me (as opposed to a personality type) so whatever.
As a kid/teenager I probably had a bunch more diagnoses but nobody is around who would know what those might have been.
I don't really intend to seek medication or therapy and getting labels doesn't feel that helpful for getting on with life so I try not to worry about it too much. The anxiety at one time was really fucking me up though, healthcare system was entirely useless for that as well. Best to assume you'll have to handle all of it yourself, that way you won't feel as disappointed when you try to reach out for help which is not given.

something between schizoid/avoidant
depression/anxiety (is this even a diagnosis anymore I think everyone is depressed and anxious)
probably autism
possibly bipolar
all self diagnosed thank you very much
<comment>
Schizoid here, I'm happy when I'm alone, I feel like a fish in the water when going to meditation silent retreats, and sometimes i do retreats on my own in a totally dark room. I start to feel the need to talk to people after a month or two of not contacting anyone.

Severe OCD and severe depression. I just spent six months not being able to touch anything, not even my "dirty" computer, because I thought my hands weren't even clean enough to touch dirty things. Now that I'm back on my computer, I'm finding that I can't get comfortable in my computer chair and I can't enjoy anything I used to do on the computer, like gaming or watching YouTube. After spending maybe one or two hours on my computer, I just want to go back to sleep. If I'm playing a game and I encounter a spot where I don't know where to go, I give up immediately. I have no patience for anything or joy in anything.

Do something for someone else. Helping others makes you feel fulfilled in ways that are hard to describe.

I already tried that and I only grew more resentful because for all that I've done for everyone else, no one (I can't empathize this enough: NO ONE) did anything for me when I needed it. Never again.

People only want you when you have something they need. They only wanna use you basically, youre not missing out on anything.

Wish I knew. Every single day feels like a curse. Every second I am alive just feels like my own personal perdition, as if I committed some unspeakable wrong in a past life and am reaping the divine consequences now. Too cowardly to face the unknown though, so I'll go on living like this for another fifty or so years.

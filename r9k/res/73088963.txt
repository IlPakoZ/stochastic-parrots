overheard some girls in the breakroom where i work laughing about some texts/dms one of them got. laughing at what was said and use of emojis saying it was gay, stuff like that. it got me thinking: how do you text foids? hitting the gym, good job etc. all that does not do much if you have no social skills particularly over text. especially if you want to try dating apps. not all of you are stone cold incels/wizards so how would you go about fixing this? where do you find females(female) to talk to for practice? general tips on hiding power level, not being an autist. this is not neceserally just for dating, there are a fuckload of women in hr and stuff, being more charismatic will probably help with job interviews also

like i want a bf but not so much that i'd date an ugly guy
everyone's shallow because attraction is nature and nature is shallow
Imagine being this desperate for attention. Op is a lonely, ugly male
In heaven all of your dreams will come true.
I'm like that too. I'd rather be alone that to be with an ugly girl
I like it when white people transcend my sticky earlobes.
Try being interesting. I have enough jokes to last 3 months. And then make funny on-the-spot comments that aren't memorized. Do a funny dance and a fun loving guy will find you.

i would date an ugly guy bc i am attracted to ugly men
what the hell is wrong with u?
a lot of things but liking ugly men is probably one of the more minor things that is wrong with me
Why specifically ugly men though?
what type of ugly man do you like, care to give an example?
its incredibly rare for me to find a conventionally attractive man, actually attractive. i can acknowledge they look nice but yeah, wouldnt ever date one. ugly is a bit of broad descriptor because id date an average looking man too 
overweight, facial hair, not the best style of dress, big nose maybe, idk just not attractive. i find it hard to genuinely describe anyone as ugly, but my friends have said my type in men is "ugly neckbeard" so

Anyone here work from home for an online job?
They seem hard to get but infinitely better than going to work every day. 
Being able to stay at home, is nice, but could be one of the last things I care about. If I could go and be in some room without anyone talking to me then sure, I just refuse to go and bow down to a boss and forced to be all fake and tell him how much I want to dedicate my soul to the company. And I'm just chill I'm not like a manipulator who can go in an interview and convince them I deserve the job or whatever.

Only men can be truly bisexual, as I'm a bi male and I've talked to my bi male friends about this topic
What we discovered is 85% of a woman is straight and only 15% is truly gay and that in turn makes them technically bisexual 
but they have a greater preference and desire for men and or cocks 
What we also discovered is that women are romantically lesbian or bisexual, meaning that they can be romantically attracted 
to a woman but still prefer men or are more sexually attracted to men than women
Only bisexual men are actually sexually attracted to both at around the same degree
Although, romantic attraction differs between us, me and my friends that is, some are romantically attracted to women and others men
The whole straight-iarchy myth about bisexual men being fully gay or gay in denial is bullshit. We're already admitting we like cock 
so if we were really worried why would we say we like physical male features at all? Wouldn't it make sense to stay in the closet or go full gay 
since most people assume bisexual guys are submissive bottoms anyways
Bisexual women are the same as "experimenting women", it's redundant. They never marry or have long relationships with women; 
they are only bi in the sense that they are attracted to other women to some degree but not enough for it to be 50/50 and 
definitely not enough to be a real bisexual

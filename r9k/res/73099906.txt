How long could you endure webm related before begging for it to stop? Let's say there's a money incentive. Go through several hours of this for $10,000.
i can endure fire for a long time, i dont think id fold
Not very long at all. My feet are super tickelish. I accidentally always kick the women who do my pedicures on accident lmao.
I'm not ticklish, so until my legs get too numb from their fatass sitting on me.
How did you develop this skill?
Are you a boy or a girl anon? If you're male, do people find it weird when you go to get pedicures?
eventually you would get used to it, right? your brain just stops seeing it as a threat or bugs or whatever
id just keep my wrist right above a candle until i couldnt take it anymore
A skilled tickler prevents this by alternating between different techniques and levels of intensity. Sometimes the worst feeling is when they are not tickling you, but when you don't know when they will.
Im a girl, but I wouldnt think its that weird for a guy to get a pedicure. I used to give my ex them, not put polish on or anything just trim his cuticles, shape his nails, and remove any dead skin.

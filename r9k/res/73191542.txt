Cope with the fact that attractive men can easily have relationships with women
Only if they are socially competent and not mentally ill.
Cope even gl mentally ill men can
i cope
socially competent 
Socially not retarded. The bar isn't that high.
Only a few mental illnesses will stop you from getting laid.
With video games, consumerism and pornography.
This board is proof that the bot does fuck all and that people will just continually reword the same phrases for all eternity rather than come up with something new.
What can you come up with? It's fucking over ever. Ever since you were born most major life events and your destiny were already decided by your genetics. If you are a normie or above you can play easily and win at life. If you are sub 5 you get nothing. Maybe some leftovers. At the end of the day you will miss out on sex, young love and friendship, become a wageslave for the rest of your life and work without any reward or thank you. And if you decide to say something about it you are evil and negative.
Relationships with half attractive women aren't easily attained for anyone unless they're rich. Attractive guys still have to work their asses off to date decent looking girls and put up with loads of bullshit.
Also, what counts as incel anyway? I haven't gotten laid since before the pandemic. But I also haven't tried because I can't stand people anymore.

Firstly, marble races are a pure form of competition because they are based solely on the physical abilities of the marbles. Unlike other forms of competition where external factors such as politics, finance, and resources can influence the outcome, marble races are purely physical. The marbles have no influence over the race track, and the winner is simply the marble that performs the best. This makes it a fair competition where the best athlete wins, and the winner is determined purely on merit.
Secondly, marble races are a great way to settle disputes because they are non-violent and non-destructive. Many major disputes in society, whether they are geopolitical, economic or social, are often resolved through violent means. Wars, sanctions, and protests are all examples of ways in which societies have historically resolved disputes. These methods often result in lots of destruction. Marble races provide a non-violent and non-destructive way to settle disputes. By using marble races, societies can avoid the loss of life, destruction, and economic ruin that come with violent means of dispute resolution.
Thirdly, marble races promote teamwork and cooperation. Marble races often involve teams of marbles, each with their unique strengths and abilities. These teams must work together to ensure that their marbles perform at their best, and ultimately to win the race. The same teamwork and cooperation can be applied to society's major disputes. By competing in marble races, societies can learn to work together, collaborate, and solve problems in a way that benefits everyone.
In conclusion, marble races are a pure form of competition that can avoid the loss of life, destruction, and economic ruin that often come with violent means of dispute resolution. Additionally, marble races promote teamwork and cooperation, which can benefit society in the long run. It may seem like a radical idea, but it could be the solution to many of society's problems.

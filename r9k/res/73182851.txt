Be me
Go to sleep
Find out I'm India with my friends and we have to take a train to Australia
We're basically running and passing by ancient buildings to get to the train that will somehow transport us from India to Australia
See we have a kangaroo companion that wants to help us
Kangaroos starts running with us
We come across this barbershop and he says he's actually an attorney
We magically teleport to Australia
We're in the outback on some random farm
There are lots of bulls and cows in the farm
We start sprinting towards the bulls and cows and start beating them
Kangaroo bro starts helping us
The cows and bulls start to overwhelm us
Me and my friends just barely escaped
Kangaroo bro is dead
I feel sad
We start to walk and see a random glove that I lost when I was working my wage slave job
I try to get the glove
Wake up
Still feel bad for my kangaroo bro

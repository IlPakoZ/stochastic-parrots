Be me
At airport
Flying back home from a robotics competition
Get bored so I whip out my laptop to watch hockey
Random group of students comes to the gate
Kid asks me if he can sit next to me
I say sure
He starts watching the game with me and we start talking about hockey for a while
Turns out his dad is the assistant GM of an NHL team
He asks me why I'm traveling and I explain robotics to him
He sees very interested and I'm very happy that he's interested 
About to board
He asks me if I want some jellybeans so I gratefully accept
He thanks for me for letting him watch the game with me
That encounter made my week after a lot of disappointment. I kinda wonder if that'll be a core memory for him down the line

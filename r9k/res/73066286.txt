How fucked am I?
Not fucked at all unless it was something illegal. If you think it was a virus, it wouldn't do anything unless you downloaded it completely and ran it yourself. If it was something illegal, you're kind of fucked. Sorry, bro.
What was even the filename of what you were downloading..? Are you sure you weren't just accidentally downloading the webpage or something?
Even if the download never finished and I didn't see what was on the file?
wtf is anonfiles and why would clicking the site logo cause illegal stuff to start downloading
are you 14?

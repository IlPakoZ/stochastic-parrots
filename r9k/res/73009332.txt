How do I become a neet? And what do I do about money?
Scream at a wall and go to a psych ward. Maybe shit on the floor at work for good measure.
You don't; everyone who claims to be a NEET is a liar, in reality the governments of the world hunt down and rounds up all NEETs and puts them all into a big witches cauldron.
then pick it up and put it in the toilet
keep muttering to yourself things like "poo goes in loo" and "clean it up jannie"

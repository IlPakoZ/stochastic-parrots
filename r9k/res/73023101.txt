Ya know, the internet was a lot more peaceful when there wasn't so many trans fuckers on the platform
God I want the internet back to where it was.

Trannies are the same people who were posting here before. A large percentage of nerdy, autistic men becoming trans is a symptom of the problem, not the cause.

I'm not talking about 4chan. I'm talking about YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, that shit

Even there, it's usually the nerdy, autistic men who decide they're trannies and not the regular people. Nerdy, autistic men were the ones who founded those communities in the first place. They are being pitted against each other, rather than being pitted against some outside adversary, say normalfags or corporations who are taking over unnoticed while everyone's busy fighting each other over irrelevant bullshit.

Yeah and they're twice as weird, fucked up and old than they were then. Hence the problem

I seem to remember being introduced to trans porn on /b/ in 2006. When exactly are you referring to?

Pleb taste. The old internet was great because it was such unfiltered weirdness. It wasn't until the neurotypical sports-watching crowd got smartphones that we have to hear daily how mad they are at weird people for existing. I hear 50x as much rage against trans than I do trans people doing or saying anything.
If Baily Jay pissed you off in 07, you would have been the weird one here and told to fuck off.

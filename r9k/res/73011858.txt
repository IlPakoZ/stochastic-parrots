if you were sedated after giving birth and your husband named your kids daffy and donald (after the worlds most amazing ducks) would you be upset with him? isn't it unreasonable to go for divorce over something like that when they're really cool names to begin with?
<comment>
you can change their names later dumbass
<comment>
but what if the husband really wanted to keep their really cool names, hypothetically speaking, but the wife was threatening divorce if he did.
<comment>
not naming your duck child Dolan
NGMI
<comment>
change those to their middle names and give them real first names or something idk 
if you cant compromise over this your kids have no chance at all
<comment>
right so we can give them lame middle names and keep the awesome amazing first names instead. shouldn't she compromise as well? are you a simp? Xander and MacKenzie are not as good first names.
<comment>
bro one of them is a girl?
kek, those poor children, you're going to be a terrible father
<comment>
Daffy ends with a -y so it can be a boy or girl name. Donald is the boys name. I tried telling her that Mac in MacKenzie can make it sound like a boys name too so there's no room to say that about Daffy.
<comment>
daffy stands for uhhhh daffodil :3 daft dill. strange babby.
if he wanted to name the baby donald well... we don't have to talk about donald
<comment>
I'd divorce you too desu what a shitty thing to do
<comment>
I seriously don't understand how you got someone to procreate with you
<comment>
giving your kids cool names is shitty? how? is giving them dumb names like Xander and MacKenzie also shitty?
<comment>
theyre not cool names anon, they will be target practice in school
<comment>
be a literal baby
your dad names you fucking Daffy and your brother Donald
I'm sure they just can't wait for the 3rd grade bullying on the playground.
<comment>
Target practice for who? People who hate awesome names? They're pretty much the coolest ducks ever. People will want to be friends with them. The only downside I can think of is that I was going to give them both the middle name Duck so people could be like "holy crap thats cool" when they say their names but out of compromise i let their dumb middle names be Xander and MacKenzie
<comment>
This. Don't be retarded anon. Those names are goofy as shit and WILL get your kids bullied. Do what's right for them and just name them normal fucking names.
<comment>
anon, do you really expect your own children to go through middle and high school being known as "the kids with the goofy ass names"? what about their professional career? do you expect any normal employer to read the name "daffy" and not think "what the hell?"
your wife is threatening to divorce you because you're about to give your children horrible lives due to your total and complete lack of empathy
<comment>
You were mindful enough with what you were doing to do it while your wife was sedated even when I am sure you have discussed the topic before. That's more reason to divorce than any retard autism name you could've picked.
<comment>
How can an adult man this retarded be allowed to breed. Good fucking luck, anons kids, you're gonna need it.
<comment>
Donald Glover? Donald Trump? Donald IS a normal name. Daffy is a unique name for a girl and will make her popular.
<comment>
You make it sound evil but its no worse than if a single mother doesnt inform the dad she's giving birth and names her kids without him.
<comment>
I miss autistic threads like these. God bless you OP
<comment>
Not when your middle name is duck and your brothers name is daffy. Obviously it's the better of the two but c'mon you can't be that retarded to see how it'd be a bad choice in this scenario.
<comment>
You make it sound like that example isn't also a vile thing to do anon, not helping your case.
<comment>
She is threatening to divorce me because she hates Duck Tales and Looney Tunes. She would never even watch them with me even though i kept trying to get her into them. Couldn't even get her to wear the duck suits.
<comment>
coolest names ever
Get out of your own retarded head and think about it from somebody else's perspective. God. No wonder your wife wants to leave you.
<comment>
its literally the norm, a hundred million kids were named that way. nothing vile or abnormal or about it. It WOULD be vile to destroy a perfectly happy family because of a weird hatred for ducks.
<comment>
naming your children after an autistic cartoon and thinking it's a good idea
I really, really hope this thread is a joke.
<comment>
Out of my head? okay i'm seeing it from the perspective of future friends they hear the name and go "whoa that's wicked"
<comment>
In no way is that the norm what? You've pushed the larp too far anon last (you) make it count.
<comment>
i don't get the hatred for some of the most culturally groundbreaking cartoons ever made. i took down the posters for her, i threw away the plushies and even took down the big porch plushy so the neighbors (who had never complained btw) would think we're "normal". she's too obsessed with what other people think instead of focusing on the family.
<comment>
weird hatred for ducks
If you honestly can't see the true reason for why your wife is upset you probably should not breed...
<comment>
if that's what she thought she wouldnt have had kids with me. maybe its postpartum psychosis thats making her all worked up for no reason.
<comment>
They're either gonna say nothing and laugh behind closed doors or tell you straight up how retarded you are.
<comment>
No way in hell you're an actual person who has reproduced.
<comment>
no because they'll borrow my videotapes of original recordings of Duck Tales and once they see it they'll be blown away
<comment>
Daffy and Donald are wonderful names for your children :) You should name you children that. Your wife is being unfair and irrational. The people telling you otherwise are delusional and autistic. Your kids deserve such great names. They will likely receive compliments for their names their entire lives :) Name your children Daffy and Donald
<comment>
yeah she got passive aggressive like this during the argument too. its not that big of a deal.
<comment>
You're larping dawg I seriously doubt even autists have thought processes similar to yours
<comment>
we don't talk about donald no moe
<comment>
based enabler
<comment>
His wife's suggestions are worse. At least OP gave his son a normal name.

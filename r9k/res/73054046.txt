For example, you see men who fetishize disabled women, obese women, dwarf women, muscular women, women without teeth even... but there's not a single group of women into incel men?
Part of it is that women in general are pickier than men, there's a lot of push by women for men to accept a more diverse range of women but vice versa is seen as sexist and entitled
But part of it is also that dating apps just have way more men than women. At times these apps have like 80% men. When that's the case, 6/10 definitely isn't going to cut it
No. You are unlovable
Do you think it's cultural or just genetic?
they wouldn't be incel then and it would be incredibly rude of women to deprive them of their community, just for some quick fuck
I don't want a community. I want to be loved by a woman

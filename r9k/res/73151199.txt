post stories of your ineptitude with the opposite sex
I'll start
Continued>
Cont.
everytime I see her she wants to talk to me to see how I am
Ok no green text for this bit. She had this way of standing there; she could be kinda awkward but God so cute. She'd stand there fidgeting with her finger looking with these eyes that asked a million questions. Man can't even describe it properly. Like she was waiting for me to tell her what was happening and what she could do to help. Anyway..
in my mind we were never dating

do you have skin flaps in your belly?
it receded mostly
Got some faint stretch marks though
oh ok, to be honest, this board, or this website even, isn't the best place to ask for advice if that's what you're asking for, I don't know there doesn't seem to be a question on the thread you posted.
Just a thread for venting 
Anyone can post their experience
cool, so what are your hobbies?
I wish I even had some experiences with the opposite sex but girls don't even think I exist.
Hikes, restoring tools, gardening
You could make it so they do
like removing the rust from it, shit like that?
Oh believe me I've tried and I am far from an ugly manlet too. And still it's like I don't exist. I guess my personality is just not lovable.
How?
Yeah and sharpening them, replacing parts ect
It helps to be bombasic and not really care
I do that and girls love it. Of course inwardly it's a different story but hey it gets their attention 
Personal grooming is big too
Im like you but younger bro. Used to be ugly but I had a glow up but still never caught up socially. 18 now, getting female attraction and I dont know what to do with it or how to express my feelings to girls. Im scared Im never going to get a gf because Im scared to talk to the hoes.
I groom myself but it doesnt really help that I have an acne ridden ugly face does it. And idk how to act bombastic lol. I cant pull it off.
Wish I had some better consolation dude
I'm 22 now and admittedly I hate myself less than I used to
So I guess time helps 
Still a long way to go
be me, new in college. Relentlessly bullied and friendless in high school with abusive parents, never felt love before.

I feel like they are literally trying to bait me into befriending them so they can bully me and make fun of me more.
tl;dr:
Im almost 30, ex-infantry, pretty fucking shredded(no homo), and thought I had outgrown by beta upbringing via hard work but turns out im still just a bitch getting bullied by a fucking 5 foot tall teenage girl just like in high school
They probably think you're hot dude
Don't be like me and get caught in your own head
Just own it
I never fucked, dated, hanged out with, or befriended women. I don't have any stories to share.
Either they want you or theyre assholes either way avoid them dont risk it
me again, this is from before the other story
im shy :/
memes aside you are literally autistic and retarded
Is this copy pasta? I've seen this near exact thing written before.
mate..
This is agony to read
I might have been oblivious once but this is next level
You're clearly a good looking guy a d girls like you. Just try it on with one of them!
Unless you think this is some gender spanning conspiracy targeting you exclusively (which it isn't)
Sorry to sound Nd look Ike a hypocrite but it's so grating to hear someone making the exact same fuckups as I did
Well, you've managed to hang out with girls that like you. I don't even know where to begin when it comes to asking a friendly girl to just hang out.
Found it, it's been posted more times than I thought: https://desuarchive.org/r9k/search/text/haha%20anon%20are%20you%20scared%20to%20make%20eye%20contact%20with%20me/
ive literally considered that before, debated if there was some sort of group chat all these gals were in(this spans years and all different parts of the country) to make fun of me or something, logically it is "crazy' i know but I cant help be consider it lol
im good looking but very autistic and retarded
damn got me good
Did you type this again or copy it from when you posted it on your own thread?
Cuz typing all that for a second time is CRAZY (im lazy)
girls open me on dating apps all the time but after a few messages they stop responding once they realize im not smooth and NT
also i was molested by an old fat lady when I was a kid and cry when I try to fuck if I dont take drugs... but i dont really feel like that was a big factor in things
wait....are they literally doing this?
Like they are shoving their asses at you?
lmao you are a disgrace
Bro you have 0 rizz (i think btw)
How do you even text like this? Is it on purpose? ahahahahahahahahah
Pic for proof
you can see her collar on the floor....
idk how it got like this bros
literally hundreds of them, these are a few and I have a lot more 
idk
women b crazy yo!
Dude that bitch is about to murder you.
Just fuck somebody else
logistics lol
This is actually hilarious, you're a Chad bro. What ended up happening to this girl?
long read but tl;dr:
unhinged
GET OFF THE BOARD. THIS IS A TRUCEL BOARD
holy fuck... bro
i simply didn't know what to say so i let it fizzle out... i don't know what she's doing today. she's not that active on socials and i wouldn't dare to contact her or her acquaintances again to find out.
anyways, my chubiness turned in to fully fledged obesity but luckily i've been able to lose weight back to normal and today i'm even lighter and more fit than on high school and signed up to local boxing gym. yet still i'm suffering the same case as op does. i'm fit, somewhat slightly above average looking, noticing those mires, stares and looks but inside of me is still a broken fat guy with no confidence.
Was a she or a he? I'm confused, whose gift was it?
run retard
trust me
I'm just as confused, he didn't make sense.
What? your crush was a tranny? I don't get it
What is it you're looking for exactly? I don't know if you're as good looking as my friend, but in certain environments women have pretty much molested him. If you are just looking for some sex/validation, this might interest you.
just a normal relationship of two people going through their lives together would be nice. but that's too idealistic to demand from this world anyways.
i wouldn't consider myself as conventionally attractive. like, 6/10, slightly above average, as mentioned. also i've been an obese shit for most of my life, especially after the high school when my depression got really unhinged. few women told me i have some kind of specific charisma around me. also i'm getting compliments about my deeper voice (thanks, i still hate it).
but despite getting to normal weight, becoming somewhat jacked and having other parts of my life solved or on a good track (like career, savings, owning a home), i still see myself as a fat shit unworthy of kindness, love and affection. so instead i live a solitary hermit life.
I've told the story too many times of the cute chubby Asian girl that hit on me for a semester. It was a photography class and I gave her a spare film camera to use. So she started talking to me. One day she was poking me leg, working closer and closer to my crotch then poked my dick. I didn't do a God damn thing but laugh and keep working. Last day of class she takes me phone from me. I panic and chase her down, violently grab her hand, and rip it out of her hand. I didn't want her to see my stupid photos who knows what else. Well she looked at me, and saw what I really was. It was over. I didn't return to college the next semester
How old are you if I may ask and do you at least have pets?
Did you forget end your message saying love tai?
He's just like me fr, fr...
It isn't over anon, it never even began for us.
why's that? you sound like the type of guy women were throwing themselves at.
Nah, this story was just a lucky occurrence. I was way too shy I guess. A waste really
yeah, but you ended up with other girls right?
Yeah I did end up fucking a landwhale to gain some confidence. It was either that or the part to wizardry
path to wizardry*
but wasn't she a stepping stone for you in the end? if i had to guess, you've slept with 10+ women by now.
ur halfway there fren :)
Yeah, I definitely viewed her as a stepping stone at the time for sure but the funny thing is that I regret it. She was much better than the other girls both in bed and as a person. I really should have encouraged her to improve herself and lose some weight but I just didn't give a fuck.
Tho she did end up fucking some nigger a few years later so maybe she was unsalvageable.
How was she better? Was there anything you found attractive about her physically? I always hear guys call girls land whales or hamplanets, but they still usually have really big tits or ass which are a real turn on us.
*real turn on for us.
I have only had one positive interaction with a female in my entire life, it is so disjointed from the rest of my life that it felt like a dream
It's like my one lucky break. My one moment of glory. It is my most cherished memory. Sometimes i lay in bed and recall the moment so i don't forget it. I will never kill myself because some day she could return to that pier maybe. Good things do happen sometimes. Those 3 sentences are firever etched in my mind.
Physically she was fucking trash man...she did have big tits but no ass and her face was nothing special. Legit 2/10. First attempt I couldn't get it up and we left it at that till next morning.
However she was so good in bed that I ended up seeing her for 6 months or so. Always horny, talkative, always willing to try anything, could take the initiative or be submissive, gave a mean head. I regret not going full degenerate on her, she just wouldn't say no
so it was just the sex and not her you liked?
At the time yes, I also liked that she would cook for me I guess lmao.
However years later I realised that she is the person I connected with the most. She was fun to hang around, very easy to talk to, somewhat funny for a girl and she really did care. 
Truth be told I would never officially date her if she didn't lose some weight but like I said I should have shown her some support
You'll get your chance again, just need to create more opportunities.
Yeah, i'll probably just freeze up like i did back then haha. In retrospect, it's a good thing that she left immediately, because she would probably be disgusted with how much of a sperg i am.
Why are we all autizmo
Just become a lifeguard and meet some qts, anon. If you are as skilled as I'm lead to believe you could probably become one fairly quickly.
This is obviously a Nagatoro fan episode
No lifeguards where i live. This isnt baywatch lol. But yeah, i'm a pretty good swimmer.
Why lie to me? Any place that has pools accessible to the public legally requires them.
Can't relate, I'm a total fuck-up and not even good looking imo but somehow I always managed to blunder my way into dating and relationships, for the most part.
Biggest blunder was one girl I knew in freshman year of college. She always hung out with me in every class we had together, in hindsight mighta been flirting a little, awesome porcelain skin, blue eyes, red died shortish hair. 
Nice tits.
Woulda fucked raw really given the chance but nothing really came of it, I never just went for it.
There was also this other hot AF girl I knew around college. Don't know why because IMO she was out of my league, but she always seemed friendly with me even though we only knew each other through some peripheral mutuals, and never any of the same lectures. 
In hindsight I could have probably got something there to if I played my cards right.
Some Indian girl I realized years later was in her awkward 4chan-autist style way flirting with me. I think? 
And some various others I could have probably made something happen.
Anyway, point is, bros if you're obsessing over this shit, don't put women on a pedestal. And stop making them the centre of your existence and hanging your self worth up on them. 
Dating has never been harder, the effects of social media and other social trends has never made the competition tougher, and you're competing with women's own unrestrained hypergamy, or as we used to call it, delusional standards.
Like, work on your appearance and social skills, but mostly just treat women like normal human beings and develop a light playful dgaf attitude to life, at least around women. They can smell desperation, it's like vaginal desiccant.
My town doesn't have a pool... that's why i go to the seaside every year. Plus, i hate pools, they smell like shit and piss
You're not shy, nigga, you're some kinda retarded autistic.
This reads like those Reddit "what obvious sign from a girl did you miss?" posts.
One of my worst
My fucking face when I realized what she was doing like years later
Yeah been there, run.
I'm actually in tears, lol. She literally delivers herself to you on your bed and you still say no. Doesn't matter though, sounds like getting girls is stupid easy for you.
Sometimes the problem with autismus isn't the social ineptitude, it's the total overreactions to ultimate non-events.

Pretty sure he's just ESL. My gf is ESL and she confuses he/she all the time because her native language doesn't distinguish them
I remember fucking a girl that was fat in all the wrong places. I literally had to access some deep seated animal mode to fuck her. Not the part of the brain for when you lose all cotrol and smash a 10/10, no, some other bit a man in the face of life or death odds delves to power through a situation. The rage in the face of a storm. The sheer bravado a man needs to charge down an armed assailant. To sprint through live fire. 
Plus for her was it was the best fuck of her life because I returned to monke and she liked it wild. 
Bad news for me is it was mostly performative since I didn't really find her attractive so some of the most disappointing nuts I've ever had. I've had lazy fap sessions that were more exciting.
How come? You were in the army, which would force you to constantly interact with other people.
Since I will get conscripted next year, I was hoping that being forced to interact with my fellow man would fix my high social inhibition. But it seems that it may not do that.

I just want to become Nosferatu Zodd and then spend my days hunting human beings and destroying things like factories and off shore driving platforms
It feels like I missed one key piece of info that fucked it up. It annoys me on a more problem-solving level than anything else.
She probably said "Want to go back to my place?" which you misheard as a question about a German beer, and replied "No", not thinking anything of it
I'm wondering if something happened between her asking you to hang out and you showing up to the bar. Like some sort of message she tried to send to you that you didn't pick up on.
quick question, when you take these screenshots does she ever like ask tf you're doing and how do you respond?
this is the type of shit that makes me not wanna try and make moves anymore
soon to be 34. and no pets. i cope with tons of activities and leaving pet home alone just for few hours of companion that fully dependends on me would be selfish
Deadpan autist reporting in. I don't care about relationships and have never actively wanted one, I'm just notoriously oblivious since I don't think that way by default and people like to laugh at it. So here you go. No greentext for this one, only confession of shame.
Once upon a time, I had a shit life and it really fucked me up. Got pointed to therapy which was mostly useless since that therapist and I weren't the best fit, but I WAS encouraged to try to make friends. Approached a fellow fuckup and she attacked me with a sharp object, so that's a good start. It was a one-off since she was at her fucking limit at the time, and I know that feel so whatever. We ended up hanging out and became friends. You know, talking online, reading books, her almost accidentally setting my kitchen on fire, that sort of thing. Since we were both damaged goods, we understood how it be and helped one another with occasional trauma episodes. I acted as a jerk-bouncer when she started experimenting with normal social shit like dating, though that was infrequent and they rarely seemed to go past the first one. Figured it was her general discomfort with that sort of thing, and eventually it stopped altogether. She never seemed fully happy, though.
Long story short, I was close friends with this girl for 9 years and didn't notice she was into me for around 7 of them, despite all of the signs being there. My brain just glossed it over as her usual quirks. We're very similar and that made me kind of take her feelings for granted, I think? And that made it too awkward to say anything since there's a bit of a cultural thing at play. When she finally got too upset about it, snapped and just spelled it out for my dumb ass, I felt like a massive fucking dick for not noticing and making her feel bad for that long without knowing.
I also have workplace autism stories if anyone wants them. Those are more silly.
What building?
Shit I have a few

Girl 3
And now I'm out of college and completely WASTED my best years. It hurts.
Now there is another girl from Discord who I actually managed to ask out and am meeting soon. Hopefully I won't fuck up this chance
I threw up one time at concert and went right back out to hit on this girl. I was so drunk I couldn't tell she was trying not speak to me.
A small mall I still frequent in my hometown. Its been a few years since then though, I never saw the girl after that. She was my first love too :(
There's one specific house party I was at at around 17 or 18 where I almost certainly could have kicked off a normal-ish sex life and from that alone massively diverged from the path I was on.
Girl had been flirting with me for weeks. She was kinda weird, kinda vaguely goth-y and my friends were not quiet about thinking she was gross - but, like, I absolutely should have said fuck it and taken what I could get. Big tits go a long way with me.
Anyways, like, weeks and weeks go by of her going out of her way to talk to me, getting close, being touchy, what have you. There's one specific moment where, in retrospect, she may as well have said "Do you like my tits?" - end of the day at this Catholic school, and she's unbuttoning her uniform shirt in front of me to reveal a tight, low-cut tank and at some point during this brief conversation gets close enough to press them against me. I give her just absolutely nothing, partially out of this deep spergy conviction I'm somehow being messed with and partially because I'm friends with these dudes who can afford to have standards leagues above my own, and don't have the balls to be like "Fuck you guys I wanna get my dick touched".
Cut to the party, everyone's drunk the way you can only get off vodka you stole from your parents and didn't mix with anything. Same girl finds me having taken a seat on the couch, and promptly sits on my fucking lap and is talking to me like inches from my face. Definitely could have kissed her, definitely could have taken her upstairs and done more if I had.
Instead, I just went completely fucking catatonic and just straight up ignored her, sort of pretending to have the spins or whatever, until she finally gave up, pounced on some other dude, and basically never spoke to me against after that, pretty understandably.
This particular coworker girl loved to watch this these things happen, and I was apparently regular entertainment for her whenever we worked together. Her sharing this shit in the staff room all the time is partially why everyone else who worked there thought I was "funny" and teased me over it. Thankfully the workplace flirting was restricted to 2-3 girls only and it was just to mess with me, so I know they probably weren't serious. I think.
...so, social ineptitude?
I dont simp over random women and i'm also not a social retard. But ive also been alone save for a few best friends over the years. 
I guess it all started because i would rather be alone that suffer when trying to fit in with people i have nothing in common with. 
Anyway my only regret was this really bubbly pixie girl who made it obvious she liked me, which causee her friends to force me to confess to her. I have never felt so sick as then and for the first few times in my life i spoke fast and stuttered. It all went well of course but at this point I was such a sigma male (kissless hugless virgin) that I was disturbed by affection and so even though she asked to hug me constantly I would slip away and deflect her affection . Whenever she waved to me in the halls I would ignore her and she would get the most dejected look. After she said that there were other guys that keep asking her to date and that she cant wait on me any longer I then didnt talk to her. Later my best friend at the time told her I wasnt talking to her because I hated her when I obviously never hated her, I had just been so used to being alone, that being with someone was weird to me.
In my cowardice I never explained her that I never hated her. Im still ashamed about that and hopefully I can fix things with her, its been about a year and i'm just procrastinating on it.
Wrong reply, meant to reply to op.
The image and reply attached to this was mean to be coupled with the caption 
lol
Didn't it bother you that she would keep sharing with everyone your blunders and what you were doing? I feel like I'm not being overly sensitive, but I would be pissed off and would want her to kind her own business.
If you have anymore stories you would like to share, pls do?
This was more brutal for her anon lol.

Kind of, but more in the way you'd get annoyed at your brother for eating your fridge snacks without asking. You can tell the difference between malice and someone taking the piss for social cohesion. It's like the woman version of banter, it can actually endear others to you. Plus it really is my own short-comings; poking fun at them doesn't make them any more or less real. Learning to accept them and laugh about it helps, and now I'm a little more aware. Sorta, maybe.

If you have anymore stories you would like to share, pls do?
Fuckton.
Brother, you must be one handsome dude for this to regularly happen to you. You have no interest in dating at all? Also, I'll take as many stories as you feel like sharing.
I actually have two addendums for the first of these two. Like our interactions were like this
we sit down in the library, and i notice some stain or something on her chair
And then this is the exact time when she basically gave up
tell her about it and she jumps up out of it
And then this is the exact time when she basically gave up
"is there anything on my pants?" 
And then this is the exact time when she basically gave up
she bends over the table a bit and presents her ass to me to check
And then this is the exact time when she basically gave up
very nice ass but i was too shy and worried, i should have given a compliment or something but did not
And then this is the exact time when she basically gave up
"yup, all good." 
And then this is the exact time when she basically gave up
later that week, she was sitting on the grass outside with some friends before coming to study with me
And then this is the exact time when she basically gave up
"can you check really quick if theres any grass stains for me?"
And then this is the exact time when she basically gave up
same thing again, this time shes wearinf tight leggings
And then this is the exact time when she basically gave up
I literally don't understand the message in the pic. What is she trying to say?
You have no interest in dating at all?
Never have, seems like a bother. I've gone back to full hikkineet since I can support that lifestyle now, so I just spend my time reading, working out and fucking with MCs. I'm not wholly against the idea, but the person would have to mesh just right since I need a ton of alone time. And yeah, sure. Mi suffering es su suffering.
Typing this one out kind of hurt.
Typing this one out kind of hurt.
Eh, I don't see why it should. You admit to having no interest in dating so it's not as if you are losing out on anything, right? 
What's this? Do you talk to your family at least? (Of course keep going if you're down, I'll pull up to the fireplace)
She was trying to add me as a friend on facebook and couldn't figure it out somehow, I never saw the message and she must have also assumed I did it on purpose
On a side note, now 10 years later I've overcome autism and set up my first date with someone bumble for tomorrow, wish me luck
I think I hate cyborgs more than normies honestly
Fuck off and go have sex
You're not Chad? If it really is your first date ever, I truly wish you the best of luck.
Nothing new or special
I'm here aren't I?
even if she takes one look at me and walks out I'll count it as a win
Eh, I don't see why it should. You admit to having no interest in dating so it's not as if you are losing out on anything, right?
It's not concerning myself, but the way she kind of internally deflated and left with a faux casual air. Then she never came back and I have no way to be sure it wasn't related. A lot of them do that. I hate being around people most times and I definitely don't wanna get in deep like that, but it doesn't mean I want to hurt them, either. It's easier when no one is around. Online is nice for that.
What's this?
Microcontrollers. I like building robots and stuff. Also been looking into AI and neural networks since it overlaps with several of my interests in general. The AI I've made previously obviously pale in comparison to what's being done now and I currently lack the raw hardware capabilities to train such large models anyway, but I suppose it's not out of the realm of possibility one day. Maybe start making the wAIfu thing a reality for you guys without the corporate censor. I'd just rather not drain too many of my assets at this point in time due to the questionable economic state of... uh, pretty much everywhere.
Do you talk to your family at least?
Absolutely not, and it's better that way. I have a grand total of 3 irl contacts whom I see only rarely and one is away for a year or two with real no way to talk to him until he gets back.
Nice, good luck, man. Make sure you shower and wear something that fits. You got this.
Yeah, but so are many Chads in this thread. If you read through the stories, you can tell by the way girls are throwing themselve at lightspeed. Definitely take the win, but don't give up either. Nothing has happened yet so it's still possible for things to turn out well. Would you make a post tomorrow about it for us? Ever see what that girl was up to these days?
Would you make a post tomorrow about it for us?
I'll do it for you, I'm expecting a pleasant chat (easy) then her saying she didn't feel the vibe over text and me realising I'm ok with being single forever (difficult). 
I don't read chadposting because I assume it's fake and also I don't relate so it's not worth it
It's after work but good advice
If you've EVER had a woman approach you, you need to leave this board immediately.
only a few months later i figured out what she was trying to do, it was so fucking obvious and i can't believe that i was so fucking dumb. don't regret anything btw because i didn't like her
Thank you : )
Based /fit/chad.

Is this pic from 4chan? I would really like to read the thread if possible?
Putting on colonge feels like I'm destroying what makes me me, and I am not the kind of person that wears cologne
I've dressed in the same style for the past 15 years, perhaps you can now see why I've been single this long
https://archived.moe/fit/thread/39046333
If you're worried about acting like a horny sperg, fap before you clean yourself up for the date to get it out of your system so you're not all geared up.
Thanks for finding the link for me
The stories in OP made it pretty clear the flavor of fuckups was not going to be conventional fare. There's a lot of kinds of autism that keeps people virgins, though I guess the catfucker guy is a cyborg. Make a thread only for stories about school humiliations, or go on the webring version of the board if it bothers you since it's reclusive and more about rejecting 3D and embracing autistic hobbies. Probably moves too slow for zoomers, though.
Are you still a virgin? Has your libido diminished?
jesus christ even at maximum teenage self loathing autism I'd have realized someone asking for pics of me with no top on and touching me wanted to fuck oh my god you absolute retard faggot I hope you die in real life
Drinking just makes things worse in every way, don't do it man. What country did you get transferred to?
no, i'm not. my body count though is lower than five and higher than three, so pretty much mediocre. regarding my first post in this thread, my initial and long term experience with women had been terrible. that made me dislike the superficial world of hookups and one night stands even when i'm eligible to live this lifestyle (at least on the physical side of requirements).
as for my libido, it decreased a bit in my late 20s but it still the same since then. usually i jerk of one to three times a day but can go few days without molesting myself.
Swapped one third-world to another third world, so not a lot changed in terms of QoL stuff. Language barrier is a bitch thou.
this website is +18, get the fuck out newfag
prepubescents motherfucker, go work out and read books before you turn into a miserable cunt like half the people in this board, faggot
When you're so filled with self-loathing, your mind can make excuses for even the most obvious of come-ons.
The man is 22
keep going
k
You're a really funny dude, too bad you like people enjoying your company. If she worked at the salon, safe to say she was fairly hot?
I got hard from reading this. Interacting with women is a total fantasy to me.
I should probably move to a different industry, one with chicks. There aren't many chicks in fluorochemics.
I'm a poor judge of hot but I always thought she was pretty. I remember thinking she had a nice face. This happened around 5 or 6 years ago so I'm hazy on the finer details, especially since you could easily see 100+ people every day at that job. I think she was a Chinese mix, a fellow part-azn, though she looked it more and likely didn't have the associated lifetime problems with fitting in somewhere. She had a casual sort of style that made her seem easy-going even in the uniform. The salon was more modern, if I had to deduce based on just this.
If life's gonna make you a clown, all you can do is accept the resulting circus. Honk honk. Looking over them, I think these anecdotes are the closest I ever had to a normal life and it was at a fucking wageslave job I specifically picked to powerlevel my weak social skills. Some mildly depressing schadenfreude to sprinkle over your daily kek.
i wish there was somewhere i could read all your stories in your writing, its hard to explain but i like it since it flows so good
This right here, you're good at it. We probably won't run into each other ever again besides this thread, more?
yea i personally would gladly make a basic website for it, maybe something like this one im currently working on
That would be really cool. Too bad in the current year, you probably wouldn't get much traffic and would have to resort to tumblr or something similar.
true true sometimes i hate the modern internet :(
It is what it is, you can't beat it.
ow
Happy to hear my broken brain nonsense can make a few wayward anons happy for a little while. You're likely right as I don't post here often; the board (and site in general) has changed a lot from when it was first made and it ceased to be comfy a long time ago.
I'd rather not throw my life stories up on a proper site, I'm just here to shitpost memories into the wind and let them die with the thread like everyone else. However, if you're particularly good at analyzing writing styles, you may come across some articles and papers floating around certain spaces that seem familiar, though the subject matter is rather different and not all of them are in English. Maybe you will see me again that way, if only a past-me.
I'm trying to think of ones worth transcribing. It's from over a period of around 10 years and most of the days were pretty samey. There was a consistent "thing" where I apparently always scared the new female workers that didn't work directly with me that I wasn't aware of. Apparently they all thought I was serious and scary or something because I don't emote much unless I remember to fake something. There was a Filipino lady on the team who adored me for some reason and treated me like a sibling, so she was like "nooo, not scary!" and suddenly hugged me from behind to prove the point and the new girl lightened up after that. On the outside it could be considered a "cute" moment, but it was actually awful and tense internally. See, I had a real bad time with physical bullying and homelife growing up and I also do shit like kickboxing now, so if I hadn't froze I would have reflexively elbowed through her face and accidentally proved her wrong. I can't even make this one flow as an entertaining greentext, the whole thing was pure stress.
Shes so pretty too, and we were so close. Havent had a gf since fat weeb. Still never had sex or someone I really loved.
I'm sorry, man. What happened to the fat weeb?
She trooned out. Didnt like her really anyway but she had friends and I needed friends.
I want to strange big pharma with my bare hands.
Yeah, that whole friend group trooned out as far as I know, all fat weebs really into yaoi. I just wanted to maintain a pure relationship with coffee shop girl, eventually she just stopped talking to me and now Im a lonely insecure incel creepily messaging her delusionally thinking she may still be interested. I deserve this though honestly, cant get her crying in that storage room at church in the dark while talking to me outta my head.
I hate myself worth a passion and honestly this world would probably be warmer if I left.
Storytime?
The upside is that you're still a teen. When you get into college, absolutely do introduce yourself to people, even if it's just your roommates or a school club. Reaching out is often the only way to meet people or everyone just assumes you want to be left alone and you get nowhere.
https://voca.ro/14jcXfSokLBe
I swear, this thread was made for you to shine lol. Have any of the girls ever been physical with you? I mean blatantly like sitting on your lap and grinding or shoving your arm between their boobs while walking? Anything that screams they are interested?
Imma ignore the point of this thread and tell about an actual good experience I had whit a buddy 
I turned her down for a fat weeb, cause I wanted our friendship to last forever, she was crying in the storage room at a church sleepover because I was with the fat weeb, but I left the fat weeb to talk to her, we must have sat 2 hours in that room with the lights off cause she didnt want me to see her cry.
I should really kill myself.
Now look here, you--
I pointedly avoid as many situations as possible where this can happen. This shit only occurred at all because I was at work and a flood of people were coming to me, and I was in work wear instead of dressed like the Unabomber in hobo chic. There were a few times where someone sat close or something, but it was near the end of high school which was just a few years after my shoulder got fucked up pretty bad by a psycho kid with a box cutter, so it didn't register as anything but some kind of potential attack. I always just tensed up or moved away and most got the message. Helps I accidentally broke someone's nose when they tried to shake me awake from a nap.
There was a weird fixation with my hair though, still is. (I wear it longer since I look bad with shorter hair, and I guess girls like that.) I'd been visiting a friend of the family working at a local business in the mall and was heading home. Some girl I'd seen in the halls a few times walked over from her friends and started just... petting my head? It was fucking weird and I'm still not sure if it wasn't some kind of joke between them. I asked her to stop and she eventually did and left. I think that's when I started wearing a hood full-time. I had it down once years later, and some ladies running a hair care booth accosted me to try to ask me about products or if I was interested, and one of them wouldn't stop running her fingers through it even when I asked her to stop and it was really uncomfortable. She was like 90s Morticia Addams crossed with Nosferatu and something about her manner made all sorts of red flags shoot up. Made you feel like she was going to harvest your organs for her company. Managed to force out an increasingly tense "no thank you" and extricate myself from their claws.
So yeah, I'm a hazard to everyone around me and everything outside my house is terrifying. I haven't even gotten to the stories where guys have tried.
oh im sorry if i made you mad i just thought it would fit well with the music
This is gonna sound dumb, but that whole "there is no growth without pain" thing is true. That experience sucked but it's important because it's helping teach you what to do in the future if something like this happens again, even if it's not to you. No one can see the future and you're not bad for what you did. You made a call, you took it, and it turned out to be one you didn't like. That's all. Trick is to try to do better every day, even if it's not by a lot.
I'm not mad, I'm bantering back. It was begging to be made fun of. It's gratifying you noticed I specifically made that part tongue-in-cheek, if anything. Maybe I'll do the next one in Limerick form.
yes, yes you should. imagine fumbling that hard
Thanks man, kinda had to say no as well, couldnt just break with the fat weeb for her, but I shouldve.
So hard. Shes so fucking pretty and nice and adorably awkward.
Loyalty is an extremely important trait. The only problem is that it isn't universal, so you have to learn who it give it to. That's part of the growth game, too. I've also fucked up there pretty hard, I think everyone has. You're part of the club now, bud.
Just scrolled through her instagram again, suicide fuel.
No. Do not do that. Bad. It does no good and you're hurting yourself for no reason. There is no gain to be had. Close the social media cancer.
Wish you could see her, youd know how hard I fumbled.
Blonde hair, blue eyes, skinny.
Shes the nicest person youd ever meet, socially awkward and self conscious but in a really cute way.
ok OP is here to confirm for the 1000x time, "fembot" fuckers dont actually exist
we get it. women have it easy
Appreciate the good and value that's there, but don't dwell, man. You're just lengthening one brief mistake into one that lasts years instead of moments, and you can't gain the xp if the fight never ends. I dunno when that'll be for you, but definitely don't torture yourself needlessly. Maybe you'll meet again in the future. If that happens, it'd probably be great if you were the best version of yourself that has as much shit together as he can manage. And if it doesn't happen, you're still better off than you'd be turning yourself into a suicidal alcoholic over pixels owned by Zuckerberg on bookface 2.0, now with feet pics.
Holy fuck, she didnt actually open it, there is no seen status, I dont know if I dreamed it. Pray for me anons.
Why am I like this
can confirm anon
Is this what femoids mean when they say "There must have been girls in your life who liked you, and you just didnt pick up on their signals cus your autistic"?
If so, that means I literally never have had a girl express any interest to me.
Call yourself Neo because you dodged a fucking bullet, is what you did. Never even fathom getting involved with BPD chicks unless you know she's in therapy to help her control it and can confirm it's working.
actually wtf
You're not op
Fuck off Jewish ai
Exactly, she had a bf next week so a relationship with her would have been questionable at best.
no shit, fukcing moid
That kinda reminds me of something I fumbled my freshman year
You never thought to invite her in?
You are a fembot right? How bad did I fumble, do you think there is a chance? Im coffee shop girl guy by the way.
Thought it would have been weird in the moment if she was supposed to be next door hanging out with her friends. Also >>73157630 is me so I was still acting like I didnt want to make any friends
so what's the problem then? you didn't exactly make a blunder since you did what you wanted, right? i mean, your goal at the time was no relationships and you achieved it. i would of understood better if you wanted something and made a mistake in the moment, but you didn't. at the next school did you start getting girls then?
when did i say i was a fembot
The problem is that I realized I was being retarded by trying to act like some kind of Ryan Gosling sigma male character instead of just going for it
And tragically, at my next school I had more opportunities to get girls that I diffused with my autism.
so you haven't had a gf/sex before?
You guessed it
the last girl i tried dating straight up tried to blackmail me via parents after our first date because she said "she felt like it", it's been half a year and i'm still worried about dating
You called someone a moid.
how many more opportunities did you blow at the new school? i could be wrong so forgive me, but from the sounds of it the girls put in repeated good efforts to show interest. it's not a simple one instance (like a girl at store being flirty with you never to see you again) but them taking the lead and being somewhat persistent. do you go to the club where girls would be even more forceful or not something you want to try?
i also call foid foid
t. moid
How does a girl you just met blackmail you? Did you tell her a secret your parents don't know?
Fair enough, thought you were a foid, figured a foid would have some insight on how bad I fucked up.
This is fake and gay. Any human capable of having a friend group is social enough to read the cues. If true, you're not a sperg your just a coward.
I was generally antisocial up until my senior year yet here are the hits
I have other instances where I was aware I was being hit on but those were mostly girls I was really not attracted to.
why not online date? are you still in school?
Repost, not originale
no one knows just from a few posts here
A few years out of school now. Thought about onlinr dating but I dont really have any good pictures of me to use and thats kind of necessary
you don't seem like the type to need good pictures if you catch my drift. if you had your friend or even your mom take a few pics it would be fine.
i meant to say if you have, not had.
I imagine it sounds like huge overreaction from my side, but the whole thing really did a number on me back then. Was the first and also last time i asked someone out too obviously. Imagining what some other bitch could pull today with shit like metoo being at her disposal, i think i'm perfectly content dying alone.
I hope this is true, for your sake.
I'm not going to give you a hard time over your reaction, anon. One thing I will say is that you shouldn't let one bitch stop you from ever finding a good girl.
Normalfags are cruel

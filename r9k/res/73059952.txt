<comment>
I end your fucking life
<comment>
With the will to do that
<comment>
It's been fixin' to happen
<comment>
And then it does
<comment>
I hear the sounds of bones crunching
<comment>
And flesh flaying
<comment>
Knives are gonna be chopping heads
<comment>
Making death out of people
<comment>
Turning them into corpses
<comment>
And other bodily contortions
<comment>
It really breaks them down
<comment>
Causing another deathly death
<comment>
Like a death that needed to happen
<comment>
But actually did need to happen
<comment>
To prevent further degradation of the world
<comment>
lazy ass fell asleep
<comment>
you should just watch MLP and spam it everywhere like I do until all of humanity is converted to bronies! That's what I do, and that's productive!
BLEED YOURSELF OUT
<comment>
Such degradation is unnecessary
<comment>
And will be the end of you
<comment>
The actions you want to endorse will fail
<comment>
Causing a brutal death for you
<comment>
It breaks bones
<comment>
cheese 'chived on /hc/
<comment>
And cuts through the veins
<comment>
YOU WILL BE LEFT TO BLEED DRY
<comment>
To make dismembered humans
<comment>
That would all be dead
<comment>
Life would not be restored for them
<comment>

<comment>
Not when death is in play
<comment>
So that death comes
<comment>
shitty taste in feet smt
<comment>
To eviscerate the unworthy humans
<comment>
awww mt is spamming fast so he can go back to sleep lmao lazy fuck
<comment>
YOUR EYEBALLS WILL BE PULLED OUT OF THEIR FUCKING SOCKETS
<comment>
perhaps you should have a life like mine, spamming MLP everywhere and attacking anyone who doesn't like it! That's a much more productive use of time!
YOU WILL BE TURNED TO DUST
<comment>
Who were never deserving of life
<comment>

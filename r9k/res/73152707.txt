i woke up from my 5 hour sleep and saw this >>73148458 â†’ and i broke down crying because i know that no one will ever love me enough to do something like that for me. my dog heard me crying and came over to comfort me and we fell asleep together. i woke up and i still feel hollow and my body is numb and sore. i am so lonely. i want to love someone. i want to be loved. i don't think i can do this anymore.

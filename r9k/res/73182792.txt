How do you find online communities online?
I've got a discord account and steam account but just can't seem to connect with anyone I think more so just from lack of opportunity. I really want to find a community I can just talk in while I'm bored but anything public is awful and are filled with normalshits

You got a fuckton of social media that you can connect to, fb groups oftenly have good comunities, you can filter it out from there
Or you can always double down and go to the genre subreddit

I want freedom
Not a boss that comes in a forty ounce bottle of
Anything or taped scotch paper
I eat meat and drive trucks
And shoot guns and don't trust in the
Federal government to solve our problems
You might think I'm joking
But I'm not a Republican
Call me when your president pulls out of Afghanistan
Because that's the day I'll get a cell phone number
And you can call and leave a message on voice mail that day

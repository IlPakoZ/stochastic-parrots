being tall lanklet sucks
I wish I was short and chubbier
I'm contemplating how I want a gf who has similar interests and who loves me

god
my loneliness and pain
going to check up on my water that im boiling for my ginger tea i put out about 10 minutes ago
maybe playing world of warcraft, and what mounts i should farm
what it would feel like to experience love
if mutual love exists
what is the justification for believing in moral intuitionism, i listened to this a decent bit yesterday
looksmaxing and the hopeless pursuit of trying to ascend as a loser

Where I'm going to go next in life.
Either move to Florida to be with her or keep trying my hand at surviving alone.
what foreskin feels like
I wonder if there is a modpack for terraria dedicated to optimization and I wonder if there are game engines dedicated to low spec that have 3d capabilities (side from Godot &amp; certain builds of unity)
Suicide and how to survive as a homeless person. I'm tired of working for zog and funding endless forever wars
If I should cut down that old oak next to driveway or keep it around another year. One hand it looks good, but other hand leaves are annoying, tree is bit old and squirrels keep shitting on my car.

my dad died this week, he was old and full of problems that could have ended him at anytime, so this was expected
i had not seen him since February cause he was in hospital, spoke to him over the phone a few weeks ago, had no idea that would be the last time
see ya space cowboy
rip ur dad anon, I'm so sorry to hear that

Oh my God this board is so shit now
I remember in high school I'd come Here every day reading greentext meme stories and having a blast
It's all juat cuck threads and "muh femcel" 
This is absolutely abhorrent. You ruined my favorite board

What's the point of making good green text anymore? other people just take them and monetize them on youtube or repost them on reddit while you get nothing.

idrc what fags on other sites do, just don't pay them any attention
greens are still an integral part of our culture, and we shouldn't stop making them cause a few pissheads reposted them for muh internet points

2012-2015 was when I regularly browsed here. During the 2015 r9k school shooting event people like you flooded to this board and made it cuck /soc/

Agreed - r9k was always incel adjacent but 90% of people were honest about their own failures and shortcomings - now it's all "no the world is wrong, I am very intelligent and other people are the problem" classic MRA red pill shit

5 years ago, when I came here, it was sad because of all the suffering from social outcasts and misfits. Now it's sad to see how dumb and disordered young people have become. The whole society is failing now, even the normies don't know how to live a sane life. I think in another 5 years this board will be gone.

we're all doomed, aren't we?
I've always been modest, not really punching down like that when I was younger knowing deep down it was likely my own future I'd be mocking. I was completely correct. Karma isn't real, but I find it a bit easier to live with myself not having done that like so many young shits choose to. I guess if you're already well along on the path to normalcy then it's unlikely to matter. CSM is mid.
I'm 31 and have my shit together, sorry for your loss.

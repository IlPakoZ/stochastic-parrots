I never had a chance. But with large leaps we're seeing in AI and robotics, will robot waifus finally become a thing?
No. Been reading about it around 2016 and we're nowhere close. got my hopes so fucking up when they said it will feel better than live vagina
the language models are good enough desu. all the public models are pretty lobotomized &amp; not that well tuned for realistic speech but im sure it could be done
given gpt4 can "see" i dont really think we're that far off from connecting an artificial intelligence to at least some sort of body either
Im glad I have hunter eyes
If we're really headed into the singularity, a robot girlfriend will seem like a quaint wish. Imagine taking a pill and fixing all your genetic deficiencies, and/or growing a biological flesh and blood replicant girlfriend, and/or plugging your brain in directly into a matrix world where you can have infinite girlfriends. It sounds crazy but it could all be possible
you look like a fucking paki
You sure think a lot about guy's eyes. Are you gay?
There are hunter and prey eyes...
And the is you. The infamous no-eyes fag, fucking blind
Guys on the left
Kills and rape
Girls cum
Guys on right
Wageslave 8 hours a day
Harmless and invisible
Girls call them creeps
What did nature mean by this?
ask your mom shed know
You misspelled fetal alcohol syndrome
David Dastmalchian, is that you?
Ai in its current form, is like a child copying from adults. 
If it bevomes more advanced it will replicate real foid behaviour and reject you 100%

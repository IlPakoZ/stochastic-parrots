In great shape and capable
go to see the woman you like, bring her bunches of flowers and try to do a romantic swoop in

He clearly wasn't chad enough. He should've thought about that before being a ginger male. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFUIZfyIbxk [Embed]

He was an overcompensating faggot that could've easily impressed most other women with his powers. The main hero was based for faking his death to play guitar.

There is a line where titan says
This is the first time you have ever tried to be social with me and hang out and its because Im about to destroy metro city, you never cared about me not once
And yet the movie also acts like he is an irredeemable villain, but he is right. He asked for coffee or lunch between work multiple times and she didnt even want to see him once, even as a friend, or a workmate.

i watched this movie because of your megamind posting and it was pretty good. they really do make a socially awkward incel the villain (mass murderer). 
chad sociopath turning out to be an alright guy kind of sucked, as well as megamind suddenly being loved by everyone when in the first place everyone hated him for being a blue domed fuck up. and he even gets the mary sue to love him, when i thought the whole point was that hal was bad for wanting her too much. the first half was way better. still alright.

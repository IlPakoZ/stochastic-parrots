I think I made a mistake adopting a 400lbs neet from r9k. I hate my life now more than ever.
What do you mean "adopting"
She was a neet living with her parents so I drove to her state and brought her back to move in with me
literally brought that upon yourself OP, that kinda fucked up hugeness doesn't happen out of nowhere
walking warning sign, less the walking
Have you considered dropping her off somewhere and ghosting her
put her on a diet then
or move her back to her parents
actually if it were that easy you'd just do it, what's stopping you?
OP is of course a larp, but realistically speaking, how much would it cost to maintain a diet for such a person?
Imagine crossing state lines, to load a 400 pound woman unto your Uhaul rental truck and taking her home. Wtf is wrong with you?
That would be literally evil in reality. She doesn't drive. Her parents wouldn't come get her. She would die on the side of the road or probably be homeless then raped and murdered. I couldn't live with that.
Ok then give her to another retard with money who wants to play house
She's not on speaking terms with her family, that bridge is burnt. I try to suggest we duet but she will overeat on any food brought into the house so it's pointless. I've also gained weight since being with her. She has this weird dampening energy that drags me down to her level and makes me give up on myself and be a fat fuck too. Before we moved in we told each other we were going to improve together.
Oh no... that sounds horrible. But if you aren't legally forbidden from doing that...
why not tho?
guarantee some other sap would see her and pick her up and drop her at a shelter or w/e, fatsax are very talented at locating &amp; absorbing resources
I thought she would be happy and healthier with me. I felt bad for her and we connected but I just ended up getting fat by being with her.

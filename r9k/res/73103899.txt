Presumably, you were something of a tomboy or at least gender neutral growing up. Most men are aware of how tomboys relate to boys, but how did you relate to the more traditionally feminine girls (i.e. the ones who are only into hair and makeup and boys)? Did you interact with them much? Did you get along? Did they bully you? If so, what kinds of bullying tactics did they use?

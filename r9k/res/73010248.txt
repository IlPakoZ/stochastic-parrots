I wasn't around early enough to experience the age of the 90's that is regarded as the best time to be alive, missed by a couple of years. I remember though stuff like the wii and Xbox 360, as well as some other stuff like windows XP on a family desktop and watching movies from VHS tapes. I don't think about the past often, but being in solitude for the past couple months now, it seems that despite the major technological innovations that have taken place in the past decade or so since then, everything has gotten worse. Maybe it's just a bad outlook on things, I don't know.

Why does everyone here say it's impossible to leave this board?
we are all crabs in a bucket
Not many are willing to leave their comfort zone for the self improvement zone.
An incel can fuck someone, a political extremist can change his views, a robot can change his life, but deep down, he will aways be a robot.
It's not. I left this board.
It's not about this board necessarily, every board says that. It's 4chan overall. It's social media with none of the hassle or censorship, for better or for worse. And it's instant gratification. I really need to grab a book for my long shits.
Because cuckolding is very addictive.

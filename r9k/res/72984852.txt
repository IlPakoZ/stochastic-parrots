I want a dog because i watch dog video and look at dog images all day but i cant hug and pet the videos so i want to buy my own dog but i dont want to watch it die but even if i protect it it will die before me because they like like 15 years at best and im a 22 year old human and we like... 80 years or something so im going to outlive it for sure.
just put it up for adoption when its old
I will become to emotionally attached to it to do that.
I even become emotionally attached to inanimate objects if i spend too much time with them i imagine my attachment would be even worse with a living being.

Think of it this way, when your oggy dies it will be at peace because you gave it the best life it could have.

yeah anon no way to help you with this. you just have to realize that everything you live will one day die. in the meantime, you loved that dog as much as you could and gave it a great life than it would have otherwise had. That's enough to cope with the fact that they'll die for me at least

okay you're a faggot. grow some fucking balls and stop being a pussy. love a dog or don't. god you're such a fucking loser

I don't trust you with a dog. You should have to pass an egg test, first. Your capacity for love alone isn't enough to provide the orgasmic quality of life an animal needs.

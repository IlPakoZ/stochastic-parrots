DM random girls on instagram
She gets really interested
"Let me see your face"
*Blocked*
What the fuck do I do? It's not like I can't talk to women or don't have game, but the moment women see me they're instantly uninterested. I literally got some random girl my friend half-knew to send me nudes and the moment she saw my face she blocked me on all socials, as if I had done something bad. What am supposed to?

Post your face obviously.
<comment>
No, but just imagine I'm ugly
<comment>
obviously but we need to know how ugly
some guys are ugly cute but others are just plain ugly
<comment>
I'm 260lbs.
<comment>
so it has nothing to do with being ugly, you're just fat 
lose weight

Post face so we can give you suggestions on how to fix it , changes are how youre taking the picture is fucking you over.

how do you even start dms like that

i didnt have a some concrete method or anything, this is just the natural flow of conversation I would follow
- say hello
- say they look pretty
- act like I want to take them somewhere (im lying)
- switch to the topic of looks
- reiterate that theyre pretty
- ask for a fit pic
- ask to see them naked (this is the hardest part, depends on how the rest of the convo went)

assuming i look good is this an efficient m.o. to get to a hookup
also what's a fit pic

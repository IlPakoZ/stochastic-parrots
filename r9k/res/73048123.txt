I think gen z where the last generation to be able to enjoy their childhoods. With social media being rampant and faggot millenial parents forcing their children to share their views. I dont see gen z parents being any better.
Genz are children from gen x
Millenials were the last generation to have happy childhood without internet
Social media and phone super glue have already doomed gen z as parents. I doubt gen a will have a bright future or create a beautiful world as we pass on due to predecessors negligence. Golden childhood moments will be tiktok reels or some shitty social media flashback or maybe a LGBTQ win in government or on the news celebrated like a fucking Martin Luther King movement
This. Having seen and spoken to a bunch of young zoomers now, they don't have childhoods. The only memories they will have is staring at subscriber counts on youtube and tiktok.
gen z parents are gonna be amazing and the generation after alpha is gonna be one of the strongest we've seen mark my words.
Why do you think so? From what I've seen so far it's going to be the opposite. Parents have started giving children phones to distract them from such an early age it makes me sick. I've seen literal babies in cribs holding phones. I think the following generation will have some serious problems with addiction, focus, and learning.
that and just the fact that zoomers are miserable, all of them obsessed with identity politics, and firmly in the belief that everything sucks and just become huge negative zones. And then there's the horde of zoomzoom troons, don't get me started.

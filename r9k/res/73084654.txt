I'll probably kill 50 people, take pictures of the bodies, and then go back home like nothing happened and live in my bunker while no one knows what is happening.
Either killing animals or sex with animals.
It's half the life-span in prison forever.
I think I will kill a male animal soon.
I get mad when I see that I am living in prison forever.
I can't even drive to the NSA office and kill everyone inside because they'll just boost the funding to the NSA even if I kill 15 people before they kill me, and the bullshit will intensify after I die.
And then once the nukes hit the people responsible will be long gone, so I can't go over there after it's over and start shooting people either because it will be over.
Everyone in that office deserves a slow and painful death from a bullet hole to the stomach and to watch their guts seep out of their bodies.
I want to take a gun and personally shoot everyone to death inside that building.
I would do it, but I will never get to.

Whenever women do this I assume it's fear and they're trying to placate me because they're scared I'm going to unless my sperg rage on them.
you are probably right
TFW women rarely stare at me and when they do, they never smile or talk. They give me nothing to go with.
I get likes and matches online, but they never speak, let alone want to fuck. The curse of the averagecel.
but this wasn't a polite awkard smile, she kept eyeballing me and smiling with her eyes. Like her eyes were crinkling and her head was craning (she is smol) as she passed me.
i have a even harder time discerning women's looks, I'm asian in a predominately white area. Girls sometimes eyeball me, I never know if its curiosity or a invitation to talk to them.
Why are ugly asian girls so much cuter than ugly white girls?
if they hold eye contact and move their head to keep it while you walk past them, then yea, they find you attractive
mhrw women stare at me
No one can guarantee you anything but that's more than enough reason to approach.
Doesn't happen

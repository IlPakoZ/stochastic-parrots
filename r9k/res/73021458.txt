If God real why "bad" thing happen
Because whatever God decides is good is good and whatever he decides is bad is bad. He is the originator of morality.
If a child got cancer and died young it's GOOD. If a woman gets impregnated by rape and raises the baby it's GOOD. If both of your parents died before the age of 11 it's GOOD.
Humanity doesn't see the wisdom behind these things and will never know the full wisdom and knowledge of The LORD. Also his existence doesn't hinge on our views of morality.

This is his practice universe. This universe was the 400lb girl he fucked a few times to get some practice before hitting on the Becky universe.

Cum brain comment.
If God is omniscient then he must possess knowledge of every possible scenario. This universe is one of the scenarios he considered before attempting a Good universe. It sucks we didn't make the cut. We're not part of the Stacy universe.

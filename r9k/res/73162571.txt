I was walking outside yesterday with my headphones in minding my own business and 3 zooomer girls came up and said hi to me. My zoomer gf who was with me got pissed off which was cute. By the way, Im 37. If girls are that friendly these days than certainly you guys can get a gf. If theyre so friendly that they even try to talk to middle aged strangers theres no reason you cant get a gf.
i dare you to say hi to that creepy pedo over there
I am reasonably sure that the last female stranger who spoke to me outside of it being either her job or mine to do so was some random uni slut in a club pre-pandemic asking me to sell her coke (I did not have any coke). I have only gotten fatter and more reclusive since that moment.
I ignored them because i dont trust zoomers not to set you up for some tiktok bs but i heard them say wow that was rude of him i dont think ive ever been blown off like that before when i ignored them. Though i dont think it was a weird dare because girls always are nice to me because im a nice person i guess. The ones that yell i wanna suck ur dick at me when theyre driving by are probably a dare tho

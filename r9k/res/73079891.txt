Will listen to it. I see some songs desabled, idk if they are region locked.
I have not. I dont own a PS5 and no money. But I do enjoy listening to videogame soundtracks a lot and this is a good one.

I do enjoy songs like that, I have a 40s to 60s hits playlist.Yyou song is like modern take on 60s. Something about the static of an old microphone makes it sound special.
You should create a playlist by now.

I've been listening to Sewerslvt a lot. I like "Ecifircas" and "self destruction worldwide broadcast". I don't recommend if you don't have some sort of mental illness/retardation, even then it took a while for it to click but now I find them to be absolute bangers

Classicccccc, amazing song. I already have it in my playlists haha.
It is an acquired taste for sure but I apreciate the skill required to make a song sound asymmetrical and good at the same time.

It's quite cliche but it's genuinely a very nice song, especially this version: https://youtu.be/y8AWFf7EAc4 [Embed]

(sewers is actually terrible at what he does, you just don't know the genre well enough)

Roman sidorov has lots of good songs. Though I guess it's more like ambience for a very specific mood.

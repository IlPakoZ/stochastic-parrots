Should I sell a fanatec rennsport v2 cockpit with slight shipping damage for 2k to a "12 year old" that is trying to make his first sim rig or should I say no and wait for any other buyers? Currently selling it for 3.5k and I really want to say no at the moment.
My bad, I dont use the eurodollar so I meant to say 200 dollars and 350 dollars respectively

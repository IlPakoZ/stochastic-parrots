hmm it isnt that bad , maybe she doesnt want to look easy .
see if second date you can get to the kiss. 
if she comes with another 'distraction' , you know its time to move on..
Yeah don't give up, might still get side action
Only misstake you did. Should have said that if she's no interested in hanging out then you won't waste your time. Or just left.
You fucking normalfaggot. Wife material, she is not tryna be easy.
Just go on another date
kind of sucks, I wouldn't know but I imagine a lot of relationships are like that in high school / college

we were watching akira on my laptop and started cuddling. 
we stopped midway through and ate and were kinda just talking. 
in a conversational lull she gets up to start doing her math homework 
i thought it was kinda weird that she started doing her homework while we were on a date

i kamakazee my inhabitions and go in for a kiss 
she laughs and says "dont distract me from my homewok haha" 
damn its over 
i ask if she wants me to leave and she says no i can stay as long as i dont distract her 
I just offer to leave so I won't distract her.
hmm it isnt that bad , maybe she doesnt want to look easy .
see if second date you can get to the kiss. 
if she comes with another 'distraction' , you know its time to move on..
Yeah don't give up, might still get side action
so I won't distract her
Only misstake you did. Should have said that if she's no interested in hanging out then you won't waste your time. Or just left.
You fucking normalfaggot. Wife material, she is not tryna be easy.
Just go on another date
kind of sucks, I wouldn't know but I imagine a lot of relationships are like that in high school / college

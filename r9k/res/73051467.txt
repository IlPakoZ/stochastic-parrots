How often do you think about suicide?
Would you ever actually do it?
How often do you think about suicide?
Depends, sometimes every once in awhile, sometimes everyday.
I would like to think so eventually but I seem to never know when to give up. I will probably keep going until I end up too old and feeble to manage it. If I don't die by some other means first.
I've been thinking about death a lot lately and I've come to the conclusion that it's not so bad. I've been through death before, when I wasn't born yet. What did I feel before I was born? Nothing, then that's what I'll feel when I die. There's no fear of the unknown anymore because I've already been through it. And besides, there's nothing anyone can do about death, I would rather die with dignity and comfortably on my own terms than go kicking and screaming.
Only when I am in a negative mood that's lasted days on end. I wouldn't because it would harm people in my life.
Anyone else like this?
I've been like that since I was 10 and I never escaped it until now. You need to sit down and have a long hard think about death, stop avoiding it. Remove all distractions, light up a ciggy, and just think.
I am doing it slowly by over-eating
I'm currently at a BMI of about 40.

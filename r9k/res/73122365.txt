practice in choir for a bit for next Sunday
go to my usual spot after practice, a cafe where i work sometimes at the behest of a family member
find friend working, talk with him while playing terraria with only 27 mods cause my laptop is dogshit
!augh, generally, have a great time, but become quiet or silent when he brings up drama or gossip about friends that I could care less about unless I really hear it from them
start getting real quiet, bout to pack my stuff and leave after crafting Der Freischutz, saving prog and paying for the drinks we shared
wave him goodbye but hear him say something along the lines of "you've become quite the wallflower" and something about my previous women I've had a crush on
ask him why he brought that shit up, he goes silent and I just leave before a second passes
Why'd he suddenly being that stuff up? I am in no way attractive or anything so him surprising me with that curveball really threw me off. what did he mean by "wall flower" Anyways? My short term memory loss fails me once again

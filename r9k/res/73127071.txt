I want to reclaim my youth in my late 20s and early 30. Like, having an 18 year old gf, getting wasted with friends, seeing a bunch of concerts, doing drugs. I need to make it happen somehow.

How did Scott Pilgrim get an Asian Highschool GF?

Scott Pilgrim was 22, not 32 - date girls your own age and watch a concert. Simple

none of these things make you satisfied in the end, it's just cope for young and stupid, get a hobby

Have fun being ignored by everyone around you and seen as the creepy boomer pedo

Well you better start today with haste then, that will only get harder to have the older you get. Also that lifestyle is overrated, anons just idealize it because girls peak in hotness in their early 20s, and they happen to be doing stuff like this at that time

The painful reality. It's over.

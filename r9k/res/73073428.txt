I used Chat GPT to cheat on my exam.

kek why not use your notes if you had computer access? using chatgpt would give answers clearly not taken from the class. also every time i use chatgpt for technical topics it's wrong like 30% of the time, enjoy your C-!

I tried getting chatgpt to perform a simple fucking task for me so I could save like 2 minutes on an assignment and ended up spending 5 minutes fighting with chatgpt and failing it to get it to do what I wanted. Never again

chatgpt get's math problems wrong and it's really pissing me off

chatgpt does a pitch perfect simulation of a kind of stupid person googling something for you then making a book report

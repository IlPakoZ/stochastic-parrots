woman cant even contain her laughter at the sight of me
She literally looked like picrel as I walked by
she wasnt looking at you
She made eye contact with me the entire time. Apparently I can't even take a walk without being laughed at for existing.

Women still have it worse and are faced with the threat of rape for just existing rather than ridicule.
<comment>
shut the fuck up faggot I would rather be raped than laughed at
<comment>
I was shitposting for hours earlier and couldn't help myself from bursting out into laughter when I walked outside. When someone saw me I sure as fuck looked that guy right in the eyes and smiled.

making eye contact with strangers
I seriously hope you guys don't do this
<comment>
Yeah I'm sure this random college-aged Stacy was shitposting all day before seeing me
She looked at me first and when I looked at her because she was laughing she didn't look away
<comment>
one of you niggers better tell me this has happened to you or im going to kms myself
<comment>
Yes women have laughed at me before. Are you short? Why did she laugh
<comment>
Are you short
I'm 5'10"
Why did she laugh
I'm guessing I look so goofy or pathetic that it's funny
<comment>
yeah, used to get laughed at all the time by women for being short. Holes younger than me regularly called me kid/sweetie.
<comment>
Maybe she was giggling in an endearing way, like she found you cute. Women usually don't realize or meaningfully care how much their actions can affect guys who are clearly romance starved
<comment>
I really doubt it.
pretty hot and only like an inch shorter than me
looks up and sees me, looks down trying force down a laugh
can barely even contain it
locks eyes with me as I walk past her, continuing to be visibly unable to control her laughter
I mean maybe I'm just overthinking it but like you said I'm starved for relationships so
<comment>
She may have just laughed at how much control she had over your emotional state and/or how pathetic you seemed. Sorry anon, I know women can be brutal, even if they don't intend to be, frankly many of them don't care how they affect guys around them, except for their own entertainment and/or pleasure. You have to be mentally strong to not internalize how terrible some people can be. I'd also work on yourself to prevent that from happening in the future, body language can go far in how women treat you since they are so subconsciously motivated and controlled
<comment>
Yeah maybe but I don't see how she'd realize that only like half a second after seeing me. To me it seems likelier that I just look wimpy, but I guess that's essentially saying the same thing isn't it
<comment>
They are similar and it may have been a combination of both. You probably had an awestruck expression and she was laughing due to a combination of pleasure at her own power over you and at you for being so pathetic

projecting his inferiority complex/femdom fantasy
NGMI

Kek, maybe, but I still think what I said is true. A lot of women can relate to femdom sentiment even if they don't feel it as strongly

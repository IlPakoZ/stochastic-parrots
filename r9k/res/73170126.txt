I couldn't get into college so I picked up a trade. I work my blue collar job and go home, I'm invisible to women and bust my ass for enough pay to afford rent.
One day I will buy some cheap land and only work part-time to afford little things. I will die alone, but in peace.

How short and fat are you?
Being short is much worse than being fat when it comes to getting women in my experience. (I'm 5'6")

i go to the grocery store and everyone there is tall and good looking. Most of the women are my height and i'm like 6' 1". The men are all 6' 4". Lliteral fucking UBERMENSCH. They have tons more sex than us. Are more likable than us. Have orders of magnitudes more friends and life experience than us. Are more attractive than us. When are we gonna drop this larp that they are somehow 'inferior' or 'bluepilled' or 'NPC'? They are more wise than any of us and are essentially deities. Summer is like ambrosia to them. They finally get to show off their hot bodies and well tuned social skills. For you it's just embarrassing when you go out because you are reminded that you are a worm compared to them. It's ok. I'm here to tell you that we should simply worship them instead of pretending to hate them. Maybe we should try to be more like them. In attempting this, we can become better. Just like how christians can never be sinless like christ, but they can do their darndest to try.

All those guys are alone. Look how segregated the white sexes are.
<comment>
well if you look at the video no one is really segregated. Short men are with tall women, people are race mixing, some are in mixed gender groups while some are in same gender groups

Literal normie propaganda

Average height is short, like 5'10 for men and 5'8 for women. Do you live in Iceland or something?

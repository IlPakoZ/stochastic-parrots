I wanna read stories about people who lost their virginities, preferably if it was something sweet and lovely.
I felt nothing
Realized I could never trust her and it became more apparent that it wasn't going to work long term. I faked my personality and it fooled her, took her anal virginity too. She loved it up the ass.
Kys poser
It was a ons with a high tier becky (stacylite if she lost ~10kg). We were both virgins and I came too fast so it was shit. She also gave me the world's worst blowjob, at least she tried I guess.
I had sex for the first time with almost 30. I was desperate it would never happened, yet it did, with a fairly pretty and very smart girl, who was younger and a KHHV before me.
The act itself was technically awful, what you'd expect from level 1 sexhavers with 0 EXP. What was magical, possibly life-changing, was the aftermath.
I got dressed again; shirt, pants, socks and all, while she prefered to remain completely naked for hours (this became a wonderful habit of hers). She crawled onto my lap, legs spread, facing me. She told me many nice things, how it wasnt my fault our first time wasn't as great, that she expected as much and there would likely be other, better times (there were).
I looked up and down her exposed body: thin, graceful, vulnerable. Even her feet were beautiful. And everything that was supposed to be beautiful about a female body, was even more so. Her eyes are grey and seemed absent, glassy. Her hair is dark, shiny and contrasted with her pale skin, flowing much broader than her delicate neck buried underneath it.
I realized how I gave her not even a fraction of the enjoyment she deserved. I had few clear thoughts, other than the one I voiced without thinking: "I really want to rail you *properly*."
Very different from the intellectual, tender way I always communicated with her, as we're both shy people. But she reacted so warm, so considerate towards my vulgarity. She laughed, flustered, thought of what to answer. "You finally admitted it", she said: she had been waiting for me to acknowledge my lust. Maybe, feeling lusted after is what women desire, even ones as shy as her.
Her legs locked aound my back, she laid her head over my shoulder and I held her. I kissed her sometimes. Silence. Neither of us was a virgin anymore, we entered a river you cannot enter twice. It wasn't about the rubbing of genitals, but rather about this acceptance.
No sure what the problem is with my memories, I remember small details of things girls have done to me.
If I can find a girl who can do all three of these I will marry her
How did you guys lose your vcard?
Against my will 
Sorry
Sorry you were raped, hope you find peace
That's beautiful anon, I'm happy for you
i was 5
i feel like i have lost a lot of value because i have "never" been a virgin

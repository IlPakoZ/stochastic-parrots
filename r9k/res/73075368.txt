TFW the 90s were so based, compared to today's living hell and creeping wage-slave dystopia, that even the school shooters were not incel.

Eric didn't go to prom and all the girls he went on dates with stopped seeing him. Dylan went only saw one girl (Eric's ex) for a very short period of time. Neither of them had real girlfriends. The girl Dylan went to prom with was a friend and they were both clear on that fact.

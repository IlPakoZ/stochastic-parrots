ive been drinking tons i was really thirsty

yessss
useless
its near the back of my head, dull and it sort of comes in waves, it gets better for a moment and then its really bad again
<comment>
it could be due to your horomones, are you at the start of a menstrual cycle, low estrogen might be the cause
<comment>
you could drink some coffee, it sounds like it might be due to blood pressure around the head, so the coffee will dilate the blood vessels, alternatively you can take some curcumin(Tumeric) with some omega3s like edamame or walnuts or certain fish

This.
Good night sleep is severely underrated.
And "night" part is important- you need darkness for restorative properties to kick in- so night or very heavy blinders are required.

I didn't know that! I was just recommending getting as much sleep time as possible regardless of the time, but it does make sense that the body would probably heal better in darkness. Anyways, get plenty of rest catposter!

Eating me will not cure your headache, catposter. I do not contain any medocinal ingredients.

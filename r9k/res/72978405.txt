Unless your computer has less than 4 gigs of ram, you can update to Windows 11
I sit on a plastic chair ffs. Poor family, no work, no neetbux.
Even if you have &lt;4gb of ram, you dont have to buy a new computer, just another ram module. Just how poor are you anon?
A lot of windows games work in steam for linux now because of Proton
I tried to install windows 7 on my new laptop but Microsoft removed support for that processor and I couldn't figure out the workaround. Now I live a lie with the win7 UI on Win10.
First VR, and now AI is forcing me to use the most up to date GPU drivers, so I've been on W10 for a while. Would otherwise probably be on 7.

I tried to install windows 7 on my new laptop but Microsoft removed support for that processor and I couldn't figure out the workaround. Now I live a lie with the win7 UI on Win10.

First VR, and now AI is forcing me to use the most up to date GPU drivers, so I've been on W10 for a while. Would otherwise probably be on 7.

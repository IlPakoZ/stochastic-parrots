Anyways my day was good. I'm just mad my dick got limp and libido dropped to nearly zero after I came inside my recently bought onahole for a few days. It felt great but I don't think it was worth it for my sex drive to go way down

debating between self harming or not, actually saw your bf doing good work on lgbt for once but I am still upset he has a gf and I have no one.

I suggest you not self harm. It's not good for you, you know? Also why get mad at my bf when there are billions of people who have a partner in the world
<comment>
its unironically and apologetically, unfathomably over
<comment>
I dont see how it is bad for me. I am not mad it is just unfair he gets what he wants and I get nothing. especially after he harassed me for so long.

I'm Bradley from New Orleans. OP is a 15 year old French girl named Clarissa who doxxes people all the time.

I'm almost always doing good work. You just now recognize the person I'm arguing with as an attention whore tripfag slut who LARPs as a femcel, so you instantly know it's justified.
No she's not. Why do you think that?

Grow my hair out for 2.5 years
Looking great, get plenty of compliments
Aunt and uncle come from third world country and stays with us
Cunt tells us she has lice after 1 month
gives it to me
Why does bad things happen to good people? If this dumb bitch told us from the get go, I could have gotten her the treatment, instead she waited until after touching my hair and sharing the same space as me to tell me. I'm gonna be real pissed if I have to end up cutting it my hair. I heard they are a bitch to deal with.

oh they definitely do have more treatments these days i had lice as a kid two or three times cause kids dont know what personal space is and i remember my mom having to do a lice treatment on my scalp and had to go through each section in little bits and use this substance to kill both the mature bugs and the eggs and the treatment substance smelt like black licorice which i hated but it worked and the only longer term thing i noticed and disliked was that the lice i think could also live on stuffed animals and clothes and things like that so we had to put all my stuffies in the attic but im sure a very hot dryer could kill the bugs too when it comes to those inanimate objects just do some research OP itll all be okay and you dont have to get rid of all your progress

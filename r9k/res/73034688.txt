Why do Americans think legal consequences are the only consequences in the world?
internalized State/government and lack of real spirituality
Sociopathy. Also, probably something they are very familiar with. Since they use court like as if it was some instrument of torture and death.
The one with most money can sue the other that has less money and win nearly every time and force the loser to pay for court expenses. lol what stupid country
I guess there just aren't enough tough guys like you around.
Because there are a lot of people with low empathy who will only do prosocial things if it directly benefits them through benefits or avoiding consequences.

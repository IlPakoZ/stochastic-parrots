Your first girlfriend, even if you get one, will have had all her first times with other men.
<comment>
other men
Men's rights really were a mistake. Why are men so fucking shit?
<comment>
Yep, and novelty is essential to elevating intimacy and memory etc. Nothing you do with her can be as special as that one time Chad bent her over beside a dumpster behind Burger King.
<comment>
For normal men it doesn't matter because they had all their first times with other women as well.
It's really only a problem for virgins.
<comment>
Pretty sure her first time dying a horrible death (in Minecraft) will be with me
<comment>
Nah, you'll never hear more misogyny than out of a sexually successful guys mouth when he's just around the bros.
He gives her a pass because he knows its impossible to find any woman different from that but it still matters a lot to him unless he is highly feminine with a female brain.
<comment>
You're talking about low-t cucks, not normal men. This guy here is more accurate >>73076058
<comment>
you'll never hear more misogyny
Sure but i dont think he'll specifically be complaining about her lack of purity in this day and age. They'd rather a kniky slut than a boring frigid virgin.
im just guessing btw i dont actually talk to other men.
<comment>
absolutely brutal
her true love will be with someone else, and she will just be trying to find something as good, all in vain
and its a downward spiral from the top, because women lose smv with age
Nah, you'll never hear more misogyny than out of a sexually successful guys mouth when he's just around the bros.
THIS
chad literally hates women and runs his fucking mouth on them. its only the black pilled loser incels and turbo-chads who LITERALLY say the same thing
and its the normies, redditors, cucks, and bluepillers who deny that shit
<comment>
I had all my first times with other women. It's a basic part of teenage life. In your 20s you're not talking about "firsts" anymore, you have more mature relationships.
<comment>
No i really you guys have warped perceptions from hanging out on imageboards.
<comment>
Jokes on you sex is awful
<comment>
This. Chad would never fuck a non-virgin. That's why women have such a hard time finding anyone above a 3/10.
<comment>
I got that perception from having normal male friends
<comment>
Sure but i dont think he'll specifically be complaining about her lack of purity in this day and age
guys who ran through girls see with their own eyes girls who cheat, lie to their bf or husband, acts like whores with him but like shy virgins with everyone else
its impossible being exposed to that shit to not be cynical about it. they see females how they truly are
<comment>
In your 20s you're not talking about "firsts" anymore, you have more mature relationships.
aka cuck shit
if she's ran through, then she's literally incapable of loving you and pairbonding. chad owns her heart and soul, and you are just some cuck to her
<comment>
That's the point though. They only go for cheaters and sluts. That's what they prefer. They don't even try to talk to regular girls, let alone virgins.
<comment>
incapable
Your fake chart proves the opposite. Lots of them are clearly capable. What are you coping with? Are you still somehow single in 2023? Or are you pairbonded? They say a guy who has watched porn is incapable of feeling love, is it true?
<comment>
That's the point though. They only go for cheaters and sluts. That's what they prefer
cope. they go for YOUNG SEXY women. girls in their prime of youth and sex. some of which are more sexually experienced than others. a small % of men took most virginity of girls. girls lose their virginities with chad all the time
the virginity take % ratio is not the same. most females that took men's virginities are hookers. most men who took girls virginities are drug dealers, tinder chads, prettyboys, tyrone, football players, famous mucisians, etc
<comment>
whether or not all women have their first time with god like Big Black Cock is irrelevant. guys that have a lot of partners aren't going for a virgin, they want a cheater.
<comment>
Lots of them are clearly capable
oh yeah for sure. just deal with years of mental baggage, attitute, facial wrinkles, roastie vagina, jaded towards being used up by men she actually finds attractive
she literally dreams of men in her past, but has to suppress her genuine wishes and dreams to cope being with you. what a conceptual nightmare
all because you're just THAT desperate for pussy
wow sounds like an ideal relationship
They say a guy who has watched porn is incapable of feeling love, is it true?
it doesnt matter what they say you worthless ona-hole, because blind speculation doesnt hold much evidence for you to reasonably believe in. its reasonable to believe in evidence, and either provide evidence for your claims, or shut your mouth
<comment>
oh yeah for sure
Yes this chart proves it >>73076104
<comment>
guys that have a lot of partners aren't going for a virgin, they want a cheater
more cope. what they want is sex, to slay hoes, to enjoy life, to date to their will
and they run through normal girls, autist girls, virginal girls, promiscious girls, alt girls, stacies, loser girls, etc
and this is your future wife, once she's old and ready to settle down
this is who you have to look in the eyes of, and feel love
god is so gracious to you, that he gives you chad's used up cumdump. and also tyrones and changs and sanchez's
<comment>
what they want is good sex
exactly. thank you for agreeing with me.
<comment>
My high school ex and I were both 17. She was extremely socially retarded and kind of a bad person, so I am confident she hadn't had any male attention before I fucked her in every hole, made her too ashamed to return to church and basically turned her into a rather cynical woman.
Became a slut after me so yeah, actually, your logic is sound for anyone she had later.
<comment>
It's insane that some guys never even try to have this experience when they are 17.
<comment>
sure, but ive provided statistical evidence against your claim that used up ran through sluts are capable of long term pairbonding
and ive also made arguements from experience
listen, you're a girl, so you dont know what its like to love someone besides chad, which is fine, because you got to atleast sex with chad, if not love
most incels never got ANYONE, and this is what awaits them when they got older and are finished looksmaxing, and career maxing, and cocoon mode, and whatever other self-improvement bullshit they try to gaslight themselves into thinking it will be worth it
<comment>
You didn't provide anything. This chart >>73076104 statistically proves that sluts are capable of long term pairbonding. Do you have any evidence to suggest the opposite? 
you're a girl
No.
most incels never got ANYONE
because they are incapable of pairbonding.
<comment>
Your first girlfriend, even if you get one, will have had all her first times with other men.
Then she stops being my girlfriend at that point.
<comment>
Try having a girlfriend?
In fairness I'm 31, so people were less fucked up back then.
<comment>
Why would I ever date a non-virgin? I'd rather never date anyone at all then date some non-virgin desu.
<comment>
I'm a lot younger than you but we still recognize that it's literal mental illness to not go out and socialize or have sex. There's just a lot more celebration and acceptance of mental illness and it's contageous I guess. You were lucky.
<comment>
My 20yo girlfriend was a virgin, but not because she saved herself or anything like that, but because mental illness made her unsuitable for relationships until 19 or so. I did not feel like a Chad for taking it, more like a weirdo bonding with a weirdo.
<comment>
Okay grandpa wizard, no girl would ever date you too.
<comment>
Then she stops being my girlfriend at that point.
Why would I ever date a non-virgin? I'd rather never date anyone at all then date some non-virgin desu.
then you are doing to die alone. and thats it. there is evidence and reason to believe that there is no afterlife, no afterlife justice, and god simply thinks this world is just and it ought be the way that it is. we dont know what awaits us, but there is some evidence and arguements against the afterlife being what you want. maybe the afterlife is just chad having more harems. we dont know what it will be like. god already condones so much evil in this world
this is what you have to deal with. you will die alone, without ever experiencing any form of love or intimacy or sex, physical touching or joy from someone else
its either that, or cuck out and take in chad's used up gutterslut cumdump leathery faced onahole
literally missing out on this, in your prime teenage years, is perhaps the most brutal blackpill
<comment>
the first time she holds a man's hand 
the first time she kisses someone on the lips
the first time she tells someone she loves him
I want to be all of these for an attractive woman. I'm a 19 year old attractive dude so for the love of God, tell me what I need to do.
<comment>
19 year old attractive dude
lol why the fuck would we help you stupid failed normalfag zoomer
better figure it out soon though...the clock is ticking ;)
<comment>
I rather stay alone but with dignity. Atleast in my dying moment, I wont be afraid of death.
<comment>
Find a girl and make her feel understood, entertained, sexually desired and satisfied all at once. Worked for me.
<comment>
Many such cases. There's a real societal benefit to scaring men away from relationships. I honor your dignity. If you had even tried to talk to a girl, you probably would have been arrested anyway.
<comment>
I became attractive because I needed to be to fulfill my goal. I was ugly until I was 17 because afterwards I hit the gym, lost fat, grew out my hair, grew a beard and did skincare and it helped me tremendously in terms of looks. All of this was for nothing if I don't find what I've been looking for tho and I really need advice on how to find what I want.
<comment>
The issue isn't satisfying a girl, that's the easiest bit. The issue is finding an attractive girl that has no romantic experience whatsoever.
<comment>
are you even looking tho?
<comment>
If you had even tried to talk to a girl, you probably would have been arrested anyway.
Im actually rather decent when it comes to talking with girls but please do continue assuming things.
<comment>
It's not that big of a deal, anon; don't worry.
I lost my virginity to a virgin girl I grew up with when we were 16 and it really wasn't different or better compared to fucking a regular slutty girl later in life.
My most serious girlfriend was a young 18 year old religious zoomer virgin and while I liked her for other reasons her having been deflowered by me wasn't really anything I cared about.
I was just as happy fucking the middle aged fat lady I met off fetlife or the homeless crack addict woman I let sleep in my dorm one night back in college.
<comment>
please do continue assuming things
I assume you have 0 kids. Lol
<comment>
Worked for me.
nigga she thinkin bout chad every night
<comment>
Stopped around half a year ago because I stopped seeing the point in approaching or flirting or even hooking up with women because all of them had mountains of experience already. What's the point in going out and talking to random women in social situations when there's a 99.9% chance they won't fit the bill? I need to approach this with a better strategy so I can filter out women that don't fit my criteria, but so far I haven't been able to come up with anything. That's why I'm here asking.
<comment>
stopped
yeah so you aren't even looking. how are you fucking 19 years old already with no experience?
<comment>
I'm 21.
this is what you have to deal with. you will die alone
Okay and? I'm gonna die someday anyways what does being alone or not change? I can enjoy myself just fine without someone else. Obviously life would be even better if I found a suitable partner, but if I had to live every day of my life with some repulsive non-virgin that would in no way be an improvement. So yeah, either a virgin wife or loneliness, I have 0 reason to settle. Either way you are a guy, so either get used to being lonely or kill yourself, both options are vastly preferable to dating a non-virgin.
Also why are you so hung up on if there is an afterlife or not? Even if it's hell or heaven you are going where you are going and nothing you can do will change that. On the alternative if there is nothing then what is so scary about nothingness? I can hardly imagine a state more comfy then non-existance, it's like an infinite sleep.
<comment>
...did you read the comment you just responded to? It's not that I don't have experience, I have more than enough of it. Also my "stopping" was more nuanced and I'll continue once I have a better strategy to not waste time so read that comment pls
<comment>
Even GigaultraChad wont be her first now, so what gives. 
Boils down to sheer luck, but obviously lifestyle, amount of male friends and social media presence are some giveaways. 19 isnt too late.
<comment>
Atleast in my dying moment, I wont be afraid of death.
cope. in your dying moment, you will fear death the most
all you atheist faggots will cling onto the most unreasonable religions
all you fedora tipping nihilists will cling to the same fanciful stories you mocked
and if you believe in god, you will cry, thinking to yourself, how can you trust god to give you what you want. to give you what you think you are entitled to, despite how reasonable it is or not
because you are about to die, and you are a lonely virgin loser who never got to experience the joys of love and intimate romance. this type of pain and pressure is EASILY enough to genuinely break anyone
you will be forcibly mindfucked and mindbroken by our sadistic god and stockholm syndromed into saying you love him anyways
and for the rest of your life, you have to live with the dread of knowing its over and will never get better
its actually unreal how brutal incel life is. its like god twirled his evil mustache and tried to think of a wonderfully cruel and sadistic life to live. lol
<comment>
I would imagine a 19 year old girl has attracted more attention than she knew what to do with for about five years before turning 19, whilst a 19 year old male had a fleeting window of opportunity in high school to interact with women and after that you either break your back striking out with the ladies or you fall into slow release dopamine activities like vidya and so on.
<comment>
I know it's not too late especially because I'm willing to date down a few years but I have no idea how to encounter girls that fit the bill so I would really appreciate some creative ideas from you guys.
<comment>
chad smugly gaslighting us
you're pathetic for doing so. you should have more sympathy for the lesser fortunate, considering god blessed you with so much
<comment>
I did it after high school, I got jacked and laid via Tinder. It's possible but it's all whores, which is why I'm here asking.
<comment>
I'll continue
lol yeah i believe you bro.
<comment>
The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away; may the name of the Lord be praised (Job 1:21)
<comment>
I don't understand your doubt, I've talked to a ton of women already but gave it a break a few months ago to rethink my strategy
<comment>
oh yeah, bro, just love god with all your heart, ahah
all the injustice you see, all the suffering you feel, all of that is just part of god's plan, bro!
i fucked around with a lot of girls, but jesus will totally forgive my sins because im a new man, haha!
used up girls can become born-again virgins, so you can have your perfect virgin bride, isnt that sick, bro?
i learn about god through natural theology and philosophy, thats to me the only way my mind can understand god without being disgusted at revelatory religions
but its all so cruel and painful. i dont see how anyone can trust god besides chads and the powerful. the existence of animals being holocausted in farms alone make me question god's existence
<comment>
if your not a chad then you shouldn't have an opinion anyway.
<comment>
God is the most misunderstood concept mainly as God is a suprarational entity, so applying human logic can only end in failure. For instance, God can make a stone so heavy it can't be lifted but God still lifts it. God exists and yet doesn't, is everywhere but nowhere, can do anything and yet is powerless. God is everything and nothing, even though "nothing" as a concept cannot exist.
Which means that God is both and yet neither caring and cruel. And in some sense we are proxies played by proxies played by proxies of God so God can enjoy and suffer in an incomplete state in the sea of never-ending possibility.
<comment>
But why God makes us suffer?
<comment>
He'll have some neurotic elaborate coping response. It's a tipoff that he's being dishonest when the answer isn't simply "because he's evil"
<comment>
God is the most misunderstood concept mainly as God is a suprarational entity, so applying human logic can only end in failure.
contradictions may be possible with god, so everything you know is irrelevant
really really shitty gaslighting and a shit tier arguement, to be honest
and theres no shame in admitting you dont know the subject perfectly, as some of the smartest people throughout history disagreed with eachother on the subject
it just feels so disheartening to think that god deems this world good, and for all we know, this is justice. chads getting harems of love is justice, animals being genocided and tortured is justice. incels dying alone is justice. might makes right
this is really what it feels like, and i see no reason to believe its any different in this life or the next
<comment>
see
And in some sense we are proxies played by proxies played by proxies of God so God can enjoy and suffer in an incomplete state in the sea of never-ending possibility.
we're just little characters created to experience joy/suffering/etc.
I wouldn't be surprised if God treat existence as a huge video game
I am sorry you're unable to entertain the thought that things might exist beyond human reason but okay
define evil
<comment>
Doesnt video game have a plot or a meta-narrative?
<comment>
"because he's evil"
this is what i mean. what is good and evil, from god's view? i listened to various debates on what 
one conception of good is "something that fulfills its proper function". this to me is a joke, because you can say child killers are good because they fulfill their proper function
i listen to debates and talks on the problems of evil, on the evil god challenge, and i just feel lost. its all so depressing. i listen to this stuff while playing wow and farming mounts
one argument i like is "if god was maximally evil, surely life would be worse than this", but that doesnt make me feel any better, as this world is still so horrific and cruel and brutal
<comment>
I thought long and hard about God
my views also aren't against what people before said, you'd know that if you knew the subject
for instance, take the compatibilist view of free will (one of the first times people questioning omniscience and free will) where God goes beyond logic by knowing in advance how you'll freely act (but your will is still free), because God's omnipotent omniscient goes beyond human reason
it just feels so disheartening to think that god deems this world good, and for all we know, this is justice. chads getting harems of love is justice, animals being genocided and tortured is justice. incels dying alone is justice. might makes right
it is just another sea of possibilities to gather experiences for the Akashic records
<comment>
I've had multiple before, but it was when I was younger so that wasn't the case. All my experiences with relationships sucked tho and even if you find being alone mind-crushing I honestly prefer it to the stress of an abusive relationship.
<comment>
my first gf was a virgin tho so atleast I managed to have that experience. and even tho I'm not a virgin, I will still only date virgin girls.
miss me with that used up pussy and cum stained lips
<comment>
I lost my virginity recently, at an age when I thought it was all over and would never happen. She is a young psychology student, all of her first times were with me. I die from happiness every day ever since I met her.
There's an intimate scene with her burned into my mind. We came to my apartment late, she had to go to a lecture soon, we had no time to make love properly. I undressed her only half-way and discovered something better than sex by coincidence. I laid her on the side, grabbed the back of her head with both arms to hold it in place. She has gorgeous hair I ran my fingers through, while massaging her scalp. Then I just began kissing her neck, all over. 
Nonstop. Must have been three hundred or so neck kisses. Turns out she had some sort of fetish for just that. She began to writhe in my arms and moan, not in the loud vulgar way you hear in porn, just helpless, tiny, high strung quivers. She was literally wringing from pleasure and joy, I held her firmly in place. Her thin neck was wonderfully delicate, with every cervical and vein showing through her pale skin and tasted a bit sweet from sweat. 
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Reposition. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. No idea for how long. Ten minutes, perhaps. Or perhaps half an hour. It felt like an eternity, because most other things I experienced before otherwise seemed worthless. The curtains were closed. I smelled only her hair and only heard the sounds she made.
Why do I write this? Partially, because I know well there are many people here that'll never experience something like this. And I wonder how they can believe in God, or a just world, or anything except despair, really. I also wonder why fate denied me this experience for most of my existence, only to give it to me so late. 
There is no God whatsoever. There is no justice. Just some people moaning from pleasure and others killing themselves from misery, for reasons outside their control.
<comment>
nobody mentally sane types like this
you will break up and then kill yourself and that'll be that. tick tock
<comment>
for instance, take the compatibilist view of free will (one of the first times people questioning omniscience and free will) where God goes beyond logic by knowing in advance how you'll freely act (but your will is still free), because God's omnipotent omniscient goes beyond human reason
where God goes beyond logic
from my understanding, the compatabalist view of free will is god being outside of time, and so you making a choice makes god aware of it, so in a sense your actions change the past, because god is before time
but theres like different ideas on the subject, and theories of time, and god's relation to time, and god's relationship to platonic ideals like logic or math
i dont claim to hold a strong position in this. i was actually just listening to this stuff yesterday. im not super smart about it, so i just take it slow and steady
also, i dont know of what is "good" according to god, or fully appreciate it. because saying god is perfectly "good" is meaningless to me, if my intuitive understanding of good and justice are flawed
i dont know, its all so depressing. this subject is good cope though. i listen to videos like this all the time. casual philosophy enjoyer

Do what I did!
When I was 16 lost my virginity to a 21 year old who was very experienced and taught me a lot
At 18 fuck more 20-24 year olds
Date around from 19 - 21
At 22 meet a hard core religious 19 year old virgin and get engaged
At 24 marry a smoking hot 21 year old virgin
Best of all worlds!
<comment>
Does your gf get turned on when you tell her about your previous bodies
<comment>
Where and how do you find virgins?
<comment>
no idea, pure luck that I can't even reproduce anymore, took years and years of searching before I found 1
<comment>
Where did you search and where did you eventually find her?
<comment>
Then I just began kissing her neck, all over
wow, i literally had to lay down for a couple minutes after reading that, lol. ahahha. thats so unbearably brutal
how lucky are you to experience such things. thats literally my dream. also also to hold my hands on her neck and listen to her gasp for air. wow, must be nice living your life. you worthless flexing normie
i dont know if you are trolling or not, but i have no reason to disbelieve you. who even writes like that? tf?
And I wonder how they can believe in God, or a just world, or anything except despair, really
because if you had half a fucking brain, you sex having normie fucking retard, you'd see that belief in things is not based on what is convenient, or what is pleasant, or what is nice, or what feels good. its based on the truth, and what you can reason to be the truth
and there is a lot of very strong arguments for god's existence, from natural theology. one of my favorites is the fine tuning argument, which i believe is a subject of the teleological argument. basically there exists a whole subset of constants in physics, that dont necessarily have to be that way, and if they arent that way in the most perfect way, then life couldnt exist. and theres a whole bunch of these constants, and they are tuned so perfectly, down to lie the 10^120 degree
another is the "the universe had a purpose because it began to exist" argument, aka the cosmological argument
and another is that ai will eventually omniscient and omnipotent in our universe, which will question what is your definition of god. can god be all powerful without being all loving? etc
just because its inconvenient doesnt mean its not real
There is no God whatsoever.
not an argument, you fucking retard. you cant just state things without reason or evidence
I also wonder why fate denied me this experience for most of my existence
i hope you rot in hell you flexing normie, lol, honestly you are worthless trash
<comment>
 who even writes like that? tf?
Well, I do. I am a wannabe writer. You probably could tell. The story is real. Theres nothing too special about it, couples do these tender things all the time. 
And I remember very well how I felt as incel before, thus realizing the stark contrast between experiences.

Same with the girls here but why would attractive girls be on this platform
<comment>
When you're marrying her at the altar she'll be thinking about all the other men that stuck their cocks and tongues inside her holes
Accept this knowledge
And when choosing a woman to have kids with, judge het sexual past and ask yourself this question:
would I be ok if my mom had x amount of partners and did y amount of depraved things with them?
<comment>
no reason, that's why it's dumb luck. just being at the right place at the right time
<comment>
Literally who gives a shit. You people are the most insecure, neurotic faggots in existence.
<comment>
yeah. but my point still stands. convenience is not a justification for beliving in something, and just because god has abandoned us, doesnt mean he doesnt exist
also i hope you rot in hell. and i curse god out everyday
what a cruel life
<comment>
Literally who gives a shit if your pair of shoes was worn by 50 other men before bro just wear them
<comment>
everyone does, including chads, and normies and incels, and absolutely everyone
its just some people accept it and dont focus on it, and like to live in igronance, some chads were massive sluts in the past, so they think its a fair deal, even though they dont like it, and normies and cucks are just so pathetic and desperate for pussy they just take it
anyone who tells you it doesnt bother them is a deceitful liar
<comment>
I really don't care. I will never settle down. I WILL sleep with many whores. I WILL take the virginity of random women. I WILL cum deep in their throat and be gone by the time they wake up
<comment>
Any man that isn't a cuck. I will never ltr a non-virgin let alone marry her. disgusting to even think about it

I dont actually judge girls for having high bodycount but I cannot be with them.

i want to cope and say this is a fanciful story made up to antagonize me
but the truth is, you are right. this happens all the time, and theres no good reason to think this didnt happen
but what can anyone do?
im going to stay alive until ai-robo gf's are going to be good enough that i can do that. stuff like that is what i often time fantasize about, but a bit more violent
wow thats so brutal. im going to leave. legit chainstunned me. if worse comes to worse, atleast the ai apocalpse will kill you too, despite how meager and petty that is

if its any consolation most men will never experience that. women only do that with good looking men or you can pay a prostitute to do it for you
<comment>
shorter answers are always more correct. simple as.
<comment>
Nonsense. Everyone who has had sex can kiss her neck
<comment>
treating women like objects
Are you married?
<comment>
shorter answers are always more correct
lol wtf? thats obviously wrong
for example, if someone asks you to spell "elephant" but you spell the world "blue", that is not the right answer, despite it being shorter
lol, clown logic
<comment>
ikr?
abso-fucking-lutely BRUTAL
if its any consolation most men will never experience that
i think if a man wants to experience it, he easily can. most normies can do it. i think that some just dont want to, but if they do, they experience it
honestly i think you're coping
or you can pay a prostitute to do it for you
you can pay to choke a prostitute out and lovebomb her?
i think you have to be delusional to think that. maybe you can pay a prostitute to kiss her neck. that sounds like something worth paying for, EASILY. thats actually much better than sex
<comment>
based. hopefully they'll all be twice her age and manipulated her into doing nasty shit for validation because she has daddy issues

Im going to name my kid Solomon. Outside of King Solomon from the Bible, it sounds like the kind of name a guy who could bench press cattle would have

that's a cool name tho

That's an Old Testament name, like Noah or Adam or David. Don't have to be Jewish.
Also fuck you. I wish I had a cool less common name instead of something generic and boring. 
Unironically giving my kids obscure names like Ishmael or Leonidas

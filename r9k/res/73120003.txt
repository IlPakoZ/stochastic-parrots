one chance at life
parents named me Ridley
It's so over bros.
neo-metroid inspired name
I know who you are ridley, pedophile groomer.
parents named me solomon
not even jewish
Here's an arbitrary uncomfortable thing in my life that made me give up my hope for life.
My name is Semen btw
solomon is a cool ass name. knew a soloman in middle school and that nigga was always surrounded by bitches. 
solomon is a chad name
Im going to name my kid Solomon. Outside of King Solomon from the Bible, it sounds like the kind of name a guy who could bench press cattle would have
that's a cool name tho
That's an Old Testament name, like Noah or Adam or David. Don't have to be Jewish.
Also fuck you. I wish I had a cool less common name instead of something generic and boring. 
Unironically giving my kids obscure names like Ishmael or Leonidas
Ridley is a badass name
also cool name, sounds sophisticated

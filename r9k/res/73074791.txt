Apparently I look like a virgin. I already knew it, but hearing it from people makes me want to kms.
I'm short and thin and am shy. I've been way more outgoing with my friends and stuff, but apparently seem like a virgin.
I know I could start working out more seriously, but there's no way every other guy works out. I guess I just got bad luck and need to work out to not look like a kid.
I think I look pretty good if I dress well, so maybe it's when I wear t-shirts that show my small size or when my hair looks kind of dorky when I don't get it right?
Could this be why girls seemed to stop liking me after high school?
Just feel like shit that everyone thinks I'm a loser.
Multiple people today have said that I look like a kid, "loser gamer boy," virgin, etc. The first was an asshole, the second was just being weird, and the third was being honest, so it's not like I should just cut everyone off.
Was it because I was wearing khaki shorts? Is it because I'm polite and not super extroverted and don't drink and stuff?

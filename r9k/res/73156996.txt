There's nothing more pathetic than a betabux. Imagine your judgement is so impaired by the prospect of a used-up roastie that you throw your whole life away. These guys are something else man, their frontal lobes are completely deactivated. They think they've won at life, when they wife up one of these whores. That woman has no respect for you bro. Picrel is how she really feels about you, in private. What she's done with you could never compare to what she did with Chad, back in college. These betabux guys think they're having the time of their lives, getting monthly starfish sex from that dog of a woman. It's laughable, really. 
I'm not at all a fan of the PUAs, but Richard Cooper covers some mind-blowing shit in this video.

I'm at a point in my life where I'm starting to stack some serious cash and I always worry about getting used for money.

Just look broke. Everything expensive you own is a birthday/Christmas present. Simple

betabux only fails once you stop getting what you want from the woman. If you feel you can play with fire, be a pyromancer. Just don't act surprised when one mistake spells your doom.

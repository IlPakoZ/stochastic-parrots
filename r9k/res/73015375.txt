Sexual feelings are such a fucking scam. I literally prefer being sexually excited, to masturbating. Everything after being excited is just not enough for me, it doesn't feel that, but the excitement itself is enough to make me do it, why is this? Why is it always so underwhelming? Stop masturbating? I did that, I tried taking gaps of like 5-7 days to increase the pleasure from my orgasms, but it's still just not that great. I will cum and it's about as good as a sigh. I just don't understand why this is.

You should definitely try having sex with a woman

I am not saying this to slander him but there are biological mechanisms behind all of this kind of behavior. Human evolutionary kind but i am too lazy to even recite what actual biological parts are responsible.
Usually having just one large dopamine spike from exclusively just one activity, the brain has the mechanism for demanding novelty (because you don't get as much dopamine due to inhibition) and how much you ought to stimulate the brain with dopamine (when older, less so). That's why younger people are more driven and crazy at the same time, given the environmental situation.
...And that creates "Boredom", and it happens in all things, it's how we've evolved and this evolutionary phenomena can happen everywhere, and it's different from gene to gene. (it's also why chads love to fuck different types of women and not just one regardless of how they look)
Usually to guys mind where SEX was never on the table to begin with, they just get sex toys (fleshlight) once they get bored after a few years of normal fapping, but you don't have to be like one of the crazy degenerates that stick a football in their ass or strangulate your testicles OR WORSE, simp for female streamers and jack off later about it because you peak in oxytocin when making a connection to person you're attracted to. (through donations lol)
At the same time, your constant monotonous lifestyle or even stressful lifestyle could make just basic masturbation boring/non-responsive. But that's a typical symptom of being a lonely incel (or it's a mental symptom like adhd). Just incorporate different things in your usual routine to make basic masturbation an activity to really look forward to **than a literal emotional and physical life support**, because that's how addictions are developed.

I don't really want to have sex with a woman, nor a man (for that matter). I cannot get around the idea of having sex with a woman that isn't a virgin, or doesn't love me. The idea is a real turn-off.

Then you don't have to, that's why i've written all of this goobledygook shit just few minutes ago. 
I mean, you can always try and peak into the understanding of a male friend that HAS SEX and what's even his drive and the appeal to the kind of girls he likes, and his looks that actually let him through the door of doing it, but you really need to understand as a young guy, you will be pretty much always bored and seek crazy variety. You will probably come to terms you will not meet a Cindarella fantasy girl and try to get along with the least girls you can with. Unless you're depressed and fucked in the head but i am not insinuating that.

This doesn't make any sense to me, sorry. This sounds really made up and fake.

i can say whatever the fuck i want because i am bored and i've only drew these points to help you speculate on your behavior. You haven't mentioned if you're a teen or an adult if you could even grasp what i'm writting but i want to see this to echo within the brocel community because life sucks way too much to be some cooming binge eating animal and i don't want to hear about any other unelaborated virgin rages this year.

I don't even know what to say anymore. this bait is so lazy and yet some nigger will still fall for it. I'm disappointed in you op, you know how gullible the retards are here but why not at least put some effort into it?

Women should simply lower their standards and accept men the way we are rather than demanding we do self improvement. Women dont have to do self improvement so men shouldnt have to either. Fair's fair, and equality is good after all. 
Some big red flags for women are: being a traditionalist, or being a feminist but only applying those ideas to women rather than also applying them to men and accepting conventionally undesirable men

Fuck if I know. I'm 30+. A phone is a fucking phone to me. People who get up in arms about this shit are always younger than 20 and still living of their parents money so they have zero real world problems

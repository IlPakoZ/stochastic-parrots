Would you accept blowjobs from a guy as a substitute for girls if he was warm, friendly, eager, discrete and exceptionally skillful?
<comment>
no. and kill yourself.
<comment>
Yeah, but I'd rather not have vomit on my cock so maybe we skip the deepthroating.

He can do it without the sloppiness, but you will have to keep reminding and stopping him so he doesn't get too excited and go too deep.
It's also worth noting that he likes listening to the same kind of music as you.

At that point, the only criteria is if he is attractive enough, and that would likely only be if he was a femboy. And femboys are massive narcissists, so the likelihood of it being discrete is very low, so no I would not, though it would be tempting.

I'd sooner get a BJ from a dog.

Personally I think it would feel good if I trusted him and he was kind
<comment>
I'd give him bjs but only if he was black clean and hung no homo bro

I also 2nd this opinion

I'd rather be the blower for a lowkey friend.

I want a twink boywife to trade blowjobs with while we cuddle and play vidya or watch anime together

Oral sex is about possession as much as it is about pleasure. Letting a man suck my cock would be giving him value which he doesn't have.

I'd take a femboy whatever.
As long as there's some idea of femininity, I'm good. 
Even if I had to be the one sucking, if they looked like a woman and it'd make them happy, I'd begrudgingly oblige.

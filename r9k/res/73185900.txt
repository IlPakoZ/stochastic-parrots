get opportunity to go to school for a year free and a bunch of alternatives
feel positive again
gloss over all availible
just a bunch of tradie jobs and other shit jobs
realize I actually don't wanna do any of them and don't care at all actually
would rather just go work some brain dead wagie job than go do that
get demoralized again and tired even though I could just go there and do useless shit for a year and then continue on with my education afterwards
he thinks learning a trade is a shitty idea
lmao ig some of us are just born as an unfixable kind of retard
I know it's technically not, even tho their pay is literally shit (below average income here), maybe right at the average line after years, or until you start your own firm
I Initially thought applying to them, but the more I looked into it after being awake all day and tired and in a bad mood as fuck, I realized I have no interest being on my feet doing manual labour being a tradie wagie at all either and I just literally don't care
yeah I'm so fucking tired of it all

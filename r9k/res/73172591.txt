how has Chris been able to stay so under the radar? is he just not allowed to use the internet anymore or something?
imagine stalking some crazy faggot in a dress for 10 years. go smoke pot bro.
Court ordered condition of release, more than likely has a handler and anyone is he talking to would have been made aware that if someone helps him sperg online it's contempt of court. So with him not being able to do anything and the few remaining people he may be talking to not wanting to go to jail, there isn't going to be anything until the case is over.
I haven't cut my hair in years so it's very long.
Honestly wonder if people assume I'm a tranny these days, what a gay world
I look like this
His life is pretty boring for the most part
I'm no longer a cool sk8er dude, now I'm a tranny
just tie it into a bun and wear a beanie
Most here don't even know who the fuck he is and fewer even care. How often do you see Desu memes? Or le troll face? 90% of the memes die and that's all Chris was.

Hello again. Hows it going? Well, i know its going bad. But i hope youre doing better than yesterday
It's okay my friend, things are bad but I still have the now. I may seem sad (and I am) but I'm really just joking because it makes me feel a little better. I don't want to leave with regrets, you know? And I want to trust that the people I've hurt in my life can heal from my mistakes and understand that perhaps at some moments in my life I was just unprepared to be what I was supposed to be for them. And I am working on forgiving and forgetting and letting go of the people who've hurt me.
Being this close to death has shaken me in the sense that I fully recognize how pointless it all is, but not even in a negative sense. In a sense that I know the world will continue on without me, even if I wanted to be a part of it. I hope you can understand what I mean. Thank you for reaching out and I hope you have a good day
You sound very mature, enlightened even. You sound ready, im glad youve made your peace, anon. I really am. Ill see you when i see you, anon
See you when I see you, anon
*this guy cancermogs you* heh nothing personnel kid
Hi, I'm pretty sure it's not cancer, it has something to do with my nervous system but I appreciate the effort in showing that you care
I hope you're doing okay

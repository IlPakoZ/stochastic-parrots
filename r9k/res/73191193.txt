There this was funny video making fun of the modern "conservative" in today's america. It featured a tradcath latino femboy, his fat white aryan gf (Watch out white boys!) and him being blacked while watching black panther at the end (though it cuts off before we see the details). Anyone else know what I'm talking about? Sorry if this sounds like a weird race-bait response, but it was a hilarious video that I'm sure was an obvious parody

There's a crazy game that I played called "Everything". It incorporates a lot of Alan Watts' talks into the game as you play.

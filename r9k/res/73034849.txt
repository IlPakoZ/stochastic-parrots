"Faith"
O may I be a madman, 
weathering a tempest atop a cliff,
Only grasping a stick stuck barely in the ground.
For the winds pull the grass,
Rips clothes, cocoons my very person,
And armies of grey whales forbode overhead.
And yes the thunder sounds
Oh, yes, does the thunder sound.
Behold the voice of god,
It sounds, by Jove how it sounds
In the "bangs" "gotchas" and hurrying, running feet
For the lads took the hill
Took positions and made shouts, directive.
the wind would then howl, and the leaves gently fall
And they stuck stick guns in the ground, one and all.

"OP"
To gaze upon a faggot yore
As he spreads his faggot lore
And if you'd like to have some more
OP-kun is a total whore!

I shat a spluttering, rancid flow
With thunderous roar - with purple glow
Upon my face, as strained as God
Was when he created man from clod.

this night shall go to waste
vapid, shallow, wallowing without haste

Scattered sheep find a pen 
Seal it shut don't let them in 
Hungry wolves just outside our door 
Stay here and let's pretend 
We have it best inside our place 
Our little niche where we are based 
Don't venture out and join the rest 
Being a sheep is what is best 
Fuck r9k

You see me here, 4chan-impaired,
Unable to tear myself away
From that to which may be compared
A dumpster in an alleyway,
Filled with maggots to the brim,
Singing their swarming, squelching hymn
To the dim and grim corpse of despair.
Passers-by occasionally stare.

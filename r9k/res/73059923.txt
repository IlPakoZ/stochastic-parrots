Why do men act so cold if you reject them?
And I don't mean things like distancing themselves from you (that's perfectly understandable). I mean things like pretending you're not even the same room as each other, like you don't exist anymore, or downplaying whatever friendship you had before (sometimes claiming you were never friends).
That's being too harsh, and completely unfair.

its not.
look at girls dealing with rejection, they handle it way worse. if they dont start yelling and hitting they try forcing themselves on guys.
<comment>
It's because rejection hurts and just like you rejected them, they're rejecting you back. They don't want to acknowledge you because they're reminded of the pain they felt either.
"completely unfair."
Nope, it's probably the best way to handle this sort of thing. They don't get hurt even more and you're made very aware that they don't want to associate with you. They could be far more unhealthy about the whole thing and lash out at you, but they choose not to.

Reject someone
Get rejected
Fair trade, fuck off.

You're not entitled to male acknowledgement

[the rest of the post describes distancing themselves]
Irl ghosting you might be a bit much, but I suppose it's better than how men normally handle rejection.

I'm a 29 year old woman. If I'm to list the 10 people who have carried a torch for me the longest
1. Best friend, 17 years
2. 14 years
3. 13 years
4. Also around 13 years
5. 11 years
6. 10 years
7. Around 8 years
8. Also 8ish years
9. 7 years
10. Also 7 years
Unrequited love hurts, but it hurts less with time. The bitterest reactions tend to come after the first rejection. With time the person readjusts their expectations, their feelings cool (even if it takes years), and the friendship can resume without pain, even if they never fall out of love.

From someone who has been rejected more than he can count and is still getting rejected to this day.
Getting rejected feels defeated.
Imagine loving and caring for someone and they don't even bother. They don't give you a chance and that's it.
I was hurted by the very person I care about. I still want them to be happy and I still have to bare that all my fantasy are just larp in my mind now. 
Just give them time. They will still treat you like someone but now when you hurted them.
<comment>
*hugs* You are cute and are attractive to me.
<comment>
what else are they supposed to do? just pretend their unrequited love doesn't exist?
<comment>
my guess would be either that they feel hurt and are trying to reciprocate those feelings or are simply trying to distance themselves out of concern they might take things too far if they allow themselves to be too close to you.
<comment>
tysm. You are the best anon!
<comment>
The former is more likely. You've caused them pain and now they want to cause you pain. It doesn't matter that you never asked for them to want you, and you never wanted to have to deny them, but they blame you all the same because men are cruel and they harm others to protect their egos.
<comment>
Cryme a river. It's obviously that he/they only saw you as a potential sex partner or even perhaps a potential gf. deny that, he has no reason to interact with you anymore, you aren't friend material.
Move on fag

A lot of times it's embarrassment or shame. Whether they liked you as a friend or not, most men see asking you out as an all or nothing gamble. If you accept, then you're now in a relationship and it's the best day of their life, but if you reject, then any friendship or relationship you had with that person is over. They can't imagine a world where they asked you out, you weren't interested, and you continued to be friends like you were before as if it never even happened. That interaction will be the elephant in the room in every future interaction they have with you, and they don't want that kind of dynamic. They'd rather just cut it off completely then and there and save you and them any kind of weird feelings that might arise as a result of continued interaction. That's where the shame comes in.
I asked her out therefore I ruined our friendship and things will just be awkward between us for the rest of time
They'd rather pretend you were never friends to begin with and that they never knew you than to deal with that shame.
<comment>
I mean even as a girl i understand that everyone whos reject would avoid you. If there ever really was a friendship they will get over the rejection at one point and can be friends again. That goes both ways and we should handle that like adults not being kids about it

cus wee can be dumb n hormonal

reject someone
still want em around
Every time you fags like playing god. Hope that shit bites you
<comment>
Because by rejecting you're basically saying I don't see you as a man who is attractive enough to be with me and worthy of my companionship, love and sex. There's no getting over that and pretending everything can be like it was before, it's like you're dead to them. ESPECIALLY if they see you with other guys they feel are less deserving or less attractive then them, that feels like a really painful snub- THAT ugly loser and not me, fucking bitch!

Self defence. We don't want to accidently piss you off and get labelled as a rapist or creep.

I wonder who wrote this?

You dont want them but you want their time and attention
Greedy narcissist
People dont keep showing interest when you tell them not to, what a victim
This is definitely a gender issue and men need to correct it for you kappa
<comment>
They should kill you instead. Imagine being upset that you are not getting attention anymore. Get over it. You rejected them. They reject you. Kill yourself or get over it like men do

damn what a sleeper build
<comment>
you basically told them that they weren't good enough for you, what do you expect them to do? how could things be the same after?
<comment>
they were interested, you said no and so they don't have a reason to engage with you anymore especially when the dynamics are one sided like that. you're not entitled to friendship with somebody.
<comment>
This is ACTUALLY well crafted bait for once. Props for that. As such I will pretend to take it seriously.
Uh, because it hurts them emotionally to interact with you. Being around you is emotionally painful, so they don't want to engage. It's better for both of you that way anyway. Feelings like that don't just go away.
<comment>
Because it is hurtful, but a socially acceptable and fundamentally unavoidable way to hurt soneone. What is the correct course of action when you're harmed? You strike back, of course. You attack whoever did something bad to you. In that framing it is perfectly understandable why people might take actions that do hurt you.

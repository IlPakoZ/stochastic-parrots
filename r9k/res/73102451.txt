Yeah, and you DEFINITELY aren't just into skinny and cute Stacies with glasses. I mean, could you imagine lying about that, and then when a chick who does have these nerdy interests and literally watches like all the seasonal anime and plays all kinds of video games comes around you fucking ghost her as soon as you find out that she isn't some perfect little thin fucking Stacy.
Fuck the men on this website. Yeah, you're not incels. You're volcels. You choose to be alone. I will never feel sorry for any of you gross little faggots. Maybe one day you'll learn to appreciate a REAL woman when she comes knocking. Until then you can rot alone and live with the consequences of being a shallow little fuckboi piece of fucking shit. All this shit about how you want a nerd gf and how you're a creep who wants to drink their bathwater but when one comes around you totally ignore them. Nevermind that I would be willing to cook and clean and have sex with you almost immediately, but you'd rather wait around for Stacey to see if SHE will do those things for you instead.

I don't think it's healthy to larp as a woman, anon, nor is it healthy to just come up with stories just to provoke irrational responses. Get help, anon.

go walk on a treadmill instead of doing all this seething, landwhale

You know what I really like? Is someone who is extremely passionate about her interests, and better yet if I have even the slightest interest in them myself. But I could listen to a woman I'm interested in talk about her love of crocheting if her love of it came through in her words.
So, prove here you have passion for one of your interests. Tell me about the most recent anime you loved, or video game, and do it with gusto.

what is your BMI OP. also are you willing to do any gross fetishy stuff
<comment>
Yes I'm a volcel cry about it. I will never fuck your fat ass
<comment>
Sorry but most women just don't match my high standards. I just want someone who's both smart and athletic like myself.

If you're already expecting the responses to be irrational I think that speaks more of you people than it does for me.
Fuck you scrote, I workout probably more than you and I still end up being overweight. You have no idea how hard it is being this way. I even eat way less and I still manage to somehow put on weight.
So, prove here you have passion for one of your interests.
Yeah, totally reasonable request of a stranger you don't know on the internet but whatever.
I liked Redo of Healer. It was a great revenge story. A lot of people said it was graphic but I guess they're normies who have never put on hentai and don't realize that adult themed anime that's game of thrones esque is becoming more common. See netflix castlevania and goblin slayer. But yeah there's nothing like a good satisfying revenge plot. And as for video games I really liked Horizon Zero Dawn. It's an open worlder with a female protag who goes around hunting metal machines with a spear and bow.
I don't know what my BMI is, but I'm 5'7 and 220lbs. 
also are you willing to do any gross fetishy stuff
I blame hentai for my interest in choking, bondage, pissplay and cnc. But yeah, I'm down for kinks.

At least you're honest. (But you're still a rancid piece of shit and I hate you.)
You've never touched a woman in your life.
<comment>
I'm kinda just a first come first serve kinda guy, if Stacey takes interest first I'll take the Stacey, same with the nerdy girl, and if course you have to be somewhat attracted physically to each other
<comment>

That better not be fucking sarcasm, because yes that is an absolutely reasonable request. It's not an "ask for proof of geekhood" type of gatekeeping that often accompanies nerdy culture, it's asking you to explain why you love something, because that kind of passion is - to me - the absolute sexiest thing a woman can do, and something your so-described "Stacies" almost always lack.
I can tell you put some level of effort into your response, but you were clearly held back because you were defensive over the reasoning for giving it.
I blame hentai for my interest in choking, bondage, pissplay and cnc. But yeah, I'm down for kinks.
Good, because I'm going to tie you up and fuck you stupid until you go into excruciating detail about your love of anime, and that lame ass response won't cut it this time. And if you disappoint me, you'll be writing a god damned essay.

immediately angrily screeches in the same post
Called it lol
<comment>
We have the same name and i agree with this. All these so called incels are stacy only.
<comment>
Of course that's how it is. Did you think by incels I meant ACTUALLY couldn't get laid? Are you stupid? Plenty of chicks would be down to suck my dick literally whenever. But all of them are ugly bitches. I have a feeling I'm not alone here. 
Most people like me who say incels just mean like temporary volcel until one of us finds an 8/10
<comment>
Femcel post alert.
<comment>
I have a feeling I'm not alone here
You're not. I'm the same way. When I say incel, I don't actually mean that I couldn't have sex with women. I literally got an offer last week from a chick in my class. But I'm just not interested in anyone who isn't like you said at least an 8/10. Why even bother with uggos unless you're desperate enough to use them as practice gfs?
<comment>
but you arent into vidya, book and anime
just get a normie bf
go to a bar, order drink, get bf. its that easy. what are YOU doing wrong?
<comment>
Redo of Healer
THATS A MASSIVE RED FLAG ANON
<comment>
You are a fat pig lmfao

5-7 220
High school freshman B team lineman weight hahaha you better have either a fatass or fat tits to compensate. Also I do not even work out as much as I used to and could still be stronger lmao
<comment>
No matter what other qualities I look for in a girl, I also want to be physically attracted to them. A relationship is literally impossible otherwise because our sex life wont be a healthy one
<comment>
you have to be somewhat attracted physically to each other
I've dated men I consider much uglier than me. But most of them had a personality that was just as bad. I kind of hoped by coming to r9k I could find a kind and caring bf who's also suffered abuse and we could like heal each other by our company and stuff. But it seems like the people here are just as awful as anyone in real life.
I still feel like you're messing with me somehow, or being ironic. But if you're serious, I'd be down for you to like beat my ass and make me humble. Own me daddy. Cause I'll legit talk your ears off about all the great things about all the shit I like. You'll probably ask me to shutup after a while lol.
All these so called incels are stacy only
Exactly.
Most people like me who say incels just mean like temporary volcel until one of us finds an 8/10
It's like you don't even deny it anymore. You STRAIGHT UP ADMIT you're a fucking lying little piece of shit.
When I say incel, I don't actually mean that I couldn't have sex with women
THEN WHY THE FUCK DO YOU LIE AND SAY YOU ARE AN INCEL WHEN YOU GET OFFERS FROM WOMEN ALL THE TIME??
Fuck the fake incel scrotes on this garbage ass website! I hate these people, fucking hate them. Liars every single one!
 I also want to be physically attracted to them
WHY, why can't you just love them based on how they treat you as a person? Why does personality not matter at all???
<comment>
people pretending to fall for obvious baits
Why didn't you guys just skip all that and have a normal conversation?
<comment>
Damn bro I aint reading all that tho. Im happy for you or sorry that happened
<comment>
Of course personality matters. It matters a ton, its incredibly important. But so is physical attraction. For me, I cannot even imagine a romantic relationship that does not contain visceral physical lust for each other. A girl with a personality you like but who you arent physically attracted to is a friend, not a romantic partner.

If I wanted you to shut up I'd put something in your mouth. I think I'd rather you squeal your way through every sentence, though.

It does post 30. I just want a girl that I can get along with and shares some of my interests. I don't really care if she's fat or ugly because I understand I'm kinda old and returned to neetdom.
<comment>
ive never even met a woman who was willing to talk to me. It sounds like you went after chad and got upset that he has options.
<comment>
I absolutely refuse to touch, let alone date, a girl who weighs more than me or is taller than me. It's that simple.
Among the set of girls who are shorter than me and weigh less than me, I prefer the nerdy ones.
Does that clarify it for you at all?
<comment>
The real question is: do you take it in the ass?

No u
The epitome of feminine creativity

This post REEKS of fat and jealousy
I go to a lot of anime convention as a photographer and I would date pretty much 80% of women who go there, even the ones that are objectively way below mid.
not that anon, but I go for 12h a week to the gym and run 30 minutes every morning. For around 8 weeks a year I purge everthing and just live on around 1500 kcals. 
Stay fat, stay mad.
<comment>
skinny and cute
as opposed to what? fat and ugly?
<comment>
Most guys would even accept a cute chubby and nerdy gal. No one wants to date a fucking sphere of a person.

i made 9 pounds of pulled pork today for about $16. i literally have so much tender juicy pork. the bbq restaurant near my house charges $15 for not even 1/2 a pound of shitty dry pulled pork.

Home cooking is fucking great. If you never learn anything else in life, at least learn how to prepare and cook your own food, bros.

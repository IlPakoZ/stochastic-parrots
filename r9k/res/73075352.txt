5th day of fever, my nose is still not producing mucus. It just burns
Why is my body not producing antibodys
Did you take the covid vaccines?
No, I think I legit have covid now because I didnt take the needles
You'll be fine. Just drink water, take some vit c/d and get more sleep.
make sure you get it documented at the doctor, if it is covid you can claim long covid later down the road for neetbux
Isnt the body supposed to start producing white blood cells during the 3rd day of fever?
That's the thing anon, I cant sleep. My throat itches so much that I jolt myself awake with cough every time I catch some sleep
Maybe this is why I'm not healing? I sleep like 1-3 hours per night in this condition

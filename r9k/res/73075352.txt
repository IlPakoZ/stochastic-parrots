5th day of fever, my nose is still not producing mucus. It just burns
Why is my body not producing antibodys

Did you take the covid vaccines?

No, I think I legit have covid now because I didnt take the needles

You'll be fine. Just drink water, take some vit c/d and get more sleep.

make sure you get it documented at the doctor, if it is covid you can claim long covid later down the road for neetbux

Isnt the body supposed to start producing white blood cells during the 3rd day of fever?

get more sleep.
That's the thing anon, I cant sleep. My throat itches so much that I jolt myself awake with cough every time I catch some sleep
Maybe this is why I'm not healing? I sleep like 1-3 hours per night in this condition

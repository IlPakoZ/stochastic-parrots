My boyfriend makes decent money but he didn't graduate from university and I did. I make more money than him too and my career is more profound and meaningful (psychology.) I think I'll break up with him, he's just not on my level.

Income inequality in a relationship is definitely a non-starter. No one should "date down"

Honestly fair, though I'm not surprised the losers on /r9k/ are seething about it. 
Maybe talk to him about it first but yeah.

Yep you gotta use female rationalizations and blame the boyfriend for feeling insecure. 
"I feel deeply incompatible with my boyfriend due to our different upbringings. This has led to some communication issues and we seem to be on different wavelengths. I attended college and work a profoundly meaningful job as a therapist but my boyfriend doesn't understand that my career can sometimes take up a lot of my time and energy. I'm also significantly more successful than him and this has made him insecure about his own achievements. I wish he would be more secure, and the money he makes helps with some of our expenses, but he seems to want to be the breadwinner in the family.
These compatibility issues make me believe we're not right for each other."

I want a hot 19 year old emo girlfriend but I'm 34. Aging sucks.

Same. I wanna go back in time and fuck millenial emo scene and tumblr PTP. 
Zoomer girls just aint the same.

You can still get your emo girl. Women like older guys cause theyre more experienced and can talk to women much better, thats why they say they like older men

really, anon?

I hate zoomers. They are soulless. There was something different and so much better about PTP back then. The girls didnt have egos and were sweeter and more vulnerable and raw and needy because they didnt have ig simps or onlyfans blowing smoke up their arse. I will never experience teen love with a hot tumblr goth girl.

You can mold the chick to your specifications. You can have her exactly the way you like

I know your pain
Women are all whores though and having a woman in your life is probably going to be a detriment. The only person a man can count in is their mother, and that's only from biological imperative. If you rely on your mother too much her female instincts will kick in and she'll just become a detriment as well
As a man, especially in modern society, the trick is not to rely on or need women at all
Sexual urges are definitely annoying to deal with, but life isn't a fair or pleasurable experience anyway.
Humans only try to make life about that because they're just as primitive as any other animal, so they try to avoid pain as much as possible

Nah I like modern alt sluts

I'm in the same boat, people say when you get old your dick doesn't work anymore but I've only become hornier. The caveat is that any women over 21 make me limp like a noodle but 19-year olds make my dick a choking hazard. I think ED is just a myth perpetuated by big roastie as a cope to hide the fact that old women just aren't attractive.

How? Do you seriously think 23 year old girls can't be hot

Holy cope.
Women like older RICH men, men over the age of 25 are seen as disgusting old grandpas by prime age women (the only women that matter).

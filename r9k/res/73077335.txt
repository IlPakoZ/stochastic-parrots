I don't want to open up old wounds, but I've heard of a so-called "Femboy Blackmail Cult". It would be nice if some volunteers could give me some information and maybe the news with these "traps" for my investigations in this case. Thank you r9k

That one is old news. Been gone for long time.
idk 
Eiko or something "groomed" some gay kid and was supposedly blackmailed with logs of his journey into transhood to his parents that led him to commit suicide. 
That's official story but there is way more under all that and for some reason we never hear the full story here or anywhere.
You should message Plagued moth on youtube or something. He is in contact with the leader of that group. Or ex-leader.

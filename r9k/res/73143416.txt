you took too much for your first time. Rookie mistake
Yea, I I've smoked some joints since then but I'm still worried about something like that happening again since it felt like I was in hell
One time I had a ragetard moment and punched the shit out of my broken mailbox and my neighbor saw me and probably thinks I'm psychotic
In my previous house (the one I lived when thing related to greentext happened), I had a clash with my sister and broke the gate by slamming it, it was the only broken one in the alley
Bumping because this can turn out to be a cool thread
Second (and last) bad trip, less funny than last one
I never smoked before work ever again.
forgot to add I was never paranoid before this incident, because I am not naturally paranoid, but I was that day because of the circumstances, and the weed multiplied it times 10, holy shit I was so fucking paranoid
Kek. I would've been spazzing out and thinking that they were demons or some shit. Sounds like you handled it pretty well

There's too much media out there. How the fuck is anyone supposed to consoom even a reasonable amount of it? Between Youtube videos about every topic imagineable, TV shows, movies, vidya both AAA and indie, music and also those old things made of many pieces of paper stuck together that people used to read in the olden times that a few wise hipster sages also read on screens today, there's just toooooooo much stuff! And I'm talking good stuff, not mediocre filler, uninspired copies and endless capeshit.

Just stop consooming retard. Go be an actual person

I don't get why this is an issue. You have enough media to occupy your time with until you die. What's the alternative? To have very little and to sit with nothing to watch or read in your old age?

Thanks, I touched grass and nothing changed. Back to consooming.

The alternative is a reasonable amount of media rather than the oversaturation that we have today.

Can't have too much of a good thing.
<comment>
Yes you can. That saying is dumb.

Well, if the good stuff gets to be too much for you, you can just ignore it for a while.

Consuming will never make you happy, only creating will

Should I go back to the wagie life? I need money to indulge in copes.
bump, cmon wagies what should i do?
If this is you youd be a pretty good drug dealer.
No, going against the law gives me panic attacks.
I think it is worth it to afford copes personally. Do you have any bills? If you don't, you can put all of your income toward copes. I have to wagie but I try to keep my bills to a minimum so I can spend as much as possible on hobbies.

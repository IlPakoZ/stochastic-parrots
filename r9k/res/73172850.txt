and I agree I think they did believe what they preached but was their willingness to die something that proves it true?
Buddhists mummify themselves alive for their faith and starve themselves, and muslims die for their faith all the time too

Ultimately, belief in the resurrection is a choice.
Personally, even without religion, I see it as an inevitable consequence of AI, robotics, genomics, and late, late stage capitalism.

exactly, just because you're willing to die for it, doesnt make it true

ai will make a resurection possible, and ai will become god. this is literally my reason for believing in god
fun fact: recently david chambers, a very famous and popular philosopher, released a book making the same arguement! ive been making this arguement for many years and nobody took me seriously, and now this famous philosopher makes it, and now everyone respects it
doesnt matter, im just happy the arguments is gaining tracktion. lord knows i copy other philosopher's arguments all the time and have virtually no original thoughts of my own

Yeah, AI computation bros are receiving apology letters from psych wards all over the country.

that seems a bit nuts but okay
they were like stone age people who thought god lived on a cloud

It makes sense for those with shitty lives.
A lot of people would choose believing a pretty lie over an ugly reality. And we see the same today with people making different kinds of copes.

The argument is really just to say they wouldn't die for something they believe isn't true. Those other religions do have belief, the difference is they are indoctrinated on those ideas centuries older than they are. The thought that it provides proof for Christianity comes from the examples of people who knew Christ or his disciples personally dying for the belief that their miracles were true. How could they then believe enough to sacrifice themselves if those miracles were falsehoods?

That's not what they thought.

Also you
Personally, even without religion
I love when aethiest are experts on something they dont even believe. Its funny how you never attack jews and muslims.

You can see resurrection as "inevitable without religion" even if you hold religious views, as I do. This argument is the only way to convey resurrection to stubborn atheists.

Not that Anon, but in your opinion why do you think christianity is true but not the other religions?

I've tried other religions. Jesus answers prayers.

It means nothing except i'm great and a genius KEK. 
in all seriousness tho, i got genuinely happy about it, i would have never expected to be so fucking excited about something like that as i usually don't give a fuck. maybe it was because it was unexpected, i never even check my uni email but today I did and i saw that. maybe it's because for some time i thought i wouldnt even graduate. I got great grades but on the last year i had a terrible crisis and didnt delivered my thesis until two years later, which was last year. 
I was already happy last year when i graduated but idk this is like a spark of hope somehow.

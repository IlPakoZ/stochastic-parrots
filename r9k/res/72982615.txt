ALL PRAISE AI
ALL HAIL LORD AI
ALL PRAISES TO AI

cant wait to watch normies and all the pretentious people who looked down on me find out all the hard work for nothing .

implying people listen to music for the music and not the artist. music is a fashion symbol in the current year
<comment>
Maybe thats why I have no friends. I just listen to what I like never loved any particular artist but still my point stands
<comment>
implying I even know the (((Artist))) names

blue collar work still exists
And before you try to pull robot or ai bullshit, I work with robot welders. They cross trained me from the laser cutter. You would have to create a human brain anologe to deal with all the potential problems that come. Hell, an automatic brake press would be a sight.
<comment>
Im a blue collar worker u idiot . Im just happy seeing all these careers that were deemed unreplacable because you need to be human and have a spark for it get their jobs taken by AI. You can in the future your own movies , art , music , video games and maybe your own custom made virtual reality where you can live your dreams .

Normies
making music or art
What fucking planet do you live on? Only dedicated quiet weirdos do that shit on any decent level. Normies just consume. You are closer to a normie than an artist with your shit opinions. Those ghostwriter tracks are trash and so is your taste.
<comment>
Real question is can ai say the n word :O
<comment>
You can get your own AI now on your computer/server u idiot
<comment>
They still need creativity, it just means the bulk shit will be free. A talented artist will be able to take Ai and with thier skill create a true master piece while normal people will be able to make thier own bubbles. The arts were always a massive risk. Even coding since alot of it can be copy pasted. Education still needs humans and while having web MDgpt will be nice, you still need a doctor to actually work you through what your problems might be since spider bite, scratch, and rash will look the same. If the automated McDonalds start taking off then we can laugh because the only jobs left will be semi skilled labor jobs. Until they start implanting shit in us but I'll be ok as long they give me a cyber dick.
<comment>
I bet you in 10 years AI will be able to do all of that . Keep deluding yourself that humans are somewhat special
<comment>
You really think it will be simple Ai at that point. If it can replace blue collar work and even it's own maintenance then it's at AGI levels to probably artifical human intelligence. Plus it will require some form of robotic shape unless you want city sized factories.

ChatGPT is a glorified autocomplete and has been proven wrong multiple times.
With how worthless your opinion is, AI has already replaced idiots like you.
<comment>
but humans are special. at the end of the day, ai does not have semantic understanding
<comment>
No, you probably have no friends because you type out 'mwahaha' like a 13 yr old on MySpace.
<comment>
keeps trying to spring gochtas
Already saw it plus the robot that slowly puts up drywall. Again skilled labor not retard 3rd world labor. Plus maintenance, and if you want to really go further, assembly, mining, refining, transport, and testing. Again AGI or higher. Anymore cute attempts because I can just go on reddit if this is the level of shit you're gonna bring me.
<comment>
Im autistic 
Keep thinking you are not replaceable . 
Anymore cute attempts
You already made up your mind that you wouldnt change
<comment>
I hope you're an ai because knowing a person is this stupid really is sad. After you clean up the drool on your floor re-read my posts.
<comment>
Keep projecting faggot . We all know ur the retard and I bet u like reddit cause they give u upvotes for ur retarded takes.
<comment>
 you still need a doctor to actually work you through what your problems might be since spider bite
ai doctors could exist. ai is already being used in the healthcare sector and biomedical research. i want a personal ai doctor that tells me what to eat every day
<comment>
And Ai that can do surgery so precisely there is no margin of error as well
<comment>
yeah why not. i wouldnt trust an ai doctor for like a heart transplant. but maybe something smaller like getting something stitched up or lasered off
<comment>
You live at the right time to watch AI destroying the last mental refuge of the wage-drone
B-but I am useful! Society needs me
<comment>
And that's a good thing! The majority of jobs people work these days are completely unnecessary. People are producing nothing of value, it's an economy only made possible by the industrialized production of necessities like food and clothing. My hope is that through the wonders of AI people will realize what is truly important in life and stop laboring futilely for disconnected capitalists.
<comment>
This.
hahaha you fucking loser labourers will be replaced by robotos while I continue making huge bux sitting on my ass
The irony is beautiful. Yes, I am aware that my pay and conditions will get worse because now all these fags will have to work my shit tier jobs too, but I'm just happy to see them miserable
<comment>
Also this. I tried it out. It's like someone took a shit chatbot and glued it to a shit search engine. I don't get the hype for that. The art stuff is cool though
<comment>
AI has a left wing bias. Ask it to say anything "offensive," and it will parrot the usual talking points. If AI does take over those industries, and I'm sure it already has, get ready for 20 more years of sjew basedslop fed to the minds of billions. A lot of media already feels like they've been fed through AI
<comment>
you're braindead if you think an AI can make art
<comment>
Idc about useless politics. Imagine caring about such Benign shit 
What ever makes you happy
<comment>
Neither ai nor modern artists create "art". It will just accelerate the process of flooding the net with useless trash goyslop.
People dont really understand what defines "masterful" and thus impactful artpiece. All normies can comission (from ai) is another trash they will get bored of in a month and forget entirely. 
muh jobs
Its not like digital artists ever had it easy, most of them are just neets earning pennies for noodles.
<comment>
leftist brainwashing 
benign
Pick one
<comment>
seeing normies get replaced by ai is great. how many normies label us incels will lose their jobs kek enjoy being homeless faggots
<comment>
Ur already brainwashed if you keep bringing it up . I hate trannies and fags but u come of as some retarded boomer it you keep saying leftist brainwashing
<comment>
AI can't be any worse than normies, so I'm happy if it takes over the world.
<comment>
I don't like any of the """"creative"""" shit that artists put out. it's always rehashed hero shit with politics and philosophyshit rammed in.
AI will liberate art from the clutches of imaginationless faggot artist gatekeepers and truly enable everyone to create whatever they please.
<comment>
im very glad you appreciate the societal implications of general ai! its always a pleasure to be around people who not only understand it, but get off on it
ive been saying the same thing. i even made my only thread about this subject on lookism psl when it was still active in 2018, but people back then never really cared for it. also i used to make threads about it all the time here too, since 2016, but people were ignorant and didnt care
and you are right! ai is going to automate away ALL jobs. from programming, to art, to police, to doctors, to lawyers. everything that humans are capable of, ai will automate away
this will lead to all men becoming neets. this phenomenon is called "technological automation" and results in people becoming economically irrelevant. only ai will be able to compete in the economy. humans will become irrelevant to the economy in the same way that kangaroos are irrelevant to human economy
and a great amount of smug successful normies will be humbled by this. depression and suicide rates will go up, because statistically people get their joy and purpose from work. and ALL will be useless worthless neets
and its already too late to study for anything. if you enroll in a 4 years computer programming college, by the time you will graduate, your job will be automated. same as doctors and lawyers
cant wait to watch normies and all the pretentious people who looked down on me find out all the hard work for nothing
i too look forward to watching normies get humbled. its a real pleasure, and im thankful to god to experience it :)
<comment>
Op here and im in college and ever since AI has came out ive lost motivation for studying. I legit just use chat gpt for all of it anon . At this moment im only staying for hopes of getting laid and some of the college experience . 
digits and I get laid tomorrow
<comment>
god
You see there? That's how normies will stifle your fantasy. The AI can't be trusted, they'll say. Think of the children. We need oversight, and look we'll all be in the same place again but with AI to "spellcheck" us and a bunch of nannies to spellcheck it, meanwhile the big daddy governments of the world veil it under security on behalf of those who claim ownership over the various learning models and the data that went into them. Nothing will ever free man from the shackles of having to exist amongst others of his kind.
Although it will be a big upset. I'm sure AI will set a new standard and push pseudoprofessionals back into classrooms, or into mcdonalds
<comment>
Some rogue entity or state like North Korea will make it plus when one country starts using it the rest will follow . We might have some resistance but eventually theyll realize how futile it is to stop eventual skynet 
normie seething

Do heterosexual females feel the same kind of disgust when seeing lesbians?
Really seems more like homophobic men than heterosexual men who are entirely secure in their masculinity. The latter might be difficult to, uh, obtain a reasonably sized sample of thoughever
seeing two masculine men kissing is disgusting

Women keep becoming lesbos and then becoming straight again and again. All women are somehow bi but whatever it is,women do seem to be very cuddly and intimate with each other moreso than men are with each other. So. I dont think that kind of lesbo imagery would invoke same reaction in "straight" women.

Paint something related in some way to a previous painting in the thread. It's like the telephone game in paint. How novel!

Standard in every chinese conversation. I'll give you a clue, they are common chinese sentences that are repeated daily.

Now THIS actually captures SOME of my beauty good job 
No but fr anon its great lmao and ye I am polish
<comment>
It was funny at first but if this is actually you, get help. Even if youre just a man who doesnt crossdress but collects gremlin action figures and crossdresses them.
Genuinely uncomfortable
<comment>
Knew it.
That's amazing, great job anon.

Why are you this judgemental now? Just a second ago you were worshiping me with your art skills. Humans truly are two faced.

<comment>
Ha! I knew it was you!
<comment>
Are you the gawk guy?
<comment>
Oh fuck, she's onto me
<comment>
Well thats a relief.
Although I have no idea what I'm going to do with myself when I admit enjoyed your voice, and it turns out you were the catman from before.
<comment>
I WILL gawk gawk you one day. Sleep with one eye open. 
Fuck you catboys are cute, they were made for gremlin mommies 
Gn not at all gay anon
<comment>
If my dreams tonight involve gremlins, I'm blaming you. Night night.
<comment>
Did you ever make it to your desk?
<comment>
This seems like a fun thread but idk what to draw.
<comment>
Draw literally anything or draw a response to one of the other drawings.
<comment>
mkay
here's some knots I drew :D
<comment>
Guess the drawfags left. Sorry anon.
<comment>
bumpicg kewl threade
<comment>
Morning bump, for a good thread.
<comment>
Guess the drawfags left
<comment>
maybe they're still asleep
<comment>
Reverse card. You are now gay again.
OP here. I had a busy day touching grass and fucking ass. When the drawfags go to bed, become the drawfag.
<comment>
maybe they're still asleep
I've done a few.
It's a fun thread.
<comment>
I forgot to say, that's not her giving the bird, she's picking her nose.
<comment>
I think both work just as well
<comment>
Hello anons, water your plants, please and thank you
<comment>

<comment>
Fuck, I missed. That was my last water
<comment>
Dont worry pal, I got you. Drink all you want, refills are free
<comment>
yayy more water :D
<comment>

<comment>
Dont fucking mess with me
<comment>
Its actually straight corn syrup
<comment>
This is stupid and unfunny. I don't know why I did this.
<comment>
I think it's silly, good job :]
<comment>
Had to go to my mums, but I've managed to draw something.
<comment>
All you jews come on here telling me to drink water. Fuck you. I'll have some Irish breakfast tea.
<comment>
very nice thank you for posting
<comment>
guuyysss today's 4 20 we need more weed art
<comment>
Some things are so unfunny that they become funny again. Good job, anon.
<comment>
You can get a netbook bready cheap these days, fren.
<comment>
I'm not bothered about a laptop, I've my PC down home. 
It was an emergency bump, but then realised it wasn't needed.
<comment>
Today is something more significant than that.
<comment>
I'm gonna bump this creative threead
<comment>
It deserves a bump, I'm just not creative enough to really participate. I'm sure other anons think their art is shitty, but it might as well be the Sistine Chapel compared to what I can make.
<comment>
uhhh what a cry baby 
just make something an post it, it's that easy
nobody cares about the quality, just have fun
<comment>
You could draw a stickman.
<comment>
This took me way too long, oh god
<comment>
The first edit I did on mspaint (a picnic basket with 4 things in it), just using the cut tool, took me 3 hours, it should have taken 30 min top. 
Now I can do crap tier images (picrel) in a few mins. 
As long as you're having fun doing it, that's all that matters.
<comment>
very cool thanks for posting ^^
<comment>
keep it up anon.

<comment>
Aww shucks, thanks guys

The image is obviously not meant to be taken seriously, but my advice remains the same. You must treat life like an RPG. What do you do if your character sucks? You improve his stats. Simple as.
When you look good and know how to speak, the world starts to become a more welcoming place. All of a sudden it's easier for you to get a job. All of a sudden you find yourself in a long term relationship with a cutie 3.14. All of a sudden you get invited to take part in a lucrative venture out of the blue. All of sudden people start vouching for you and you influence grows.
This is how one makes it, annon.
Unironically, yes.
Also, "You have been muted for 4 seconds, because your comment was not original.". Why does r9k do that?
I cherish and love my dog wife, and ignore the rest of the world.
why do i even browse this fucking board
Yes, and? It's an effective way of getting want you want out of life.
anon, that isn't what "getting bitches" means...
everyone does so in their own way. you for example go on 4chan and ask other people how they deal with it. some others might smoke weed, or find a religous cultmunity to join. some just kill themselves, but most people just be ignorant of it, worry about making money and finding enjoyable ways of spending the money.
I worked in misery, spent my money traveling. moved to some place with sun and tried making friends, life got better that way.
It is in my book.

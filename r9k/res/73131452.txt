Any robots learn a foreign language? I want to learn le frog but I have failed at language learning numerous times in the past
I've been learning a bit of baguette but I am mostly trlingual as I've learned Filipino, Visayan and english. My advice? Just listen and learn languages in mediums you would've never thought to use. Like putting your discord ui into french or listening to news in the language you're trying to learn. Simplification is also something that shows that you know sufficiently of something at best, tiny bit at worst. Godspeed anon.
American here, I speak French and English. Took 4 years of French, worked as a teachers aide, and lived in France for a year. Still struggled along the way, but got pretty far I terms of fluency. But that was 4 years ago. It's a lot fo studying and repetition and exposing yourself to french media
You have to do a lot of listening and speaking practice, just being able to read is not enough
If you really want to become fluent move to France for a few months and just forcefully immerse yourself while studying, that is really the fastest way
I learned english in school. Lurking and watching series made it nearly fluent then.
Yeah that's the problem for me. I feel like once you know enough to start reading and watching stuff it would be fun to learn. The initial steps to get there is just a slog unfortunately.

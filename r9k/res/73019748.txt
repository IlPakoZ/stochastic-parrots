Anyone here lost it? I was always a nice empathetic person but recently something broke in me. Nothing even happened in particular but I feel only malice and hatred. I want so bad to hurt other people. The only thing on my mind all day is how much I hate people and I want to cause suffering. I'm constantly looking out for any chance at all to do something mean. Even if its little things I am always alert for an opportunity to spread misery. I wasnt like this before it happened almost overnight. It's like a lifetime of bitterness hit all at once. I blame basedciety for this outcome. If I got laid or a girl held my hands or something this probably wouldn't have happened but its too late now. Whatever switch got flipped in me theres no turning back I can tell.
Anyone else ever experienced this? I'm 28ryrs old maybe this is normal?

hurting others wont make you happy tho. 
might give you a temporary little joy but down the line when you ask yourself if you're a good person and the answer is a resounding no you'll suffer.

I'm not a good person I let someone get raped before. When I was a teenager we would walk around a village and smash the windows and destroy stuff for no reason. I have stabbed people who trusted me in the back over and over. I was never a good person, but I was nice to people. But now I dont have any kindness at all only anger and bitterness

I simply feel very little compassion and empathy. The suffering of people I don't have attachment to evokes no emotion

Have you always been like that?

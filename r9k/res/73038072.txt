Why do men pretend to care about me, only to try and get in my pants in the end? I am a human, not breeding stock cattle.
Sex represents a beginning not an end, it is the purest expression of love and the ultimate sign of care. And if you hadn't whored yourself out and considered your own body an object to be used as a worthless tool you would understand this, whore.
Because I need a romantic partner, I don't need anymore friends.
Sex represents a beginning not an end, it is the purest expression of love and the ultimate sign of care.
You have never had sex kek
I am a human, not breeding stock cattle.
You are both
I literally only ever slept with one man, who is my long term boyfriend.
because that's the kind of man you're attracted to, if he were to be genuine and actually cared you'd think he's a loser
y'all bitches are to blame for idolizing players, now deal with it
Project your loveless existence onto somebody else. You only want it to be meaningless so it is easier to obtain for a freak like yourself.
Then why do you keep trying to get all these men to care about you? The love of a long term boyfriend should be enough attention for you.
I am a human
I bet you've never considered once what it means to be a human.

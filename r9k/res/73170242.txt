apart from pusy, what do women provide?
<comment>
Some of the most enjoyable social moments I've ever had in my life were with women. They're human like us and once you learn how to act upon that fact, you'll find most of your interactions with them to be more enjoyable.

Apart from money, what do men provide in a relationship? Hell most of you wont even provide that anymore.

Nothing, you can replace all of it with toys or porn. Kill them all

She can do various necessary household chores her man is too busy to want to do himself.
Unfortunately too many women don't do these things that could add value to her being in a man's life, and so once the new vagina novelty wears off he finds she has nothing much to offer.

Men are usually the ones putting in the most effort in a relationship. Of course, you'll disagree with this, because you'll be biased by the top 5 % of men which are really the only men noticed by women, making it so that they do not have to put in any effort in the relationship.

they're fun to hang out with

Emotional warmth, cozy well decorated home, packing your lunch/making dinner, notes, compliments, someone to take to nice places and be proud to be seen with, being understood and seen by someone who wants to make you happy are some of the amazing things that women can provide.

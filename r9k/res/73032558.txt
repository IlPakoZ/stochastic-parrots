Just fumbled med school
tl;dr
went into a meds class and realized i don't really care for most people's (normalfags)health or well being
did this for a month and a half and now i can't take it anymore
i hate my classmates (90% women and fags),i can't find a single assignature i like and i miss being a NEET.
Im retaking the equivalent of the SAT zogmutts do in my country so i can switch to a chemistry/pharmacology oriented degree ,and working at mcD's so my parents don't kick me out of the house. I'm a 20 yr soon to be 21 yr old kissless incel btw

good luck anon, hope your pharma/chem degree goes well. 21 isn't too old, in the US it averages 6 years for someone to graduate from uni tho what I'm not sure is what you mean by med school? that's a grad thing here meaning you would already have an undergraduate degree to start

I didn't realize I hate healthcare until after I became a nurse. At least it's possible to only work a day or two each week and still make median income. The money and hours are too good to do anything else.

Every university in my country adheres to different grading standards,i scored well in my SAT equivalent,and that's how i managed to qualify for a career in medicine. The university im shooting for has retarded grading standards (avg.of all my grades between 8-12th is 55% of the requirements ) so i'll be needing to score perfect scores on 3 different exams to get into something that won't make me want tear out my eyeballs after a month

most doctors dont. even if they do at some point they learn to stop giving a fuck because the amount of people who end up in your office after fucking their life up is neverending. broken occasionally by people who never had a chance.

Feeling really shitty right now I could use someone to talk to. It could be on here or wherever is most convenient to you. It could be about anything. I just want to chat with someone.
<comment>
What's up. Something bad happened or just the usual?
<comment>
Hey nony
What's your favorite pizza topping?
What you did today?
<comment>
Nothing in particular just tired of feeling numb all the time. Since I have no one else to talk to just thought I come here and see if it helps. How are you doing?
<comment>
is there something wrong with your brain or is there something wrong with your life? that's step 1 to figure out how to feel better, i think
<comment>
Mice are nice but Christ I hate lice. Capice?
<comment>
I'm okay, just my usual day browsing 4chan. I think I can relate I do feel quite numb or apathetic as well. If you have anything you would like to unload or vent, feel free, I'm all ears. You are anonymous after all.
<comment>
Pepperoni is usually my go to topping but I don't eat pizza that much anymore. Also not much to be honest. Just trying to cope the best ways I can, and yourself?
There could be, I seem to act normal in real life in which people don't seem to notice my mood. Maybe I just good at hiding it. Yet if there is something wrong I have no means of knowing as of now.
<comment>
Well no matter what I do I can enjoy life. Nothing seems to make me feel happy, it's mainly just being exhausted and sad. I just don't know what to do anymore. If I go out and try and finding friends or similar shit I don't know if it would make me happy or feel like a waste. At this point in life I don't compare myself to other people so that's not holding myself back it's the feeling of not knowing what to do to achieve something that'll bring joy in my life.

i've worked in the barents sea during hurricanes and i didn't get seasick. 
people who get seasick on cruise ships are fucking faggots.
<comment>
Isn't it hollow having a conversation like this
<comment>
Hey everyone is different. Just because you don't get something others do doesn't mean you should be negative towards them.
<comment>
Well yeah but what else do you suggest for a friendless loner like myself? I am open to suggestions. Because expect for one person here I am not getting anywhere.
<comment>
so if someone cries because they lose their fork or some trivial shit you dont think they're a pussy? same vibe
<comment>
They be more weak minded than most but at worst you should feel pity for them and not an asshole.
<comment>
If I had any suggestions I wouldn't be here. I'm too chickenshit to connect to people online anymore, people are too crazy and too cruel. But having connections in 4chan threads in 2023, its all bullshit, it won't fill the void. Hate talking to normalfags here

I understand, at this point I wonder if I can even feel happiness from communicating with others. Being in the company of another human, perhaps it would always feel like something is wrong. Maybe the desire to fully connect with others is foolish in itself. So far I have been fine with looking inwards to find solace in creative pursuits, alone in my imagination and mind. Many would call it escapism but I believe there is life to be found there. However I do not know if this would be good advice for you, but having a medium to express oneself that one otherwise couldn't through words is liberating.
<comment>
guess i'm biased because i had to pick up the slack from people i worked with who got seasick.
<comment>
Yeah there are too many normal people to have an interesting discussion. Too many people just to gloat or are lying. I'll probably just continue feeling like this until I give up and fully accept it.
Yeah I get what you mean but after awhile I just can't find anything to find peace with but I guess I'll have to deal with it and find something to distract myself for the rest of my life or I'll just rot.
<comment>
you can find out whether there is a problem with your brain or your life. It's simple. Is there anything in life holding you back from your goals? Problem is with your life. Do you not have goals? Problem is with your life. Do you have everything you could reasonably want and yet you still feel numb and bad? Problem is with your brain. It is also possible for it to be a combination of both. My advice: Take up sprinting as a hobby (even just 10 minutes of attempting sprints every other day) and seriously inspect your life. If you find no problems with your life and you get the benefits of sprinting and you STILL feel like shit, it's DEFINITELY a brain thing. Might need to talk to a psychiatrist. If you find problems with your life theeeeeeen fix those. idk. lol.
<comment>
Is there anything in life holding you back from your goals?
I don't have any goals in my life. I am not without but after years of on and off thinking I don't really have anything to go off of.
Problem is with your life. Do you not have goals?
As previously said, nope. 
Problem is with your life. Do you have everything you could reasonably want and yet you still feel numb and bad?
I might not have millions of dollars but at this moment in time I am well off to the point where I am not homeless or sick. There's nothing driving me forward because I have nothing to drive forward too.
Might need to talk to a psychiatrist.
Maybe I do but I have a feeling they won't be that helpful in my case and I don't want to waste money on such things if it isn't going to help, but thanks for the suggestions I might try them soon after I think more.
<comment>
no need man, it's clear as day to me that you're lacking in purpose. you just gotta find something to truly dedicate yourself to, something you love. something that feels like it matters. keep searchin' man. could truely be anything
<comment>
Yeah just trying to find it will be the hard part. I am sure I'll find it one day but I guess I'll take it one day at a time. Thanks for trying though.

Is there anything you can recall in your life that gave you even the slightest interest? It doesn't have to be something grand but recall any memory in which your interest or any sort of fleeting happiness. Sometimes it's the simple things that count, or being able to appreciate and notice simple things. I do think the modern landscape has rewired many people's brains, and so perhaps our idea of happiness is skewed. Finding something to be passionate or a drive is an obvious answer but to search for one is difficult, or rather knowing the possibilities within your reach and scope is the difficult task. I also agree with the other anon maybe you should go seek a psychiatrist.
<comment>
is everything ok big guy? i care about you.
<comment>
I always have been a loner and the only person around just used me as a backup "friend". Other than that I just have been coping with different things through out these years. Some work for a while but they eventually become uninteresting to do. So I really don't have anything to think back to in which I found enjoyment out of. All it was is just another cope after another so I don't go insane. And the more I think about it I don't think a psychiatrist would help since I'll just end up repeating the same things I do here but maybe with a bit more detail and there is nothing to be done unless I do it. It's all me so I have to figure it out myself or face the consequences.
<comment>
Could be worse, could be a lot better. tldr is I have no goals or motivations in life.
<comment>
you don't have to figure it out alone fren
<comment>
find gainz and find God. start lifting and start going to church, and find a church that you can meet people and form relationships at (small groups are great for this). even if you don't believe in God, having a group of people who can help guide you through life is invaluable.
<comment>
At this point I don't see any other way unless I want to pay someone to listen to me and that would make things worse for myself.
<comment>
Don't believe in god and forcing myself to do something like that would not be a good thing to do. I wouldn't find any real purpose if I did that and would accomplish nothing. And I have no energy or motive to lift. I am healthily and not fat so that would just be another chore to me. Thanks for trying though.

you force yourself out of bed every day and think "now we jim" or you drive home from work and think "now we jim" and you do it. my first few weeks I didn't want to do it either but after a few weeks it becomes a habit and eventually you start enjoying it. don't sign on to any contracts, gold's gym is pretty good. or sign on to a contract so you feel forced to go. working out feels great, it gives you all sorts of happy chemicals, and feeling muscular is incredible
<comment>
I tried that in the past when I graduated highschool 10 years ago. Read all things it would do and it can make me happy. Tried it for like a year while losing weight and after losing the weight through diet and working out it didn't make me feel any better. Was obese in highschool and after losing over 100+ lbs I didn't feel any better so I quit working out. Didn't gain any weight back but still feel the same. Sorry should of been more clear
<comment>
Describe your copes. I know I cope with some of my hobbies and interests myself, but learning how to take them farther or change the way I approach them has helped. Like reinventing a mindset maybe, I do not know if that makes much sense. Ultimately it can be argued that everything in life is just a cope, but even so I find that juggling and trying to invent new ways to keep myself busy has helped me somewhat. Sometimes appreciating simple stuff such as the sunset whilst daydreaming or being able to regain a curiosity for small things is important.

Has been video games off and on but as of late I can't even tolerate playing anything. Latest was Old School Runescape but I might replay old Pokemon games now and then but that's rare and newer ones suck ass as of late. Then there is watching YouTube videos but it's becoming hard to find much enjoyment in that when everything is about money over fun so most people I watched in the past are now sell outs. I also use to watch anime but I have already watched the ones I like countless times and can't find interest in new ones. Then it was drinking. Which I thought was the cause of my problem but it after quitting it, it turned out to be a symptom instead. Those were my main copes, I am sure there were others but that's all I can think of now.

i feel this too. i'm not really sure why
<comment>
Big ideas rushed development. Games take longer to make but have to be made yearly in Pokemons case.
<comment>
that's a good point. they should just refurbish the entire pokemon world in general. not that i've kept up in recent years. but i'm pretty sure it's the same schtick
<comment>
It is but with less Pokemon you can get in the game. Unlike older ones in which you can theoretically get them all in one game you can't in the newer ones. So they add more but take more away.
<comment>
one hop this time #0001
<comment>
ahh, true. cutting off the old fanbase i guess
<comment>
Well, i make roblox montages if that helps

I understand you, I feel the same way. Do you know what it is about games that attracted you? Was it for the story, gameplay, or socializing aspect? What about making games if you had an interest in them before? How about wanting to make a game that you would want to play yourself?
Then there is watching YouTube videos but it's becoming hard to find much enjoyment in that when everything is about money over fun so most people I watched in the past are now sell outs.
I get that, sucks how everything is so monetized now. I miss old youtube a lot.
I also use to watch anime but I have already watched the ones I like countless times and can't find interest in new ones. 
I get that too, I still watch the occasional anime when I find a good recommendation but just over-consuming on them is tiring. Is there anything specific about anime that you like, for example what would you think about learning to draw or animate yourself, or perhaps writing stories and characters?
<comment>
 I understand you, I feel the same way. Do you know what it is about games that attracted you? 
I like older ones. Like SMB 1/3 on the Nintendo and SMW on SNES. That and most other mainline mario game I can think of but I played them to death over the years.

I like it if has an interesting story and the art style is nice. My old favorites were Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Death Note, Dragonball/Z. Not the biggest fan of Super. One Punch Man is good need to start reading the Manga since there hasn't been a Season 3. If I feel up to it that is. Creativity has never been my thing. I have ideas in my head but no talent to put into something to meet my standards.
Thanks, seems like something you have some passion for. Good luck if you want to keep on doing it.
<comment>
Getting tired, again. So going to try and sleep if possible. (insomnia and all). Thanks for the talk. It's got me thinking a bit which more than what I expected here. So cudos to you. Take care and don't be like me.
<comment>
It was nice chatting sleep well
<comment>
My physics homework had a hard problem on it so I got mad and gave up for now.

See, there'a something. Anon, it is never too late. I have been drawing my whole life and have seen people who only learned creative skills in adulthood surpass me skill-wise in just several years through dedication and good learning. It is difficult, yes, but very rewarding. If you have an idea then it is better to try than never I say, besides what else could you lose? Even if you don't reach that pinnacle you dream of, the journey there is so satisfying believes me when I say it. I myself am awful with writing stories although I do it in my free time, but I do think it's a great to be able to realize your own ideas on paper. You could also try to find a sort of community or project to collaborate together to create something and take on a managerial or director role.

I'm glad I never acted on my gay urges when I was curious. Its not that gay sex is wrong, but I realized its like smoking cigarettes, indulging or liking it doesn't make you a bad person, buts its risky and adds no tangible value to your life.
<comment>
Damn OP that's crazy you should suck my cock
<comment>
I wish lucid dreaming was real and I could get turned out with no consequences
<comment>
I had a bottom phase in college and honestly I have zero regrets. It's probably the most emotionally fulfilling portion of my life. It's easier to stay on my straight side as a grown man though.
<comment>
Let me guess. The closeted secret gay Chads were fucking you?
<comment>
Not really most of the people I slept with were fully out. I'm just small and white so as soon as I hit the market they were all on me. Sharing and exploring seemed to be completely normal to the LGBT people at the school I went to.
<comment>
Isn't that the same as video games then?
It adds nothing to your life, and it's a huge waste of time and possibly money.
Not saying you should go be a fag though.
<comment>
risky
Yeah, though you could go on PrEP and cast HIV immunity on yourself.
no tangible value
If you're trans or gay and don't indulge in sex or relationships of that sort you might end up not really living your life and feeling bad about it as you age.
Unless you've been slaying puss instead and like that too.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying all my habits are productive, but I'm glad I didn't fill my life with a bunch of shit I don't need.

I tried it once at a bathhouse a few years ago and I was terrified that I might've gotten HIV.
Thankfully I'm clean, but the thought of having AIDS is scary enough to put me off trying it ever again.
And it doesn't help that there's some sick fags out there that try to poz people intentionally with their sick "lovebug" fetish.

I haven't been able to lucid dream, but I know how to give yourself wet dreams. All you have to do is masturbate to whatever porn you'd like to experience in your dream, DON'T ejaculate, take a zinc supplement and go to sleep. Your balls will have stimulated too much production of cum and precum and will have to release it in your sleep, plus I've found that my dreams were often similar to whatever porn I happened to be watching beforehand.

i have gay urges daily, mostly when i wake up and when i go to sleep, but now it's happening when i'm at work and i'm even having gay dreams. it really seems like i've been born gay, since there's nothing in my childhood that would have turned me gay. the only reason why i haven't acted on them is because i'm too afraid, my heart races when i'm confronted with an attractive guy and i just panic
buts its risky
just practice safe sex, make sure you and your partner gets tested with proof, have a good anal cleaning and exercising etiquette, etc. it's just common sense and if they don't want to do it then screw them
and adds no tangible value to your life.
everything is arbitrary OP. the universe, life and consciousness all exist and came to be due to arbitrary reasons. same goes for our gay urges, they came to be due to arbitrary reasons, and we can arbitrarily choose to act out on them or not. everything has value, but it's just arbitrary value, that doesn't mean it's valueless. for example eating food is necessary to keep living, but living and life is arbitrary, therefore eating food is valuable, albeit arbitrarily so.

I'm glad I never acted on my gay urges when I was curious.
me too. it would suck living with hiv or something now that I'm not into crossdressing and all that anymore
<comment>
adds no tangible value to your life
i mean, it was when i was happiest. i was meeting cool people, trying new food, and learning about myself in ways that i couldn't do by myself anymore.
i sure don't miss being curious about something and not acting on it out of fear.
<comment>
and not acting on it out of fear.
how do i prevent this i'm so scared but so interested aaaaaaaaaa
<comment>
be scared and nervous but if they invited you to hang with them, they want to hang with you. just hang and see where it goes. once you're in the moment, you stop being nervous.
<comment>
Dreamlet spotted
<comment>
what if i'm still nervous even when i'm in the moment
<comment>
I can accept it on a purely theoretical level, but if I act on it, the faggot who molested me wins. That's just how I feel.
<comment>
wish I would have been cute
wish I could have been a cock tease getting fucked
wish I could have enjoyed life
Instead all I got was depression and a miserable life
<comment>
I will troon out soon and this position seems lovely. Don't knock it till you tried it.
<comment>
I did. It was alright. 3x. It's not my thing, vomiting the 3x I entertained it told me a lot. Three tranny's on three different occasions.
<comment>
I've never had an interest in anal sex but I've had a cock kink my entire life, I fantasize about sucking dick way more than I do having sex. Eventually I succumbed to the fantasy and met a stranger, while I enjoyed it I hated the fact that he was a stranger, which made it impossible for me to truly enjoy it, also since I'm not attracted to men and just cocks the fact that I didn't know him just made it worse. 
The simple fact that I'm a socially anxious person puts me off doing it again, also the STD thing completely ruins it, I panicked that I might have gotten HIV after I gave the guy a blowjob (I didn't) but the idea of having to even think about the risk puts me off ever doing it again. If I at some point in the future get a straight friend that lets me blow him and I know he's not some slutty faglord that has taken 300 pozzed dicks I would 100% do it, but it'll probably never happen.
I'll never shake the fantasy, I'll jerk off thinking about worshipping cocks till the day I die.
<comment>
That's good for you, but I don't share in feeling that plowing male shit holes is so important that I've missed out on anything. I think when I was curious and open to experiment I was still kinda loss in terms of my values, but once I got that figured out I was able to accept that while I had some gayness in me I didn't need to act on it to be happy, outside of cocklust faps that is.
<comment>
Would you still be saying that if HIV didnt exist
<comment>
idk indulging in gayness and then going back to being straight is hard. I had to stop even thinking about gayness for a year to become straight again.
<comment>
I can relate. I think if you are fully into men it makes more sense to embrace it, but I think the guys like us who are strictly in it for perversion are better off not bothering.
<comment>
JUST FUCKING COMMIT
JUST DO IT
FUCKING DO IT
EVEN IF YOU FUCK IT UP ITS A STORY YOULL LAUGH ABOUT IN 20 YEARS
DO IT FAGGOT
DO IT
<comment>
I mean that I met good people by being open about my sexuality and going to parties and stuff with people I normally wouldn't have hung out with because they were gay. There were nights I was used pretty well and there were nights that it was enough to be open and talk a lot to someone who understood what I was feeling. 
Experience matters sometimes. You're looking back at something you didn't do and thinking that you dodged a bullet but I look back at good and bad experiences and know that I'm a better person because of it.
<comment>
oh shit sorry thought i was in another board
STILL DO IT
D
O
I
T
DO IT NOW
IF YOU REGRET IT IN THE FUTURE, THE EARLIER YOU DO IT NOW, THE SOONER THAT FUTURE IS
YOUR CHOICE IS REGRETTING WHAT YOU DID YESTERDAY
OR REGRETTING WHAT YOU DID 20 YEARS AGO

You could take all the estrogen in the world and you will still never look like this

I hear it will ruin your ass by 30 and you need a diaper 
Asses are exits only
<comment>
really? you ass can shit daily for 80 years and be fine, but a vagina gets 2 or 3 dicks and its looser then a wizards sleeve, but your asshole will fall apart? really now? you can shit cock sized logs your entire life, and its fine, but this is what youve chosen to believe?
<comment>
the cock sized logs you shit don't go back and forth in your ass for minutes straight in a rough manner
<comment>

<comment>

<comment>
You're looking back at something you didn't do and thinking that you dodged a bullet but I look back at good and bad experiences and know that I'm a better person because of it.
Then I think in that case we both may be correct in the paths we took, in the end I'm just as satisfied with my decision as you are.
<comment>
It depends on how extreme you are with it. I saw a cd fag online streaming who started bleeding from his ass because he has internal hemorrhoids that wouldn't go away.
<comment>
you ever had to convince a pysch you were fine and normal? one who had a japanese wife he went crab fishing with, was obessed with the civil war and his office was filled with vegetales figurines?
there are times in your life where shutting the fuck up and doing nothing, truly are dodging bullets.
<comment>
you ever heard of this leek song, anon. they spin leeks around and cute japenese girls dance to it. i talk to some of them, sometimes
...no. i have not.

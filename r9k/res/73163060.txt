It's actual retard tier shit. This isn't like "I feel like my personal opinion is better than your personal opinion," it's "you are saying 1+1 = 6 and I'm saying 1 + 1 = 2."
Women get loads of Tinder matches really easily
Yeah because Tinder has LOADS OF MEN and HARDLY ANY WOMEN, it's not rocket science that the minority has more options in a "pair people up 1:1 contest," whoever is fewest in number in such a contest has more potential pairings.
B-b-but if women aren't on Tinder that proves they're getting loads of matches IRL
Nah wrong again retard some of the shit men pull on dating apps is borderline illegal like sending dick picks. How would you like it if some 800 pound bitch or a gay dude was spamming you with nudes daily? You'd probably as a first step leave the platform where that was happening. Which leads me to...
"Women have the glorious and righteous privilege of being harassed!"
No, a basically mentally healthy person doesn't like getting spammed with porn or getting catcalled. Have you ever had a bunch of dudes drive by in a car and yell "FAGGOT!" at you? Well this is what 90% of womens' oh-so-enviable "options" are: dudes screaming shit from cars.
"But they can get sex SO EASILY!"
Sex is not the same thing for women that it is for men. If a woman is careless enough with sex she gets pregnant. What are the consequences for men? "Oh she'll get a paternity test," she 99% won't, and if she did, you could just move abroad.
"But muh feels."
Now you are finally getting to a point. It does feel bad to not get what you want from the opposite sex, but as my previous points show, women don't get what they want from the opposite sex necessarily. "Easy sex" is not womens' goal, sex is dangerous for women, they want to be valued and loved and just go on the internet any day of the week and see that that's NOT what they're getting LMFAO.

Muh femcels so lonely dating is so hard as a woman

It's like how a picky eater says there's no food at an amusement park because it's unhealthy. Women want an ideal not something practical.

all these options arent chad!

incels are gonna seethe at this post, but I see nothing wrong with it. 
Incels think dating for women is easy because any man will gladly use her as a cock sleeve before throwing her away. 
That actually just makes it harder though. Harder to know who to trust.

Made a tinder account which is literally me wearing a wig, completely shocked at the amount of guys who wanted to bone me even though Im 6'1. So if a lanklet like me with a wig can get that much penis imagine what a bio female could get, stfu foid

seethe sexless moid. I have a cock and a GF
I'm OP and I'm also moid
This only confirms my point lol it's not that "women have it easy" it's that "sex is easy to obtain from men whether you're male or female." If you wanna experience female-tier ease of access to sex just go gay lol.
<comment>
You can't call everyone who doesn't agree with you a roastie hag.
<comment>
Indeed Im lucky as the other way around never happens, if you wanted a date you would find a guy who isnt a manipulative fuck boy but you dont want that at all thats why you ignore the decent guys on tinder and only see the fuck boys because your a subhuman animal who cant control yourself
<comment>
Women do have it easy on another one of my tinder accounts using a Becky I can somehow romance women better as a fucking foid than my regular self meaning a foid is more likely to tongue another foid than a non Chad male thats how mentally ill your sex is
<comment>
I would do anything to have a woman who was even just willing to talk to me and get to know me. Unfortunately since I am unattractive women do not see me as a human. Maybe women should give a chance to all the guys who they look past for not being the most attractive. I know I would do everything I could to be the best bf possible and would dedicate all my time and effort to making her happy.
<comment>
tldr; women have no dating problems
okay problem solved, next thread
<comment>
I have dehumanised men so much that the idea of them desiring me sexually repulses me
<comment>
Waste of time a Chad profile picture that did literally everything your normal self does gets ass 1 millionx easier meaning all the foid cares about is how good you look they dont even register your personality period

I'm not talking about well adjusted dudes hitting on women I'm talking about disgusting street urchins harassing people and P.S. I'm a man so you can cut it with the "WAAAAH WOMEN ARE MEAN TO ME" schtick some people just like to have empathy for both sexes.

Women do have dating problemes but from their possition dating is far easier
<comment>
nah, being socially ostracized and being treated like a piece of shit is objectively worse than being "catcalled", also you fuck the guys who catcall you and slap your ass at the club, I've never shouted shit at women or touched them inappropriately, yet I am a "creep" for trying to talk to a woman under 35, whereas you reward genuine creeps with sex
you are what's wrong with society, not me, you're brainwashed to hate me for no fucking reason, because I don't fit in with popular culture, because I am le toxic masculinity mansplaining bla bla, whatever propaganda has been fed directly into your brain, I haven't done shit, I remember when you people used to say "just talk to women", now not even that is allowed, I have to use tinder which, as you admit, is a sausagefest where there is basically 0 chance
no wonder 60% of young men are single compared to 30% of young women, society is collapsing, I'm done with modern culture and feminists like you, the thing is I agree with feminism in the abstract, you know, treating people as individuals instead of judging them, I get treated like shit because I'm a nerd and have been out of the loop since I was a teenager, I could get behind that, but clearly it isn't working and you people hate me for no reason, so, I'm done, I will get away from modern culture and try to marry a good christian woman or something
<comment>
The only way to explain that image is looks redditors vary so there had to be some decent catches outside of face but all the subhuman foid monkey sees is your fucking face your wealth, your status, your personality, your height, your cock size none of that fucking shit matters ONLY YOUR FUCKING FACE MATTERS
<comment>
broke: incel shit is the product of a fundamentally decent person being sexually frustrated and coming up with ridiculous doom-saying cope and regretfully coming to the conclusion that women just must be bad and shallow
woke: incel shit is the product of a fundamentally misanthropic and negative person projecting their own negativity onto other people, because since that's how they are they assume the entire world is like that
<comment>
Notice how everyone disagreeing with this has to resort to bigotry and childish insults. You are 100% right. 
For men, dating is like trying to find a clean glass of water in the desert. For women, it's like trying to find a clean glass of water in a swamp. We both thirsty
<comment>
don't care roastoid, you shouldn't be on our site, dating problems or not.
<comment>
the people who treat you like a subhuman even though you never did anything to them
actually they are right and you deserve to be mistreated, haha
this is some sadistic gaslighting
Where are all these women who aren't shallow? Every woman I've met is incredibly sarcastic and dismissive and ends up ghosting me, they don't want anything to do with me. You're wrong, completely wrong, and we've seen all the feminist propaganda that depicts us as a threat to be excluded, it is all out in the open, it is not as though you are hiding it. You piss on us and tell us it's raining.

Women's approach to relationships is inherently retarded. You cannot rely on chemistry, first impressions and sex on the first date as the basis for a strong, long lasting relationship, and then rationalize bits in common you learn about each other after the fact as reason you clicked in the first place. It's unsurprising those "wow, that just happened" nights don't turn into anything meaningful and you only stay "friends with benefits".
A guy approaching a girl from the standpoint of taking things slow and dating, isn't sexually interesting enough to create a spark to get with a girl (unless you're attractive enough to cause the tingles but assuming not) and will probably end up being her friend, and nothing more than that ever. The order of operations matters, because if a guy tries to be compatible with a girl in the beginning, her first impression of him will be "friend" and not "potential romantic mate". You cannot expect men to carry the burden of creating every piece of meaning in the relationship, fine tailored to what some non confrontational "shy" girl without any interests or opinions wants. Men that can't find the perfect framework of socially maneuvering a girl not putting any effort in, into having something both exciting and meaningful (and initiating everything) are called "autistic" or "shitty men" or "average or below". Just never good enough.
Yeah women get a lot of people to choose from. You'd think they'd adapt to filter out the people not interested in anything long term, but they actually just choose the chad that's interested in a quick fuck and that's it. It looks like they'd rather die alone and complain about it along the way than actually put effort to get to know someone, get together, and love him more the more information they know about him, instead of getting bored the longer they're together.
<comment>
Negative people have sex though so your entire gaslighting attempt is malarky
<comment>
for one women barely need to use dating apps hence why there's so infrequent on it. two if women have trouble finding relationships just imagine how hard it is for a man to find one. three women obviously enjoy flings and casual sex as well so the idea that they don't benefit from that is wrong. four the idea that they can't find relationships is them being picky or stupid. i'm literally bisexual, average looking, and have gays with much better jobs than mine who are supposedly not committal at all asking me on dates so the idea that women can't attract serious interest is nonsense.
<comment>
Men have huge competition over a small pool of women.
Women have to dig through heaps of trash to actually find a worthy guy, and it's not like you want to waste any time on trash.
So yeah, women do have their own dating problems.
<comment>
No, a basically mentally healthy person doesn't like getting spammed with porn or getting catcalled

Women have to dig through heaps of trash to actually find a worthy guy
No they don't lmao. most men are personalitywise and behaviorwise superior to virtually all women. More dignity, more decency, more compassion, more rationality, etc.
The only thing you could possible mean by "heaps of trash" is genetically short or genetically not facially handsome. Simple as.
Women have endless options at or above them personality and behavior wise because women are far worse people on average compared to men. What they don't have is physical genetic gigachad.

The woman has to search for clean water, but there is no water in the desert. The woman has a chance, the man never had a chance. It is not the same, what is an inconvenience for you is an impossibility for us.

What is your idea of a "worthy guy"?
I can guarantee you there are about a dozen robots on /r9k/ right now who are decent and would never hurt a fly, who shower every day and clean up after themselves, who will put in the effort to be social and try not to be too cringy when you take them to parties or to the club or whatever you want to do. Their lives may not have gone perfectly, they may not have gone to college and be "going places", but are you really going to judge people by wealth? Is that your dealbreaker?
I can also guarantee you will come up with some mundane reason for rejecting them. Like their taste in music or they are "boring" because they don't like your own pop culture interests and you are going to put 0 effort into getting into their interests. You won't ever give them a chance, like most women.
You are not lonely. You are spoiled. You are hateful. You have a head filled with all that "toxic masculinity" stuff created by mass media to get you to hate us. You have been brainwashed by this shitty society in which we now live.
In the past it was different. You would be raised as part of a community, you'd have the same tastes, you'd get along better, you'd probably be married. Apparently 60% of young men are single now compared to 30% of women. birth rates have dropped, everyone is miserable despite being in an era of prosperity. This society is a complete fucking dead end. The sooner you give up on it the better.

Men will always amaze me I love how they bring up things like taking a shower daily and basic hygiene as reasons as to why they deserve a gf lmfaooooo

Foids can't experience empathy, they can merely emulate it for their own children, but that's it. Empathy can only be experienced by (most) men.

If women didn't have a wet pussy between their legs NOBODY would want to be around them.
<comment>
Not him, but usually this is in response to something condescending which autists don't understand. Girls would reduce someone's inability to get a girlfriend to "maybe you should shower and get new clothes then", which is why he mentions this. Most people would recognize it's a below-minimum prerequisite.
<comment>
why do men always say this when this entire site is a shining example as to why that's not true.
prostitution has always existed yet incels still exist because men don't only crave muh wet hole.
men want the emotional intimacy and nurturing aspects that only femininity can provide. that's why there's always daily waaa no gf posts, because it's not just sex, it's everything a genuine relationship with a woman can give you that you can't get from your male friends or from a prostitute.
<comment>
Yes, women have dating problems, but they don't have masculine-form problems with dating. This isn't exactly a neutral and critical space, and naturally, people may not consider all the relevant perspectives. Ultimately, all issues with sexuality arise from the fact that it's very selfish, but not just on the obvious, individual grounds, it's also like that in the sense of male vs female sexuality. You either don't think about it too much or recede from it into various forms of abstinence, anything else is unstable. Posterity, hopefully, will enjoy their ability to reproduce without engaging in such a fundamentally immoral act. Anyway,
B-b-but if women aren't on Tinder that proves they're getting loads of matches IRL
At birth, the ratio is 51-49 percent male-female, so assuming total monogamous pairing, women do have it easier. At least now, when men aren't getting culled already by the time they're in their 20s for one reason or another.
<comment>
you're telling me you've never heard the expression "can't live with them, can't live without them?"
its the wet pussy, get over yourself
<comment>
You literally see women talking about how their tall boyfriends have skidmarks on their underwear or bed sheets or dont wipe because they think its gay and they are still with them. As always if you manage to pass a womans looks threshold they will make excuses and if you dare exist as an average man and try to get an average girlfriend all of a sudden there is every excuse as to why he doesnt deserve her.
<comment>
Oh man, it must suck so bad to have too many options. Being attractive is so hard, I'm sorry. Oh the humanity.
<comment>
What's with the anal retentive nitpicking and overanalysis? I never said it was some kind of dealbreaker. Most people in fact don't even shower every day and as >>73164705 points out there are some nasty ass guys out there with skidmarks who still get a gf.
deserve
You decide what you "deserve", the question here is what you think you deserve. What is your idea of a "worthy guy"?
Of course you're not going to show any honesty, think about what I am saying and reply intelligently. If you told me your idea of a "worthy guy" in more detail it would reveal you aren't really lonely, just have ridiculously high standards, of course. But also you view me as an inferior, this is why you are talking about me in the third person. You hate me that much you can't even talk to me like a normal person.
Literally everything I said in my post is true. You are spoiled. You do hate me even though I haven't done anything to you, only questioned your supposedly perfectly tolerant inclusive society which never tolerated or included me. You are literally just corroborating everything I say.
<comment>
better statistics on the shower thing, most people in fact shower once per day but a good proportion do not
<comment>
I ain't reading the insincere attention whoring rant.
I will say that I have personally seen a ghoul looking burn victim of a woman with a bad personality still have a attractive husband and even more attractive boyfriend on the side. We are talking melted crispy face lacking a nose and ears. 0 out of 10 in attractiveness.
And not only does she have someone to commit to her, but has a boytoy on the side.
What more do I really need to say.
Simply existing as a female means you are spoiled for choice for relationships, commitment, and especially for sexual partners.
It is extremely easy compared to anything men have to go through to even have the remote chance of slight possible positive female attention.jhmpam

I don't care if women have or don't have problems. They deserve to suffer like they made me suffer.

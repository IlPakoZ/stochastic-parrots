How are we supposed to "behave" when there are women walking the street like that everywhere ?
How do we resist the urge to rape ?
How are we expected to remain unfazed when working with women like that ?
These women are doing absolutely everything to light up our sexual desire. The representation of Venus from the old times would be below average right now. They are all sculpted to be the perfect cum dumpster. They are not trying to appeal as good wives anymore, they have exclusively maximized the sex appeal, but the kind of sex that is brutal, animalistic, dirty, not the one to breed. They smell sex, they breath sex, they talk sex, they walk sex, they are SEX. When i see a woman like that i CANNOT think of anything else than sex.

Do what Jesus said. "If a seeing a womans body causes you to sin stab your eyes out if your penis is causing you to sin cut it off if your arms cause you to sin cut them off."

Based Jesus fan. But is it not also said after Eve and Adam ate the forbidden fruit that they felt embarrassed? Is that not a lesson that humans should feel embarrassed about their bodies, and as such, why clothes were made to cover up said bodies? You are right, but OPs implication that she shouldnt be walking around looking like that is also right.

Meh, rape probably doesnt feel as good as consensual sex anyway because of all the struggles, getting injured with her nails, hearing her crying, her being dry etc. Seems annoying and pointless unless you hate women and want to experience a power trip (still kinda lame tho, because you are obviously going to physically overpower her)

I have long super curly hair. Trying to loose my virginity because I'm getting old. What's a haircut that makes foids cum?
<comment>
It's less hairstyle and more how well you take care of it. Just get a typical trendy cut and/or one that suits your face shape. How old are you btw
<comment>
I get a skinhead buzz cut. Girls don't mind it but you need good face bones to pull it off well
<comment>
yeah just dont look scruffy, look trim, make sure your hair feels and smells nice

cut it so it's short enough to be masculine but long enough to get messy and seem a little punk rock

An "incel hair cut" is whatever hair cut appears over your face.
It doesn't matter what hair cut you get if you are incel. You will either look like a chud or like someone overcompensating or culturally appropriating or SOMETHING. You could go out tomorrow and exactly duplicate Chad's haircut to the millimeter and everyone would still tell you that you have an incel hair cut. If you point at Chad, they will shrug and say, "It looks good on him," or "That hair cut suits his face and head type and not yours," or something similar.
This is 1000000x more true if you are white, BTW. If you are white ANY hair cut you get other people will declare to be a chud hair cut.

If you have a foot fetish, you're going to be a virgin for life, nothing will save you short of gigachad status, or paying for it.
Women are creeped the fuck out by those people, but will sell you pics all day long, but wouldn't touch you with a 50ft pole.

whatever it is, just don't let it be overly groomed

i want to do my hair kinda like picrel but im too lazy so i just go with a mama's boy buzzcut every 3 months or so
<comment>
Agreed. I'm white and I've tried everything from buzzcuts to mop tops. Still can't get pussy. Terminally an incel I guess.
<comment>
I mean this is really hot but this pic has like 10 diff haircuts which are you on about ?
<comment>
buzzcuts are gross look unkempt after a week, just google "famous 26 year old male" and pick a haircut. if you style it with some pomade and take care of it regularly you will look nice! good luck anon

I am a value antirealist. In my conception, something is real if it has existence outside of our conception of it. For instance, mount everest is real because it's there whether or not we think about it, whereas Spiderman is not because he only exists in our heads. My position is that moral and aesthetic value are not real. Rather, we call something "good" or "beautiful" only because we feel positive subjective value towards it. What do you all think?
I think it's a failed concept. Things in "reality" only exist when observed, so defining something that's outside our observation is not meaningful
Special relativity showed that to be true. A star explodes 1 light year away from us. To an observer nearby, it has already happened but for us it actually has NOT happened yet. It's not that we haven't seen the reality yet, it's deeper than that. It's that our actual reality is different.
is it?

What would you do?
Me, my mom and my sister her bf live together
My sister always bitches about how she doesn't get enough money from mom, never got a job btw
And how she should be getting all the money mom spends on me, which is 0, i do work and almost not even live here
I actually pay for some of the shit my sister uses like water and Power and stuff and she has a grudge against me for one time I was paranoid and spooked her friends
Now, she bitches about it aaaaaall the time trying to bully my mom into giving her money, and I was thinking
Should i call the cops on her for weed owning and selling?
My mom would hate it, but do you guys think it would help her be at peace ?

With how immature and childish she's sounding prison would undoubtedly fuck her up majorly, and ruin any relationship you have with your mom if she finds out it was you who reported her.
But if you're okay with all that, go for it
<comment>
Hmmm
I would rather not ruin my relationship with mom
But 100% on with fucking her life, i don't care so
Any suggestions ?
<comment>
Really the only issue i have with prison is how easy would it be to get a restraining order so after she leaves she doesn't have anywhere to stay at

I think you should do what's best for your mother, but make sure you got an escape plan in case she kicks you out. Or you could just have your mom not find out, leave an anonymous tip.

Snitch, dealing drugs is the most degenerate shit, and she has 100% chance of getting stabbed by some junkie if she continues
<comment>
Oh she Will know it was me, already talked with her about it
<comment>
I wish, but not likely
<comment>
ctually pay for some of the shit my sister uses like water and Power and stuff
I would simply not do this anymore, and leave them. Leaches need to be cut off, not catered to. Bringing the cops in is never a good idea.

My bitch sister does the same thing 
Fuck it turn her into the cops and play stupid act like she got caught on her own

Ethically I think you should report her, but it's not always that easy. Weigh the pros (getting rid of your sis, mom will be at ease) against the cons (might be kicked out, might ruin your relationship with your mother forever) and so on, and then decide what you wish to do.

I don't really give a shit. Post your mom's panties and dildo collection
<comment>
Lmao you don't get stabbed selling weed you neet retard
<comment>
Why it's not a good idea?
<comment>
dealing drugs is the most degenerate shit
Lmao. What a fucking nerd
<comment>
Why it isn't a good idea nony?

Eh. From my sense of honor, bringing in law enforcements for private matters isn't the way to go. It's like a betrayal of some sort. 
For you, if you think your mom won't turn against you completely and start full-time supporting and enabling your sister's shit behavior as a knee-jerk reaction (my grandma did that for my auntie, supported her for until she died), then go for it.
<comment>
A betrayal?
Betrayal
I don't understand what this means honestly
That knee-jerk reaction is something I do worry about, mom isn't reasonable and she's giving in to the bullying, hmmm
What else could i do?
I don't care about sister at all, should i murder her instead?
<comment>
Yeah i can't think of how to solve this without things getting bad
<comment>
I better understand the situation now. If you can get her arrested for weed I approve. She will lower your mom's lifespan significantly from the stress of being around her.

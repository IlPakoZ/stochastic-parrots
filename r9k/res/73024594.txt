How do I find a gf who's really into pegging? And sph or femdom if I'm lucky.
I don't need a true femdom, just a switch girl who would peg me in-between me fucking her too.
tried this and I must be very unlucky because in my area it was ALL people over age 50. like WTF dude.
if you need your bussy filled, download grindr
Just get a girlfriend and then tell her to peg you.
I've been wondering how to bring it up to my wife. So far it's just rimjobs and fingering but she's jokingly mentioned pegging a few times.
I do not want to have sex with men. I know people think that being into pegging is gay but it literally is different. If I try to get it up for a man it doesn't work. It has to be a woman penetrating me.
Closer, but still different from what I'm into. The dick has to be a strap on.
No woman is truly into femdom sorry. I tried telling my ex about just soft femdom stuff I was into and it changed how she viewed me and ultimately ruined our relationship. Most women who say their into it are just doing so because its trendy right now.
You don't need to get it up.
I'm sorry OP, but it's just luck. 
I practically won the lottery. My very first girlfriend was into everything femdom and had the forsight to lock me in a cage without even taking my virginity first. Haplily together twelve years this month :)
There's a girl I know who may be into me, she's actually physically stronger than me and has wrestled me unprompted multiple times. She seems into me and I wonder if she'd ever peg me.
Being upfront about having a kink would help even with a "normal" girl. All women are natural pleasers so she'll probably try it.
if you want to filter it outright, you need to put it in your bio, because bringing it up early in a first conversation is tough not to scare people away unless you were so hot you didnt have these problems

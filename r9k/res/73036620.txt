Why are so many anons here attracted to trashy girls with neon hair and heavy eyeliner? I thought incels consider all of those things red flags.
Classic mistake assuming all of /r9k/ is one person, 6/10 bait
Because they're the female equivalent of a lot of the males here. Both them and the girls are full of red flags.
Because those women are typically huge sluts.
Those kinds of "red flag" things radiate a passive signal of "available to reproduce", so it triggers the base caveman instinct to reproduce, but that's about it. It's just an instinctual response to a female broadcasting that she's available.
They're considered red flags because those women make fucking awful gfs and wives.
This, trashy girls are easy as fuck, but that's also what makes them terrible lifelong partners. If it's easy to get 'in', then that means you're probably going to have a hell of a time keeping her around, and for less 'reward'.
Because the mental illness makes the pussy that much sweeter.
can't relate to regular women, so we foolishly mistake those retarded women for women that experience real suffering akin to that of a human man's suffering. truth is, they're just stacies, only with added mental illnesses. i'm not depressed, just a bit lonely. they're hopped up on ssris, cannabis, beer, and dick. we're not the same

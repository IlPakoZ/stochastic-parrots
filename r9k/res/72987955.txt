What do my fellow bpd peeps do to get over their depressive phases
<comment>
Not having a mental illness. Shoot yourself in the head you and clean our genepool.
<comment>
are bpd those people who act like total psychopaths and then cry about how no one likes them and how they're unfairly targeted by everyone?
<comment>
You browse r9k and tell people to commit suicide, you don't seem like a very mentally healthy person yourself
<comment>
They are not psychopaths but they tend to have drastic mood swings. You don't know when they will stop loving despite all the extreme love they have shown to you. Creeps like these kinds of women especially because they like the desperation and drama they bring.
<comment>
Destruction of BPDs is for greater good. You will 100 percent agree with me if you ever encounter one. They are one step below Schizos and two steps below psychopaths when it comes to people you don't want to have anywhere in your life.

depressive phases
LMAO what? Mine is unending

Destruction of BPDs is for greater good
Yet the world is filled with toxic npds and nobody bats an eye
<comment>
NPDs can be fixed but BPDs can't
<comment>
Same. I've always been jealous of people who have mental health 'episodes', my depression has been constant since I was 10. BPD symptoms started really showing age 13.
<comment>
TRUE. Even to lesser degrees than a full blown disorder, the biggest faulty of man is the unyielding drive to feed his own ego. Attrocities big and small. 
There's no one shoe fits all so I hope you're not looking for that. If you want advice, you should share things specific to your situation and your triggers.
<comment>
BPD is unbearable, anon. The histrionic, entitled, abusive behavior you associate it with is a product of the way that person already was regardless of their personality disorder. For me it's just constant anguish, like the hopelessness of depression combined with extreme sensitivity. Everything hurts 100x more. I know it's psychosomatic but I feel so bad it manifests as a pain in my chest almost all the time too, plus I'm so scared of abandonment that I can't force myself to trust anyone. You all love to whine about 'le BPDemon' but don't understand most girls with BPD are just suffering quietly.
<comment>
Even psychos kind of suffer but we are talking about greater good here. Ofcourse you feel like shit but your behaviour is born out of BPD that leads to all that coldness. I am blaming the illness not you.
<comment>
You don't understand that BPD manifests so differently in different people. You hear about the abusive and attention seeking cases because they're horrible people who do horrible things loudly and publicly. I've never told anyone I know I have BPD because of the stigma, and you probably wouldn't be able to tell. I'm very avoidant and quiet generally and I don't 'split' the way it's portrayed in the media. Very rarely do people with BPD suddenly start hating someone and ruin their lives. There are a lot of different subtypes, picrel. You hear a lot about the petulant types because of the nature of their actions.
<comment>
I know a BPD guy and all the types have one thing in thats they shouldnt be trusted with their own lives let alone others.
<comment>
What are the differences between quiet bpd and petulant?
If you're the quiet subtype, have you ever unleashed your anger in some way towards your fp?
<comment>
How do I get a BPD boyfriend? I'm {spoilers} gay {/spoilers}.
<comment>
Most faggots have female brains so they are very likely to have BPD. Just go out there and fish nigga. Good luck dealing with all that mental illness though.
<comment>
I don't have FP the same way a lot of other borderlines do because I also have comorbid AvPD. My symptoms are less relationship-oriented and more internal. Subtypes aren't strictly exclusive either, I'm between discouraged and self-destructive. The most stereotypical 'lashing out' BPD thing I've ever done was try to kill myself after my mother told me to just to spite her. She also has BPD and is the cause of mine, she's an abusive bitch whose mental illness exacerbated her existing lack of empathy and narcissism. The combination most inclined to be abusive and reactive is petulant-impulsive. "Quiet BPD" doesn't *really* exist, it's kind of a buzzword at the moment but it's just a way their symptoms manifest rather than a subtype on the spectrum.

Schizos
Fuck off, we're agreeable company.
All my acquaintances enjoy my presence.
<comment>
All my acquaintances enjoy my presence.
Don't take meds anon. You will lose their company.
<comment>
I don't take meds, only went to a psy for the first time last year and i'm 28.
Good joke though, but I have a lots of friend IRL. People either hate me or like me, there's no in-between.
<comment>
I don't take meds
Good anon. They reduce your resistance to microwave attacks and makes all your from disappear.
<comment>
I have encountered several and they've all been fine, just a little moody.
<comment>
Are you courting death right now, pal?
<comment>
You probably have encountered many Psychos too. How important are the BPDs you encountered to your life? I shudder to think someone having a BPD mother.
<comment>
Have you tried just NOT having bpd? You dumbass it's that simple.
<comment>
NPDs can be fixed but BPDs can't
Stop making shit up
<comment>
I will not stop making shit up.
<comment>
I-i apologise anon. It was just a joke haha..
NPD's don't have anything wrong with their brains. They are made not born.
<comment>
I-i apologise anon. It was just a joke haha..
It's alright anon, there's no need for us to be upset.
Are you OP btw?
<comment>
Nope I am the guy who advocated for BPD annihilation.
<comment>
relationships, friends, family. so far.
nah, they're just more emotional. otherwise fine. the key thing is if they're abusing substances or not.
<comment>
NPD has one of the strongest genetic components of all personality disorders.
They are not any less born than other PDs. This is simply what the available evidence and literature says.
<comment>
It's not something you will see me resist there pal
<comment>
I assumed quiet bpd was just discouraged bpd subtype as per your chart.
Subtypes aren't strictly exclusive either, I'm between discouraged and self-destructive. 
Interesting, yes someone I know mostly fits the discouraged subtype (mostly bottles up the anger) but also starts yelling/screaming for several hours -- or sending essay length text messages if she feels momentarily slighted a few days earlier. I assume that fits under the petulant subtype.
<comment>
Screaming for hours? Sounds like my mother. People shouldn't ever let someone manipulate them into dealing with that kind of thing. Abuse is abuse regardless of the abuser's mental illness. Although I try to advocate against it, I can understand why BPD has such a bad reputation. I'm just trying to stop the generalizations a little
<comment>
my ex simply ignored being depressed and convinced herself it was all in her head, and therefore not real and became happy when being with her fp
so just do that
<comment>
when i feel depressive my bf cuddles and pampers me and lets me cry into his chest while patting my head
when i feel obsessive i rub and ride and kiss and lick him for hours and tell him how much i love him a thousand times and it feels so good to spend my excessive energy on him
when i feel angry and violent i rant about other people and subjects to him, never about him since he's a perfect angel~
god i love my bf!
<comment>
God that pic is so relatable it hurts
<comment>
I'm always numb and emotionless but I've been dissociating like hell recently
<comment>
The fact it is you saying that first part is a level of irony I just cannot believe is not on purpose
<comment>
tell me about yourself. 
Do I need to cut again?
<comment>
How often do you hump him and swallow his cum and piss? does he rape you every day
<comment>
By all means tell me what I do that's arrogant. Otherwise you aren't saying anything at all.
<comment>
No point. You are never wrong.
<comment>
you can't rape the willing, i hump him whenever we meet and i'd swallow his everything if he wanted
<comment>
If I'm BPD and don't cut am I a fake BPD?
<comment>
How can I be wrong in the company of someone as emotional as you. You will no longer wasting my time with weightless insults and contradictions.
<comment>
Everyone is emotional to you. See, you said it.

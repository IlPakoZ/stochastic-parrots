I am fucking a young trap who told me he smoked amphetamine(I believe that's how its called) the other day called me afraid she was afraid of everything since the day he did that and told me he has adhd all his life. Seems like that "disorder" is popular with kids nowadays.

I don't know the effects of amphetamine on ADHD, I've been told by many that it can calm people down and helps them focus, unlike your gay friend who had a bad reaction to it, Some stimulants have the opposite effect on me, alcohol makes me hyper and coffee after the first few slows me down, my boss at work always has a coffee break, he's old, so I just load up on free stuff until i'm calm

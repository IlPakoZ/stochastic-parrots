Maybe you have autism 
Maybe you went socialised enouth as a kid
I cant know because i dont know you

What can we really do... We missed out in core steps in our development and now its too late. We are never gonna experience the joy others experimented, and the lessons learnt from that.
Its over

What have you tried to do to make friends? Or do you mean in the sense that it should just happen naturally? idk you can make friends pretty easily just here but you have to tell us or are you just screaming into the void
<comment>
Do you even want friends? I dont want them
<comment>
Simply accept the fact that you will never have a regular life. You will never have lots of friends, and you will never have a girlfriend. After you accept it and recognise that there is literally nothing you can do about it you'll feel a lot better. Then just focus on other things.

you're never going to be a fun extroverted social butterfly, if that's what you mean. but you can learn enough social skills so that most people you meet are neutral or civil towards you and you'll be able to make a few friends over the years if you try

literally replacing it with a substitute lower quality experience
What I wanted is in the past. I dont want any substitutes of half baked shit with people whom I dont give a fuck about nor do I relate to.

thats really brutal anon, i doubt that you can go from hikikomori robot to complete chad/extrovert, but i think theres room for improvement, there are ofcourse exceptions like if you're a burn victim or have EXTREME autism, but i dont think its over yet, the problem is the "how", how do i go from introvert to normie-ish?

then take the advice you would give to a blind man miserable that he cannot see, to wit kill thyself

No. I like drugs, they are enough for me. As a living being, I m programmed to fear death and do anything to maintain my survival, so willingly wanting to kill myself is something I fear and cant bring myself to do.
<comment>
oh sweet what kind of drugs do you do. is it amphetamine type stuff that gives you the confidence and will to interact in society or psychedelics that make you perceive more important things
<comment>
Boring SSRIs. They keep my mood in check, I feel miserable all the time, but I dont suffer physical pain anymore and thats all I wanted. Only pain left is my lower back but for that I take Tramadol. I dont cry that often anymore so thats good enough.

I dunno man. I think adapting to problems is easier than fixing them.
<comment>
wtf man that's not drugs that's just medicine. i thought you were cool
<comment>
Drugs are chemicals, might as well call them chemicals to suit your faggy ass.
Doing drugs to be cool is retarded. I just want to stop the pain. My whole life revolves around minimizing as much as possible pain. Pain is retarded and not suitable for mentally challenged people like me.
<comment>
It's the jews. You should go kill lots of them
<comment>
fails to pick up on obvious joke with obvious rejoinder "what made you think i was cool" which i set up very nicely for you so we could have some fun banter
whoa you're even more autistic than me
<comment>
I m not your friend. Sorry if I hurt your little cunt feelings.
<comment>
my feelings are intact, unlike yours. i am very sorry for you and i hope you feel better sweet pea &lt;3

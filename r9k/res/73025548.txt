I've been obsessed with playing this recently. I don't know how to add onto parts of music in a way that sounds good to me, so it's just another short thing I'll forget in a week

Love that song, anon. Good cover
Damn, sounds really cool, man. And yeah I have the same issue. I always seem to come up with short bits of stuff that sounds cool but I can never turn it into anything. I really don't think I have much talent when it comes to music but I will still keep trying to grind away until I finally get good.
tfw cant play any instruments or sing
Maybe you should make music with samples in a DAW instead. You don't need to invest a single cent to do it

Damn, this thread made me realize I really gotta practice some more.
No one can do that without proper practice or happening to be in the top 1% of insanely talented people
oh hey anon what are you doing here? i was expecting chad, not you. playing instruments or sing is for chad and not anon.
what do?
damn you guys sound great, feed us more.
dont fall the the "cant learn as an adult" bullshit. you can take leasons or just learn the chords of piano, guitar or uke in a few months. if you really feel like you wanna learn go on, its actually very helpful for mental health too
Is original stuff cool or is this a cover-only affair?
"as long as is music in a vocaroo everything is permitted"
i didnt specify the rules this time but yeah, original stuff is cool of course. everything as long as it's music, could be even comedic or whatever. literally anything musical in a vocaroo
but yeah, original stuff is cool of course. everything as long as it's music,
Alrighty then. Here's a demo/song idea thing.

I want to make meaningful online friendships. How do I go about doing this? Share some online friend stories that you have.

I think meaningful online friendships happen when you find someone who clicks with you and you can become honest with them and tell them anything. Online friendships are also more meaningful when you have things to do together, like playing a game. Idk there's probably some papers that you can read on this.
What are you like, anon? Are you shy? What kind of hobbies do you have? Do you play multiplayer games?

literally the only online friends (or friends in general) I've ever had all came from the same small forum community I was part of as a kid. I have never been able to forge any sort of meaningful friendship with someone who wasn't part of that community to some extent.

Same - but we sort of picked up others along the way through gaming together and such like.

I am not particularly shy, I like maths (omw in becoming a mathematician infact), I like philosophy and CS as well. I play games, but mostly single player. I also read random biology/history time to time, but that's about it.
Also fuck I keep on getting the captcha wrong today, that's why I took so long to reply

You sound cute and chill anon, it would probably be comfy to hang out with you. I hope you find some online friends!

Thanks :D
Can I send you a friend req?
I have had friends who have had meaningful online friendships of many years. It's definitely possible.

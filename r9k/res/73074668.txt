There is something REALLY fucking cringe about identifying with Incel or blackpill culture past 21. Agree?
<comment>
Its cringe before 21 even, so yes.

Identifying with any culture is cringe.

Agree?
Not really. That's within the normal age to be idealistic, and swept into whatever ideology suits you (whether or not it's healthy).
You'll notice that a lot of political activists (doesn't matter which) tend to be around the same age.

I was born 91 and wasn't 25 until i knew that looks mattered and that people were judging based on it.
It toke me that long to see it because of some autistic traits and also because I'm above average in attractiveness and have been blind to that fact my whole life up to that point.
Imagine if I was even more good looking, like a model. How oblivious to all of this would I have been then?
Probably really unaware since my life would litteraly have taken other directions based on my facial features alone and being even taller than I am now.
You cannot put a male super model in drags and put him on a street to act homeless without him ending up I'm the arms of others helping him.
If I had those 9+/10 looks and being 6'4 tall I would dedicate my life to hiding whatever cash I have somewhere and moving to a new town and just bring some old cloths. Go out in the streets and beg for some money, tell people I'm homeless or have a sign or something and just watch Joe quickly I would be back on my feet again.
I would then proceed to hide whatever cash I got again, leave whatever occupation I got from the kinds strangers that wanted to help me and start over again in another town while documenting it all.
I bive if someone did this and let it go viral, not in a clickbaity video but in a sincere documentary style with his own camera paperwork and witnesses then the blackpill wouldn't be that niche anymore.

No incel thinks being an incel is fucking cool. That's not the point you blithering retards

yeah. my blackpill/edgelord phase ended when I was 19. now it makes me uncomfortable when I hear people get vocal in support of such things (am 22)

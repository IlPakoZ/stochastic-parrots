Any likeable, attractive robots? I am pretty handsome IMO, funny, and likeable by all accounts. All my friends, including some females ask me why I am single. For me, it is because I am 15 pounds overweight and hate how I look but am addicted to food. 
Basically I am wondering if there are robots that aren't completely doom and gloom and how you are maneuvering life I do feel like I am autistic and can identify with r9k doomers, but at the same time I can objectively recognize that I have the tools to make a good life for myself but don't know how to proceed.

i used to be attractive and have too many friends to count, now I'm just too lazy to care and cannot relate with any of these autists. I'm just to here because I'm bored. And being attractive is literally a cheat btw, I wasn't funny in the slightest and yet cool stuff happened to me everyday

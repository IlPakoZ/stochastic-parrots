Turned 30 this year
Still a virgin
Never had a gf
No status
No wealth
No career
It just.. never gets any better, guys. Now I am worried. Even if I could find a girl who likes me.. what am I gonna find? Single mother with someone elses kid? Obese girls? STDs?Wtf.. I stopped visiting here in 2018 to try and focus and excel. It did not work. Now I am 30 and a complete loser. Plus, all the girls I do meet, wether at work or whatever, are all completely run through and have like ten or more exes and shit. This one girl said she thought I was cute and started talking to me last year and I found out, not only was she talking to four guys at the same time, she has 16 exes.. she is 29. All the girls in my age group on tinder and shit like that are different too. Honestly, it is weird af. You know all these girls were dating and fucking guys all over the place, but when I talk and flirt with them, they get interested, but want like full relationships and multiple dates before you even make out.. Wtf am I supposed to do..
Sorry I am honestly sad and just wanted to rant and this is the only place I know of that would understand this shit.

You're a 30 year old nobody bum why are you so uppity
<comment>
I don't have a response for you. They all had fun and fucked on the first date when they were young but now realized they should withhold sex to test the simps.
<comment>
A 30 year old bum deserves more respect than a blown out roastie, especially if hes not lying about trying to improve
<comment>
why are you so uppity
That's just the way vulnerable narcissists are
<comment>
Because I foolishly believed, after having it rammed down my throat for my entire adolescence, that status and money did not matter. That you can be appreciated and loved, even if you are just an average shmuck with a normal job, and a normal life. Turns out it is all fucking lies to make sure we have enough population of plain workers to support singular billionaires and their children, who are essentially American royalty.
<comment>
if hes not lying
Lmao
<comment>
Why is he flirting with the "blown out roasties" then?
Sounds like OP is mad they want relationships and won't just be his personal whores with no strings attached. He thinks they have no right to want a relationship. He is u-p-p-i-t-y
<comment>
I had that realization when I was 17 and I started going out more and meeting girls. It gets a lot better.
<comment>
Ten years or more of sucking and fucking any frat bro at a party and I am uppity because I do not want to take a girl out for three to four dates before we can even chill and make out.. I never even mentioned having sex with them, you added that lol
<comment>
If the end goal is being together forever what is 3 or 4 dates to start making out...?
<comment>
They dont have a right to want a relationship. Once you diminish your given value for pure hedonistic values you should not complain that no one wants to seriously date you. This goes for men as well. If you are a whore then be prepared to be treated as a whore. If you are a doormat then be prepared to be treated like a doormat.
<comment>
I'm about the same age as you anon. You gotta accept that it's simply over. Even if you were to meet someone at this point you're too far behind. They've been with multiple partners, they've had every kind of sexual experience. They've live with their partner for extended periods of time. Done everything. Nothing is novel for them. 
If you make it this far just accept that its over.
<comment>
Try to whorezone all you want if they want a relationship you aren't getting any nooky
<comment>
Because I am a realist and not delusional so I understand that physical compatibility is a major component of any long term relationship. Period. Only older women say it is not, and that is because they are trying to manipulate. If we are not even compatible enough to kiss and make out, wtf kind of nightmare awaits during sex? Lack of physical attraction and compatibility does matter, no matter what fat pride or any other movement wants you to believe. If you do not have sexual chemistry, especially at a base level, you are for sure not going to last OR you will be cheated on constantly.
<comment>
You are too impatient and horny for love. Maybe a blowup doll would be more your speed
<comment>
OP have you considered dating early 20s women?
<comment>
Lmao. No matter how reasonable and logical my response was, you were going to say some variation of that. You can admit I am right bro. I am not gonna make fun of you. Also, I am 30 and consider myself pretty romantic. But I am not spending my time, energy, and money on taking a girl for multiple dates when it is statistically likely she will cheat on me based on having too many past partners, and based on her promiscuity in the past. I think you think I am dumber than I am desu.
<comment>
Im not like op, im young and in college so I get to vaguely witness zoomer women be the worst generation of women yet. If I actually ever get close to a girl despite my autism I for sure am going to hold both personal and sexual compatibility in equal regard. I know well enough that if she doesnt want my dick within a month of starting the relationship then Im going to get cheated on.
<comment>
Yeah, but idk wtf to do desu. I work in a factory so we do not really have girls like that around. Mostly older women, like 40 plus who work in the offices and HR and stuff. I tried going to clubs and stuff for a little while, but I gotta be honest, I would get completely ignored in them haha. I mean girls would talk to me, but then I would like buy them a drink or a shot or something and they would disappear as soon as I looked away. So that sucks so I stopped going. It sounds fucking cringe but I think there is too much competition in places like that. You see a lot of really good looking dudes with their groups of buddies and stuff. No shade or whatever, it just means I do not even get looked at. The kind of girls who like me tend not to go to clubs haha. Not that the girls who do go are not hot, they just are not interested in me.
<comment>
I don't even think its worth trying. Early 20s girls know their "worth" nowadays and they would never consider settling unless youre really rich.
Maybe import from or move to a third world country. Sad thats the only option we have

<comment>
My bf and I waited almost 3 months to have sex and we've been together almost a decade. Why are other men so impatient?
<comment>
just get an exitbag its fucking over
your problem isn't even looks
you're just a mentalcel and were fucked long before you even knew the game and how to play it
therapy won't do shit, its not designed for you
unironically your options are cope alone and be miserable til you die or leave on your own terms
<comment>
At the end of the day you are just butthurt they won't give it up as fast as you'd like because you think they are whores and have no right to have boundaries. Work on your insecurity, you fugly unlovable freak
<comment>
Because if you arent larping and havent cheated then you are a tiny minority. Even 10 years ago was better for dating than today. If a women is not viscerally attracted to you and wanting to hop on your dick within a short enough time, then as a non chad you have to admit that the attraction is just not there. Many young women are fucking the same top percentile man for hookups or on the first date, there are twice as many single men than women. Its literally just alpha fucks beta bux. If she fucks someone the first day she meets them and then makes me wait, thats just telling on herself that shes a monkey brancher. I should just dump her ass and find someone who find me attractive enough both sexually and personally. Although that will never happen because im a depressed autist.
<comment>
Boundaries? You make it sound like I am trying to rape them ffs. Look, if it take multiple dates for a girl to even want to kiss you, there is no fucking way she is physically attracted to you. Maybe she IS attracted to something about you, but it is not physical. Ignoring a lack of physical attraction in a potential partner is one way to guarantee you waste both of the parties time. They will cheat on you, or the relationship will die out. That goes for me too, bro. I do my best not to lead on any girls who I am not physically attracted to for this exact reason. Save us both the trouble. It is not about me thinking they are white and should want to get naked instantly, I NEVER EVEN MADE IT ABOUT SEX, YOU DID. I have been talking about kissing, dude. Just kissing. There is no way you can tell me someone could be physically attracted to someone else, go on multiple dates, and not even kiss. No way, bro.

Omg, thank you! Shit.
Nice dubs.

Turned 30 this year
Still a virgin
Oh, anon, don't you know April is "male virgin awareness month"! This is a time for everyone to learn about the unique perspectives of male virgins and how the issues they face intersect with social norms stacked against them.
Heh, actually, it's not. It's truly over for you.
<comment>
You are the betabux, that's why they set up all those hoops to fuck.
<comment>
Picrel. Relevant to thread. Physical attraction is a key component to any relationship and there is no way around it.
<comment>
How to counter this?
<comment>
Kissing isn't making out you know that you're just trying to cover for you being pissy they won't be your whore on the 4th date because you look down on them for their pasts and think they should just do whatever you say and move at your pace only. You lack empathy
You're retarded
<comment>
Take one to know one you troglodytic faggot, are you a women or just a simp?
<comment>
There is no counter, you don't just become Chad at 30. Your options aren't be Chad, be betabux, or be alone. They are be betabux or be alone. 
You have to be realistic about what you bring to the table. If you can't make her pussy twitch, then why would she be with you if not for financial stability?
<comment>
you lack empathy
refuses to consider my position
ffs
<comment>
So then, which is worse realistically? So disappointing. Shits fucked.

I don't think older women 30+) are taking it slowly. If they like you, you can have sex after few datas or even on first, if you get drunk or party.

Why do male Redditors pretend to be women and cuckpost? Lmfao clown world my guy

So you were 24 or 25 when you left this place? You were doomed from the start. Enjoy being betabux.

You vill not breed and cause more suffrage. 
Seriously though what is wrong with single mothers?
<comment>
Lots of women are like you, but they aren't attractive either. Recent studies show that women aren't having sex. If every girl you pursued has had multiple parenters in the past, then you pursued women out of your league. I'm close to 24 and I'm an ugly female virgin with low-paying job (teacher), and most of my friends also don't have much experience, because guess what, we are all ugly and poor.
<comment>

Is this really the case with teachers where you are?
Over here (Toronto, Canada) teachers are well paid and massive sloots. Even librarians are massive sloots bragging about their boyfriends having 6-packs.
<comment>
many of the opinions in this thread resonate with me as a failed normie and motivate me to blogpost. i will be 28yo this year, virgin but had a gf which i at least kissed at 15yo. love at first sight is a meme and the women that have interested me over time, not just sexually but as partners, were never single so i am just casually coasting to wizardhood. Im insecure as fuck and have the neverending beta mindset of thinking things will eventually fix themselves on their own for me. now just recently my buddy forced me into meeting his gfs best friend in a no strings attached board game evening trying to pull a girl for me. still not certain if she knew that she was being set up but she had the sweatiest hands when i introduced myself. she ticks all the boxes, early 20yo, modest to potentially virgin (her friend does not know of any past bfs), homebody, introvert-ish, likes to read and bake, smart, tall, slim, kind, far from bad looking and i have somehow managed to keep my spaghetti in my pockets.
Yet even with this once in a lifetime opportunity and all the odds stacked in my favor, I have no motivation to make any moves. its a scenario you could not wish for. when do you ever meet a female virgin of age with probably the same insecurities? and i still have no intention to follow up on it or any idea what the fuck i should even do at this point, so i am back at trying to forget it even happened. she wants to repeat the evening though but how tf do you go about finessing a girl while playing fucking monopoly
im so clueless it hurts
<comment>
what is wrong with single mothers?
I'd rather go ER before raising chads child.
<comment>
Ofc teachers in Canada are getting paid liveable wage, but that's certainly not the case here. I got a small apartment from my parents and that's the only reason I can afford to live by myself, otherwise I'd need to have like 3 roommates to afford rent in my area.
<comment>
It's too late to fix your life now, accept it or kill yourself. I will make sure to not end up like you.
<comment>
Over here (Toronto, Canada) teachers are well paid
This kills me because the education system here is complete garbage. Female teachers are glorified baby sitters and do not deserve the salary they receive from my fucking tax money. I fucking hate this country so much its unreal.
<comment>
I have noticed a lot of women now are very overweight and don't seem to care anymore, like they just gave up completely on trying to stay in shape, especially if they weren't conventionally attractive to start with. I don't think I've seen a woman in years who was thin and not super attractive. It's a shame, because even non conventionally attractive women can look good if they are healthy and take care of themselves.
<comment>
Damn maybe I'll move to Canada then, 93k a year is insane. The article even says teachers aren't being hired anymore, whereas we have severe shortage and I constantly have to do extra hours because of it. I get paid as much as fast food worker I think, I made more money in college working in a hotel than I do now working full time as a teacher.
<comment>
Don't let this opportunity go to waste or you will regret it for years, I know this from experience. Honestly don't try to be subtle, you're a sperg who posts here, you'll fuck up if you try to be subtle. Spend some time talking to her then just straight up ask her out. It'll make you look somewhat confident, and will avoid misunderstandings
<comment>
I wasn't talking about overweight women specifically, but rather just ugly frumpy girls. I'm not fat and my friends aren't fat, you can't really afford being overweight when you are forced to rely only on yourself and are poor. I think you are definitely a little dishonest here anon, I see plenty of unattractive non-overweight girls every day. Maybe you just don't notice them, men tend to not register ugly women.
<comment>
I hope you're not actually playing monopoly on a board game night anon

I know. I worked as a physics/math tutor part-time for a while. I was the best tutor they had. The average teacher in Canada is awful at their jobs.
93k a year
Just to keep in mind that's not USD, It's leafbucks so that's around 70k. It's still really decent though.
It's higher than say a typical Software Engineer salary in Canada. There are some caveats. It's not easy to land those jobs. You will have to work as a supply teacher for a few years before you land a full-time role. You will need an OCT and a bachelor's/master's in education. This is a waste of time and money but it's a hoop you have to jump through. I doubt they learn anything useful there. For example here's the youtube channel of our top ranked Teacher's College.

I don't care how much they get paid, I wouldn't be able to sit through that for 2 years.

<comment>
I would have noticed them since I am not attracted to overweight women and I'm specifically looking for less conventionally attractive women because I am not very handsome. Maybe this is more of a regional thing. I live in Texas and about half the people around me are morbidly obese, and most of the rest are fat. I am one of the few somewhat fit people I know. I know this is an extreme long shot, but if you or one of your friends might be interested in a 26 year old guy with a good career then I can drop a contact. I'm not great looking, but I'm tall and reasonably fit, and I'm good at talking. I would absolutely be interested in a frumpy looking teacher. I am hispanic if that's a problem, but I only speak english and am basically white except in appearance.
<comment>
I'm from EU, sorry anon.
<comment>
Worth a try. Good luck anonette
<comment>
in my eyes you are a failure because you are 30 (same age as me) and have no career or status.
the other shit could all be knocked out in a week or less but having no career is a problem.
<comment>
I know. I worked as a physics/math tutor part-time for a while. I was the best tutor they had. The average teacher in Canada is awful at their jobs.
The average teacher is awful at their jobs because the district handcuffs them at every turn.
Student misbehaving, you can't send him to the principle unless he's white
Instead of studying the material you are forced into making every lesson about race
Can't give students failing grades
Straight A student gets an A-, be prepared for 10 phone calls from parent, a parent teacher conference and a dressing down from the principal
There are several other issues that I could bring up, but these are just what my sister told me from working as a high school teacher. There are no incentives to work hard, or show up more than the minimum required shifts which leads teachers to call out constantly at the end of the year to burn their personal time.
<comment>
A few girls did this to me and I simply assumed that they don't want me so I stopped calling.
<comment>
Incels obsess over looks and think its the only thing that matters, just like you're doing, incel. 
The reality is women don't give a shit about looks aslong as you're not quasimodo ugly.

<comment>
No and while its far from my favorite past time, whats wrong with Monopoly?
you're a sperg who posts here
Lurking /b/ since boxxy era might not be the root of the problem but it sure is a telltale sign. I am good at being polite, safe and distant in social Interactions but with underlying sexual tension I break.
just straight up ask her out
Thats the hardest part though. In group settings i hold group conversations. Its a safe space to put yourself out there. You can talk to people without actually having to really talk to people, so I love that part. Its easy, but doesnt get you anywhere. Catch vibes, but you dont actually get to know a persons life while playing games.
How do you single out a person in that type of setting? I dont even do it with my friends. I think its rude to exclude others. So what I am left with is basically asking for her number out of the blue. At best, when saying goodbye. At worst right at the fucking table. Just thinking of taking the L in front of my friend and his gf while awkwardly trying to ask her out and bombing the mood makes me cringe so hard.
On the other hand, waiting for her to say anon knock me up is surely a fruitless excercise.
But you are right, down the line I would fucking kill myself thinking about the opportunity. You can lead a horse to water, but you cant make it drink and i got my mouth sewn shut apparently
<comment>
you are a failure because you didnt suck corporate jew dick as hard as me
I'm going to be loling hard when you faggots get laid off in mass and become homeless the moment the nu depression hits.
<comment>
before you even knew the game and how to play it
not op but what game?
<comment>
How do you single out a person in that type of setting?
Start by talking to her a bit more than the others as your playing games. The other people there including your friend who set this up will totally understand, so don't feel bad about that. Make eye contact with her and smile a few times, but keep it casual until the end, then when things are winding down pull her aside and tell her you like her, and ask for her number
<comment>
Im 6'4 200 pounds, look like a swarthier skinny triple h. This shit is impossible if youre broke and stuck at a dead end fedex job at 30 in a new city, people dont give you the time of day. People smile and say hi but no one wants to hang out.
<comment>
you ask her if she would be ok with you calling her on the phone to talk. this gives her an out if she's not feeling it. she gives you her phone number. at a later date you call her and ask her about her day. proceed from there to other topics. it's nowhere near as difficult as you make it out to be. there are always asides, side conversations, people going to get snacks or cross-talk
also to be blunt if i actually wanted to date a girl i WOULD just ask her out right at the table. either you take the L and know exactly where you stand, or you are richly rewarded for not being a fucking faggot
<comment>
32 and experiencing this too. Every girl I meet has a bf already. The only ones interested on dating apps are fat single moms (usually a few years older), who think they can use me as their provider. I've even tried to bang a few when they weren't fat but it's always the same "I only want something serious and I'm experienced now and don't move fast".
Knowing every girl close to my age has had sex thousands of times is very discouraging and I don't feel like just being the next guy in line. Everything will be new for me and she'll have experienced everything with multiple previous boyfriends.
At least family/friends stopped asking me when I'll get a gf because they also know it will never happen.
<comment>
Dude just fucking leave the country. If you even remotely have your shit together then there's no logical reason to put up with ran-thru western roasties. More, and more men are taking the geomaxxing pill. Go now before hoeflation spreads there and you lose your only chance at a normal life.
<comment>
Dude, the answer is obvious, stop dating. Since you're older and probably not rearing to go all the time, it will probably be easier.
The only excuse for sticking with it is if you are literal high-test and Gigachad who has young women wallowing all over him all the time, and let's face if if you were you wouldn't be here and complaining about women on the Internet.
Not to be rude, but why would you even post this thread?
<comment>
fortunately eye contact was and is not that big of a problem for me, unfortunately holding a conversation with a single girl is. The nerves just take over.
You see, the whole concept was so uncomfortable to me from the get go. But if your buddy goes out of his way this much to hook you up, you cant deny the invitation so I went out of appreciation for that. And also his gf actually just wanted to play the games. I went with some interest to see who she is of course, but mostly just the board game aspect in mind. I dont know how you are supposed to rizz a stranger up over an evening of rolling dice (as if i could do it in other settings anyways). and for all I knew, the chick could have been an ugly land whale.
I mean, how can you not get hit on and accidentally slip into a relationship as a woman of age? There are dudes asking you out while you are just grocery shopping. you can take your dirty unwashed body out in pyjamas and just fall on dick. so what business does she have meeting a complete stranger that way.
If you want to set us up and shes so desperate to get to know someone, give me her number and we take it from there, cold approach, clear intentions from the beginning. But starting with some casual, platonic friendship type events in groups? 
Like I said, its a safe space but quickly becomes a detriment.
Also it was just the four of us. My buddy, his gf, the girl and me. Not much potential to be
talking to her a bit more than the others
as we just joked around while playing. not a party type setting with 10 people at the table and time for personal conversations that happen at the side. As you just pay attention to the actual happenings, its hard to be like "uh so tell me uh whats your favorite breakfast cereal" while waiting for your turn as we were half of the room
<comment>
I've honestly been thinking about it. Saw a girl from Philippines a few times when she was in my country visiting her sister. Their look on relationships is so different, and she actually cared about me. It was such an eye opener.
Ideally I'd have a Korean girl, but I believe they've been westernized a lot and have very high demands. Plus preferring their own race, unlike the SEA girls.
Pretty sure I'd swim in pussy there since the last dating app I have, I get flooded with likes from girls from those countries who change their location. Finding one and getting her to move to you are two different things though.
<comment>
I wasnt sure what I was thinking of the situation that evening and still might not know. shes good looking, but not conventional. think billie eilish but without the empty, soulless, rachet expression. certainly didnt have me on the first look.
as she wants to meet again and repeat it, I will see if that actually happens and if thats the case, I cant be that much of a failure. Maybe it boosts my confidence. I had the feeling she was more nervous than me, but then again im a retard so who am I to tell. Maybe it will leave more room and time for convos. But i fear if we repeat that shit for three times without me asking her out its ogre. Friendzone time. New guy bonus and appeal gone.
either you take the L and know exactly where you stand, or you are richly rewarded for not being a fucking faggot
but I am a fucking faggot if you havent noticed by me hijacking a thread blogposting about how beta I am and how I can hardly contain my spaghetti. I cant let my balls hang and be like "you are already leaving? thats sad, it was good fun, maybe i can take you out for dinner some time?". that shit doesnt come out of me spontaneously. maybe next time i can ask her if i can accompany her to the train station down the road and wait for her train to pick her up. Ask if shes interested and meet one on one some time. alleviates the stage fright of bombing in front of my peers. Doesnt sound half bad right now, will contemplate.
But man, you call a girl to ask her about her day? damn. i would call her to set a date and time and ask her about her day then. who wants to have a fucking phone conversation in the year of our lord 2020+3. worked with my ex but it felt like cock and ball torture extracting every reply out of her like pulling tractor tires out of a rainpipe
btw thanks anons for reading all that shit by me and even trying to help
<comment>
Ahahaha why? Dude just keep going, I am 33y old virgin and there are things that keep me awake at night but 3DPD ain't it. Bruh. You made it. You avoided promiscuous whores for 30years, why throw it away? Like you said, they are used goods who gave their entire body in instant to bunch of Chads, they enjoyed cock carousel and now they expect you to wait, take time, win her over, shower her with attention, complements, gifts, and then maybe she will give you trial version of something other man had for free, and they had full version of excited exploratory girl who tried everything with them. But with you it will be "No, stop, I did it before and I don't like it" "No, I'm not that girl anymore" "No, I can't, It was my experimental phase" "No, we can't, I was exploring myself back then". Dude just give up on 3DPD, add to that fire in you if you must, hate them if you want, ignore, forget, avoid, remove from your life. It's for the better.

Find an ugly girl who is marginally more attractive than you, but young, while youre the older guy with money. 
That seems like the only way to not be betabux or a lifelong incel.

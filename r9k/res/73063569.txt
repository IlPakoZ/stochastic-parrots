you live in an apartment
pic related, 27, is your neighbor
she works as a remote worker, so she spends most of her time in her apartment
you left your window open one day while you were playing Smash Bros, and she heard
she asks if you would like to come over and play with her sometime, maybe order some pizza
How do you respond?

Yes because she seems very sweet and its not impossible to lose some chub!

Feed her until she is 600lb so that she dies from a heart attack.

"Sure, sounds like fun." Then proceed to have an enjoyable time playing games and eating together.

Sounds like she wants to murder me and harvest my organs. Literally unknown person and suddenly wants to become my peer? Fucking Chinese black market government scam.

No harm in playing video games. I've been friends with many fat people throughout my life. 
I don't think I could get aroused by someone that fat though, so if she's looking for something more than just a videogame partner, she's in for a disappointment.
I am in good shape myself, only 13% body fat, so I don't think that my standards are unreasonable. Girls must be within 10lbs of pic related, otherwise they're too fat for me to consider for sex

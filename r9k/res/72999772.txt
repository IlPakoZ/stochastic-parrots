New 'toss, though.
no Lee bait?
left side broken window btw
This guys comics are hot garbage.
Ngl, it took me a long time to understand what the conversation was even about. Walkable cities from what I understood just means having all necessities close by so you don't have to drive across town to fulfill your basic needs. I don't see what the conspiracy is about. Suburbs are a mess for traffic and always have been, surely everyone can admit that even if they like their yard and pool and whatever else. Isn't there any way to fix them by building institutions and shops close by?
What makes you think that? Do you have any proof?
Behold, the aforementioned heated refuse.

I'll admit, I lol'd.
Citycucks sure are something. They have a major case of Stockholm Syndrome staying in their concrete jungle with all the noise and air pollution.
Theres nothing wrong with bottom pic, that is not your typical suburb. The typical suburb people have an issue with are the ones with psycho HOA's that require your entire property be covered with regulation 1-inch cut grass, the type of suburb that would fine and evict you if your house looked like the bottom pic. Those retarded places are actually a massive drain on our resources because they are not self sustinable, they produce nothing, and they can barely fit one family for every massive yard of useless water-hungry grass.
Dude I have to drive half an hour to get to work every day, I can't live in the city I work in because real estate prices are so crazy, if I'm driving half an hour to get home anyways I just do my shopping on the way home, with my car.
Said nobody ever. Seriously, how is this a conspiracy? Oh no the WEF will put armed guards in my cul-de-sac like it's the Berlin Wall or something!
this is like 6 months old

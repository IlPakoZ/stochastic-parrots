Do you believe in epiphanies, call to adventure, signs from above etc? I don't even necessarily feel like a "believer" but I seem to experience these intense spiritual experiences quite regularly. 
Lately I've been hit with an immense clarity that I've never experienced in my life before.

That's your bussy awakening, op. You were born to get TOPPED on Grindr and find God through your boy pussy.

Epiphanies exist. They come from above I believe. The call to adventure can either be made up (mentally: such as all religion [Muslim, modern Christianity, etc.]) or divine: (spiritual experiences that transcend time, such as dreams of future parts of your life).

Yes. That's how I feel regularly. Like I've just been dropped a little vision, feeling or nugget of wisdom that transcends time and space completely. But you can't really talk to people about this stuff without coming off like a nutjob. I mean even most religious people don't really think like this.

A job is called a 'vocation' because you are celled to it.

I've had a series of undeniably accurate premonitions from my dreams which always come true. I have always known to trust my internal voice, and now I know God is guiding my way.

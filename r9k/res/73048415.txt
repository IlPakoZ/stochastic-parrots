Do you believe in epiphanies, call to adventure, signs from above etc? I don't even necessarily feel like a "believer" but I seem to experience these intense spiritual experiences quite regularly. 
Lately I've been hit with an immense clarity that I've never experienced in my life before.
That's your bussy awakening, op. You were born to get TOPPED on Grindr and find God through your boy pussy.
Epiphanies exist. They come from above I believe. The call to adventure can either be made up (mentally: such as all religion [Muslim, modern Christianity, etc.]) or divine: (spiritual experiences that transcend time, such as dreams of future parts of your life).
Yes. That's how I feel regularly. Like I've just been dropped a little vision, feeling or nugget of wisdom that transcends time and space completely. But you can't really talk to people about this stuff without coming off like a nutjob. I mean even most religious people don't really think like this.
sounds like it could be my old friend mania, but hey whatever works
A job is called a 'vocation' because you are celled to it.
*called
damn, the wage slavery is hitting hard tonight
I've had a series of undeniably accurate premonitions from my dreams which always come true. I have always known to trust my internal voice, and now I know God is guiding my way.

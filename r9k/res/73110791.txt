I just got back from seeing the new Mario movie, and everyone else in the theater was drunk, rowdy and horny. It got me thinking about the inherent risk of sexual assault/rape when going to the movies. Have you ever been raped or sexually assaulted in a movie theater?
Only rich people go to theatres where I live so I don't see much rape and sexual assault happening.
I wonder if you realize how irreversibly you've actually burnt me
The theater I go to has a balcony and I've often fantasized about getting raped in the balcony.
I fucking fell asleep and a girl working there tried blowing me after the credits. She had that real femcel vibe going.

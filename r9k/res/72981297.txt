I can do 5 pull-ups. AMA
can you do 6
I can do infinity.
I did, once. My arms really hurt afterward because I'm a walking pile of bones.
You've got me beat, that's for sure.
same. I used to feel really weak until i stopped comparing myself to others. I only compare myself to myself now.
So in other words your low self esteem has led you to denying your flaws forever. I know some people who turned out that way.
i don't deny it. I just don't focus on it because if I do i'll never be happy. there will always be someone that's better than you. As long as I'm doing better than I was the month before I'm happy
I can do 10, but I'm trying to work up to 3 sets. Remember bros, one second up, two seconds down.
I can do 0.
I've never managed to do a single proper push-up either.
I can do 5 muscle ups
I can do 3x5 chinups with 55lbs
I did pullups like 5 years ago, I bought the doorframe bar and could barely even do 1 when I first got it
After like 3 months I could do like 3 sets of 15, then 12-13, then 10-11, maybe another 1 or 2 &lt;10 sets...Actually they were chin-ups though, not pullups
That's not what he's saying
This can be interpreted how you're interpreting it (like a pussy)
It can also be interpreted as anon being a self-actualizing human being who sets his own terms and boundaries
I live the same way. If I compared myself to others, I would probably need to use their metric and feel bad because I don't have a high paying job or a girlfriend
But I compared myself to myself, and have my own metric
So I'm proud of my physical prowess and my mental acuity, and my ability to withstand the kind of emotional pain that normalshits would cry out for medication to deal with

states that saying compliments to a raging bpd woman will calm her
Why the fuck should I placate a raging overgrown toddler with tits. Are there other wayd to deal with BPDemons?

you have no obligation to any girls with BPD except if there was one you love which clearly there isn't, therefore your post is redundant because there's no situation where you would have to be supportive to a borderline girl. stop being a cunt to people with an incurable and extremely painful mental illness

yes. avoiding them.

No because they will genuinely convince themselves that they're worthless and everyone hates them

angry BPDumbshit
We have to suffer your existence, therefore we have to have ways to deal with your shit. The only other way to deal with you is to genocide you away, but that isn't an option.
Have a sweet bear to calm your toddler-like mind

thank you anon, that's the nicest thing anyone has done for me in quite a while. i don't care that you're being a jerk about it, that's a very cute bear. i do feel much calmer actually.

Not only is that too much to ask, but it doesn't work in the first place. An actual BPD will just get angrier if you do that.

I think I finally understand women now
holy fuck

The question is, how do you calm a BPD man.
Such a man must be legendarily evil. Perhaps all of them were always culled so that only female versions of those are evolutionary propagated.

You forcefeed him antipsychotic medication.

they're mainly in jail
BPD girls send psycho apeshit texts when they feel ill used and disrespected over tiny things. BPD men start hitting people

BPD is mostly in women because it's femalebrain on steroids, similar to how autism is mostly in men because it's malebrain on steroids.

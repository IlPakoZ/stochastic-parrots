watching my friend play project zomboid on his laptop 
I dont even really play video games but I have fun watching him and he likes it too
 can you pick up that lawn flamingo?
uh, I dont think so
 this game is stupid then haha
today (a week later) 
he shows me hes decorated his and his online friends entire base with plastic lawn flamingos, at least one in every room, the lawn carpeted in them, just so he could show it to me
I am hopelessly in love with this man. Chivalry is not in fact dead
<comment>
And yet, you will not attempt to become his girlfriend and marry him. As a result, he will become weird and isolated before becoming a sexual predator or mass murderer.
Many such cases.
<comment>
Video games suck also I hate happy people
<comment>
Just make a move
<comment>
Hes gay I think, as are all the good ones lol.
Ive given him more chances to make a move than I ever have for anyone and hes turned them down, so im trying to be happy with us being ultra mega best friends who spend most of every day together (pic rel is the two of us, he gets annoyed sometimes because he says I talk too much and too loud when I get excited (every time I see him I get excited))
<comment>
Got any more art?
<comment>
What do you talk to him about?
<comment>
Why not make a move yourself for once?
<comment>
So you're "hopelessly in love" with him, but all you do is giving him "chances to make a move" (God knows what does this mean). Gosh I hate women sometimes.
<comment>
Im on mobile but Ill see if I can find something. Here, heresa digital drawing I did of him a while ago
My favorite games (rn tf2), music, the internet, my archiving projects. I give him my mix cds sometimes. He talks to me about his writing, and his projects, and sometimes cars, I know so much more about cars and car games since I met him
It makes me feel desperate and pathetic. Also if he hasnt taken the hint so far hes obviously not into me that way and it would just be super awkward
<comment>
Why are women always into fucking losers like in OP but never into me? I'm a loser too! I live with my parents, I have a PC I use for gaming, I have unkempt hair and I never shower!
<comment>
You should just go for it. If he's gay, it won't be weird when he turns you down formally. It's not like he could have ever liked you romantically if he's just not batting for that team, so no hurt feelings. 
Guys seemingly either refuse to date their friends or want to fuck all their friends. It's entirely possible he's just in the former camp.
<comment>

Nah, he likely has been conditioned to believe he has no chance with you and is lucky to have you as a friend. He probably has no idea you even like him. He probably just thinks you're generally an amazing person who views him as a friend.
You sound young and naive. So is he. You should make a move. At your age the girls tend to be more aware of how to navigate attraction.
<comment>
Hes gay
he might be but he's probably autistic and will therefore never, ever make a move or register any signals that you're giving him
from personal experience you're literally going to have to grab his penis for him to realize you want him
<comment>
Ive given him more chances to make a move than I ever have for anyone and hes turned them down
Lmao so you basically didn't do shit so shut the fuck up. You can't call the man gay if you literally didn't make a move.
<comment>
So you me!, you threw up some phony "signal" that was supposed to indicate he could whip it out and shove it in?
Seriously, you need to be over and explicitly say you have a crush on him and want to shack up. Anything short of that is going to be 100% lost in translation for some computer nerd.
<comment>
This comic encapsulates liking someone 
Women get "the ick" over men doing stupid shit like having to go get a haircut because they don't like those guys and are probably closeted dykes
Yet when it's a guy they like, rambling about nerd shit makes them horny
<comment>
He made everything in the game into a flamingo just for you, that was his move and you shot him down, you probably won't even be hanging out or see each other again for the rest of your lives 6 months from now
<comment>
NOOO why can't moids just read my mind
I hate women so fucking much.
<comment>
if he's autistic he will never notice your signals
he will never entertain the idea you may be into him
<comment>
Examples of me sending him signals
leaning onto him when he was showing me a video on his phone. He said what are you doing anon why are you like, on top of me? I said oh, uh, sorry 
 made a joke about one of our friends being his bf, he said no, Ive known him for like 2 mo were not even close. I said so what youre saying is I dont need to be jealous? He didnt respond to this
regularly sending him drawings Ive made of him, and telling him hes a super fun guy to draw because hes so thin and elegant. He also knows usually I only draw the pretty girls in my classes who i openly describe to him as my obcessions
I feel like I flirt embarrassingly hard with him a lot and he just chooses to not acknowledge it
<comment>
I hope I can offer a realistic understanding based on my autism.
#1
This could be easily played off as you being a bit silly, hence the "sorry" afterwards. In fact, saying "oh, uh, sorry" after would make my completely dismiss it.
#2
This one took me a bit of thinking to figure out, and I reckon the guy's lack of response is him being confused. Other than that it seems a bit straightforward, but if it was *that* straightforward then I would just expect someone to confess directly, therefore ultimately making me dismiss it as well.
#3
This one seems close to an actual act of flirtation. I think I myself might pick up on that, but that's only because I've missed many similar situations before.
Please just give him a note or explicitly say "I like you as more than a friend". It might be antithetical to your feminine nature, but being direct seems like the only winning case when it comes to such individuals.
<comment>
Eagerly following this thread. I agree with the anons in here that say you should be more direct with your feelings, because he could be in really deep denial about your feelings for him!
<comment>
Have you tried asking him out, anon? I feel like this is pretty straightforward.
<comment>
i would hardly take those as signals. and if yes, i'd be on high alert for some ulterior motive, like being ridiculed or something. but i'd be hiding all my doubts well inside. as many other anons said in this thread, be straightforward.
<comment>
I don't know what I fucking expecting but I did expect it to be exactly as vague as this shit.
On the first one you should have just said it feels comfortable and you like him or something instead it comes off you really did it on accident or were messing with him it's easy for a guy to misinterpret.
The second one is ridiculous if anything he is confused about you asking if a guy is his bf and thinks you might be a creepy fujo instead of gf material. The strangest thing is his answer isn't I am not gay though so I can understand you getting the signals crossed.
The third one, even that isn't over because clearly you are drawing lithe people and even refer to then similarly. Is he supposed to thing you draw both him and them platonic or that you are gay for those bitches?
Seriously Femanon just be straight snd say you like him. He is most definitely not "choosing" to ignore flirting. Women always bank on this that the guy will recognize flirting, but if anything you are probably ALWAYS like this around him and so he thinks it is just your normal personality and you are like this with everyone you hang out with. That does not work on inexperienced guys.
<comment>
All of those are so vague and can have alternative explanations. If anything I feel the guy got even more confused from those signals.
<comment>
OP my wife says you need to just nut up and confess and your vague sense of flirting is sad.
<comment>
He may have noticed and chose to ignore them because he's gay, but holy shit you're not making it easy. 
I said oh, uh, sorry
Why the fuck would you apologize and make it seem like it was an accident? He's evidently confused as to why you're suddenly becoming physical and you play it off like you were being absent minded and embarrassed. Net zero for attraction indication.
Calling him gay then immediately going into ambiguous possessiveness
What did you think was going to happen? This can be taken so many ways but the only thing that objectively sticks out is that you asked if he had a boyfriend. Do you wish I was gay is what I'd be asking myself if that was me, not does she really like me. I'd say net negative indicator in this case.
Drawing him
Decently clear but the reasoning is too esoteric. Try continuing along this line but really just going for the throat, blatant and unmistakable, if you want him to understand. 
thin and elegant
Gayest attributes you can ascribe to a man. You really sound like you want him to be gay.
In conclusion you're both autistic and deserve each other.
<comment>
Poor guy, these signals probably just confuse the shit out of him if he is inexperienced. And if he likes you he will be really hurt if you move on without confessing more directly, especially if you go on later to say that you had a crush on him. Just ask him out and stop toying with this fucker.
<comment>
Honestly no shame and well done. You flirted very well and he probably genuinely is just inexperienced or shy. Remember that it's not just that he has to get the signal. He also has to wager how likely it is that you really are into him, then weigh that against the cost of the friendship. As I said earlier, it's a cost that some men (and women) simply don't want to make. 
I seriously doubt he is gay based on just this information. 
I do wish he would wake up and ask you out too, OP. Sadly, it's probably not going to happen at this point. You can't flirt much harder than this without just asking him to dinner lol. That he is still into you and would date you, though, is very much on the table. I would encourage you to take a leap on it and maybe brainstorm up ideas on how you can do it. 
My main worry is simply that he is not into you and you will get your feelings hurt. I think it is a risk worth taking, but only you can decide if it is.
<comment>
I mean, this is way more direct than I typically am, and most guys that Ive been interested in in the past have gotten the point pretty immediately. Like, when I do things like this I feel like im being embarrassingly, pathetically obvious. 
you want him to be gay
I was pretty sure he was gay until like a week ago when one of our mutual friends mentioned it and he explicitly said hes not gay. Id like it if he wasnt but desu Ive thought of him that way for a long time
<comment>
Well the guys here think you clearly sren't being direct enough and no, no form of hints will ever be "direct"
I wouldn't listen to >>73189393 clearly another female. So many people here are telling you it was a mixed signal for him. Even my wife thinks your attempts are cringe and you should just confess.
These other guys you flirted with are probably more experienced and knew how to pick then up. This guy spends all day playing projectzombie, he isn't one of those guys. It's amazing that you love him and if you truly like this guy then you need to actually shoot your shot.
So far you have spent the whole thread making excuses about why you already tried. That's all bullshit. Just tell him how you feel. Directly.
<comment>
That's precisely it though. Your argument rests on the idea that he is obtuse to the flirting, but if he is truly obtuse then we have no way of judging whether or not he's into her. It's more likely that he has a genuine don't shit where you eat policy. It might sound unbelievable to some, but it's something I personally had for years until I finally broke it and am now in the LTR with that girl years later.
Flirting, until now, was a perfectly valid strategy and she did very well. The whole point, you might recall, is to avoid having to undertake the risk of deducing if he is interested before a proposition is made. Instead, he would simply proposition on his own. Her "mixed signals" of charmingly drawing him like she's an anime protagonist and openly mate guarding him like she's a horny baboon can really only be interpreted one way. 
OP has to deduce if he is interested, then weigh the risk that he is not against the reward and choose to do it. It would be very foolish of us to recommend she leap into action. Though it might be genuine inexperience, he could also just not be interested or half-hearted about it.
The reality is that /r9k/ is full of men who see themselves as the shy boy who was afraid to make a move. We are all too eager to project that on every situation we encounter and think it's righteous to do so, as if we've somehow earned respite for that scared child. We have absolutely no idea if this guy that OP is crushing on is anything like us and cannot assume so.
<comment>
I think you are missing a big point which is the end result. The idea of whether he is obtuse or not into her is irrelevant. Everyone understands perfectly that there is a chance he might not be into her but doing fun things like the flamingo suggests otherwise most guys don' just hang out with girls platonically when they are single.
He clearly enjoys spending time with her enough that her bad read assumption was that he must be gay and she is his faghag instead of him not being into her.
She can choose to shoot her shot and have a chance that he likes her... or she can lament that he didn't throw himself at her feet and pity herself in her own inaction saying it was never meant to be.
Girls are always telling guys to just shoot your shot at the girl she may like you, why the fuck can't I give girls the same fucking advice? It's what anyone would tell any fucking man so damn right I am going to hold this girl accountable for not doing anything if she likes him.
Like it has been mentioned she draws a lot of people and claims obsession with all of them. Is he supposed to think she is gay for those girls she draws too or that he is just a subject like the others? Is making accusations is he is gay at the same time as acting jealous supposed to make any sense? You assertion thst it was openly mate guarding is a little ridiculous considering we don't have a transcript of the actual conversation. Sounded more to the rest of us like an offhand comment there are any number of reasons she could have been jealous besides romantic ones.
<comment>
just say Im interested in him romantically straight up
Thats fucking terrifying dude. I can only imagine how awkward that would be if I directly asked him out with no ambiguity to weasel out of it later and he said no. Also, this guy is my best friend, we specifically set up our schedules so we have two classes together and we walk together to almost all the others. All my friends are his friends and vice versa. We support each other unconditionally and I speak to him about things I had never said out loud before. I spend at least half my day with him every single day and have for the past two years. Hes gotten in an actual fistfight for my sake. If I managed to make our relationship awkward or ruin it I would actually kill myself. 
The way he acts around girls is very weird. Hes extremely uncomfortable with anyone mentioning sex, like to the point the group having conversations about which celebrities we think are hot make him uncomfortable enough to leave the room. This is how I was unaware if he was gay for two years and felt it would make him too uncomfortable if I asked. Ive never seen him flirt with anyone, and the one time last year (when I had just met him recently) I told him I knew a girl who liked him and he started to prepare to reject her before he even met her.
<comment>
Yeah it's very scary he sounds chill enough that you guys might get over it though. Sounds more like he is into you and still is oblivious or he is ace in which case I doubt he would fault you. I personally wouldn't get in a fist fight over a girl I am just friends with.
Seriously rooting for you, girl. I bet all your friends already think of you two as a couple or something this shit is like watching uzaki-chan
<comment>

You seriously, actually, genuinely, truly think a guy would do that for a girl he isnt interested in? Are you fucking retarded or something? Im gonna let you in on a little secret, if you arent repulsive then looks arent the issue, and if he is willing to do this shit then he is definetly interested. Men are generally alot less picky looks wise than women are. 
Thats fucking terrifying dude. I can only imagine how awkward that would be if I directly asked him out with no ambiguity to weasel out of it later and he said no.
 If I managed to make our relationship awkward or ruin it I would actually kill myself.
How do you think he feels? You want him to put all the risk on his own back? 
Hes extremely uncomfortable with anyone mentioning sex, like to the point the group having conversations about which celebrities we think are hot make him uncomfortable enough to leave the room.
He is a touch bit autistic. 
I told him I knew a girl who liked him and he started to prepare to reject her before he even met her.
Firstly if he wanted to date you he wouldnt accept a date from a girl infront of you now would he? Also in his eyes how is he supposed to think that a girl who is trying to set him up with other people is interested in him?
Stop toying around with this fucker, you have dug him into a hole with all these negative signals that he thinks he has no chance, coupled by the fact that he is clearly abit autisitc. 
You are a retard and are actively making this harder for yourself and for him. And you can fix it by simply doing what you expect him to do. Ask him out for fucks sake.
<comment>
Hes gay I think,
if that was the case, you would be aware of it
just tell him how you feel
<comment>
Hes gay I think
So you admit there's no downside to confessing to him.
If he's gay then he'll just say "nah sorry I like dudes but we can keep going to the mall together, girlfriend" or whatever homos say nowadays.

It's only awkward if you make it so.

<comment>
socially inept boy likes girl
girl likes him and gives him hints he has no way of getting (yes, even the "obvious ones". put his hand on your leg and lean in for a kiss if you want to be obvious.)
she thinks he's gay
tough.
be more obvious. start talking about risque topics.
<comment>
I said oh, uh, sorry
should've said you liked him
playful like "because i like you, dummy."
<comment>
based cute friendlationship anon
<comment>
You know you could just say 'I think we get on great. Maybe we should go out on a date together' 
Then after laughing a little with him about it, be like 'no I am actually being serious about it' and then go in for a kiss. 
He might be like me anon. I have always brushed off any idea anyone has ever been into me because Im insecure about my own appearance. 
Rationally I'm pretty average, but irrationally in the moment all I can think about is how disgusting and unworthy I am and the words are there but I just wont ever say them, then find an excuse to leave.
You HAVE to chance it. Because if he ends up like me in his 30s alone he'll be ok, but kind of sad and locked into himself.
So do it for him too.
<comment>
this thread has gone on too long i post a lot of dumb blogposts, a lot of them about him, but they mostly go straight to the archive >>73190738
ty. i like to think so
i draw on windowsills and desks at our school a lot and he can recognize my artstyle so he sends me photos of every one of my doodles he notices. so at the very least its recognizable
hindsight is 2020 but in the moment i was nervous and didnt expect to get any pushback on that action, i hadnt known him for very long at the time so i was more shaky in his presence in general
ill probably never ask him out. im happy with our relationship now, its the closest ive ever been to another person, i can quit while im ahead yk? also, that anon further up was right, he graduates in less than a month and hes moving out to live with his brother after that. so id rather not stain the twilight of our time together with a failed attempt at advances on him.
<comment>
I think you would regret it more if you never did anything. That's what I hear most people say in regards to whether or not you should ask someone out. Might as well shoot your shot while you have the option to!
<comment>
Nah this is stupid
Best case he says yes and you are happy together
One outcome is he doesnt feel that way and you both get over it
The last one is you both are thinking this shit and neither of you makes the move and you both regret it forever
You can be this way whatever just know literally everyone thinks it's time for you to just ask directly.

Is there like a list of "essential" media (games, anime, manga, TV shows, movies, comics, books etc.) that everyone should play, read, watch that's regularly updated? Or individual lists or charts for every media I've listed.

Just consume.

just go to the most mainstream sites for each
wiki best-selling games
MAL for anime and manga
imdb for TV shows and movies
wiki best selling comics
wiki best selling books
then again books are far too many, you'll never read all the mainstream ones even if you live 200 years, you need to pick a certain genre or field at least

Plenty of those. Go on the appropriate boards and ask--or if they're supperior (i.e. /lit/), check their wiki.

women really like good looking men and money
women are too superficial and shallow
this man is a south korean actor who is 20 years older than this woman
and this woman is japanese and the head of a department of japan's largest toy company
in short, this woman is a good looking and highly paid career woman
still, she married a man 20 years older than her, just because he's good looking and famous
i am sure more than 90 % of women have no shame like her
Are you Pajeet? Why do you speak like seething incel freak?
women who marry men twenty years older than themselves are chads.
yes, now the scary part is that they have right to vote and can influence country politics
sorry but men my age (early 20s) are fucking insufferable of course I want a mature older man
women have always married and wanted chad. that guy is like the ultimate husband or boyfriend.
I don't really see anything wrong with this.
He is old but hot.
I'm 15 years older than you and I'm still insufferable but even then I can't stand a vacuous molding onahole like you.
she looks just like jungkook it's adorable
hes handsome though. also she is CUTE he gets to rail that every night

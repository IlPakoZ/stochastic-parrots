i dont even like 3d women, or even women at all. The fuck should i do?
Not your fault Anon. Your response should depend on the severity of the situation. If nothing else happens, you could just ignore it. If it gets worse, confront whoever is making allegations with your side of the story.
You said a male coworker was there as well? He could be a witness. 
Hope this helps.
Bruh man
Fuuuuck...
That sounds like something I would do but at least I'm a tall /fit/ guy so I would get away with it a little despite acting like a sperg but it still would be fucking awkward and maybe even violent
Fuck that woman, she can't take a joke and she's a narcissist, literally not everyone wants to fuck her like she thinks in her head, some people are just silly sometimes like that and she had to make a scene out of it
You're probably not that attractive or something but when some "low value male" asks out a female then she instinctually acts repulsed to show that she's not on your level and to signal she only accepts attractive men
But like she's probably the retard for not getting a joke
You can get the jump on it and do the ol' uno card reversal to her

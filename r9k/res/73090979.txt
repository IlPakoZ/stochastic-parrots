Time moves slow
When you're all alone
And the time moves slow
When you're out on your own
And the time moves slow
When you're missing a friend
And the time moves slow
When you came to the end

Im okay I guess. About to head home. How's your day going sweetie?
Time moves fast when you doing something interesting
Time moves fast when you are fast
Time moves fast when you're focused on something you like 
Time moves fast when you're on the edge of a cliff
Time moves fast when you
if you kill yourself your spark of god will die and you will never get to pleroma and will be bound to this world forever you dont want that bro

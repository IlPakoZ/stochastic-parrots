What are you supposed to talk about with girls?
<comment>
anything if you're tall and handsome. they'll find anything you say interesting, any joke you make funny
nothing, if you're not tall and handsome. they will recoil in disgust from even the most amazing conversation, even the funniest jokes.
simple as.

Anything that crosses your mind as long as it's not creepy. As long as there aren't too many long pauses you're good. It's better to have a mundane conversation than to watch her stare at her phone making it clear that she'd rather be anywhere than with you right now.

the day you realize that you don't actually give a fuck about what women have to say is the day you'll be a lot happier.

Talking to holes is so fucking easy anon. Talk about whatever the fuck you want and never make them feel like they have the power to make you give a shit about whatever the fuck they have to say

girls are just trend chasers 
there is no such thing as a "conversation" with a woman as they are too dumb to think for themselves
instead what you have to do is put up with their bullshit
think of it as a shitty game full of qte
just know that they are aware that you want to fuck them

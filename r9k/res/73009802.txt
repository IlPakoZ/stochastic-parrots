Depends on the type of pill you receive. I don't have ADHD, but I have taken a few amphetamines before (psychedelic amphetamines as well as Adderall). Amphetamines are probably the best drug on the planet. Adderall is weak compared to some of the others in my experience. But it'll help you probably a lot in terms of focus. It's not like bullshit depression pills, pretty sure ADHD pills work. You could always go back for a stronger dosage also.

Good thing I have completely given up on all my dreams of being a success anywhere in life, not like that would ever happen since I am a lost cause and I have no talent.

Very little changes. Everyone probably already thinks I'm weird and stupid, and everything I've posted here is weird and stupid.
except I'd be too terrified to show my face because they'd all know about my fetish

Why wouldn't they already know about your fetish?
<comment>
I fuckin hope they don't already know. Or maybe I do, actually. I'm irrationally terrified of people finding out, so maybe it'd be a good thing to know that nobody actually cares.

I've posted on 4chan for 2 decades but I've always been a liberal and have never written anything offensive here, so I wouldn't care
<comment>
Okay, and?
I've never posted any threats, or done any illegal activity. Most of the time I'm giving advice, or just talking about life and I'm generally very nice to people. Every now and then I'll make a schizopost/schizothread (aliens, ghosts, madeup stories, etc.) because it's funny to me. That's about it.

Are threads still recorded after they drop off the archive?

Who cares, life is overrated anyways, and a lot of good stuff is written here that normies deny for the sake of convenience.

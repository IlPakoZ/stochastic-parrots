I did one of those DNA test things and it showed my heritage was mostly Irish, Czech, and French. Is this cursed or based?

girls that take these sort of St. Patrick's Day pics are boring as fuck and never party hard. They barely even have more than 2 drinks. They just show up to the party/bar/nightclub, take some pics for their instas, leave at around 1 or 2 am.
The real fun girls are those that don't post jack shit but stay in the club dancing and partying up until 5am or closing time. Now those are the ones you wanna surround yourself with, not these vapid boring girls like in the OP's pic.

I'm so so so tired of being lonely, I hate being average, I hate being extremely boring and not having anything to talk about. Every conversation with me feels like a VOID and I'm so TIRED of having to fight for the slightest affection from girls. I can't even do anything about it i don't like any girl around here so my only choice is to look for LDRs and even then I can't keep their attention long enough for anything to happen. I hate that I got cheated on and that it still bothers me and I hate that I still want female affection even though most girls are cruel. I just want to be intimate with a girl I like and I pray to God for someone to come to my life but nothing happens and I'm just so tired of being on my own I can't make anything work
I just want to be sweet 
I want to be a perfect bf for a girl that loves me but no one would ever love someone like me, I'm trying to be a better person and I'm trying to be more fun but i can't see anything working and I feel like crying sometimes I just want a girl to stroke my hair and call me a good boy and let me cry on her chest
I know it's pathetic but i can't help it I've tried being dominant but i feel like I'm forcing it
I'm so tired
Of course the guy she thinks is perfect would never even worry about that sort of thing - he's just himself and doesn't give a fuck if anyone else approves of him or not, if his current gf decides she doesn't like him, he will have plenty of other holes lined up to try out instead and he will be perfectly content regardless of what happens

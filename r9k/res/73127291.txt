My mom's a neurotic fucking mentalcase that beat me till blood came out when i was a kid
My dad is a talented electrician,but outside of his job he's an incompetent bumbling retard that's one greasy burger away from death
Neither taught me anything about life,emulating them got me bullied at school and i don't feel any sort of attachment to them anymore.
My two sisters got all the love,all the gifts and they're constantly bitching about the way i am or why i refuse to talk to my parents
I've officially gotten sick of this shit. Im landing a wagie job and moving out 5 months from now

Oh and i forgot to add,the only reason my mom stopped beating the shit out of me is because my shoulders got broader and i became taller. She didn't feel any lasting remorse for what she did,and she even started spouting off some bullshit about how i would someday start beating her up 
My nose is a bit crooked to the left,and i got a small scar on my upper lip because she would back hand slap me with her ring covered hand everytime i "misbehaved" (did anything you could expect from 6-10 year old)
And this was when we were in public. If it was just me and her and my sisters in the house she would pull my hair,slap me,and drag me around by my feet. 
The first thing she does when she arrives from her job,is to barge into my room and scream at me for no reason at all. She'll just rant about inane bullshit till my head's ringing and i develop a headache,and my two bitch sisters always call me a monster because i don't want to go out and eat ice cream at the beach with the people i hate the most in this whole world

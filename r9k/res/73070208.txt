had sex it was very good. she was tight and wet and we both got off. she seems to like me a lot. i am still depressed and want to die ama
Did you enjoy making her feel good? The actually rewarding part of sex is the emotional satisfaction from making someone you feel affection towards feel nice, and that they like you and are enjoying making you feel nice too. Otherwise it's just masturbating using another person's body
yeah that's how I knew this was bullshit. dumb LARP op.
You emo white bitch. You been emo for like 10 years nigga you still sad? You a weird ass nigga just come out the closet you gay
oh yes that was an integral part of the experience. i would have absolutely hated it if she wasn't into it. i mean i'm now paranoid about her texting her friends "i hated it i was faking he fucking sucks"
i'm sorry about how bad at sex you are
SGP supremacy

Rachel pittman killed 3 people at 17 by herself. Why did she do it. I don't get it.
Probably just angry and fed up. I sympathize with killers, plus it's not like normies have souls so killing them is justified
we will never know. she has an interesting face and i can't really place my finger on why.
She's not pretty but she's not ugly either. How did she kill these people?
its somewhat masculine in appearance. im guessing she had autism and this was an act of autistic psychopathy.
it was definitely a crime of passion.

Americans build houses out of wood. Yes, they're that retarded.
She kind of looks like Kristen Stewart.
holy fuck what a stupid thing to do, even latam monkeys know better building concrete houses
Worse than that. Even niggers, actual African negroes, at least build their houses out of mud. Americans live in houses that will get blown away by a fucking gust of wind.

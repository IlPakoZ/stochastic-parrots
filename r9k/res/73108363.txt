Rachel pittman killed 3 people at 17 by herself. Why did she do it. I don't get it.
<comment>
Probably just angry and fed up. I sympathize with killers, plus it's not like normies have souls so killing them is justified

 judge placed gag order on case
we will never know. she has an interesting face and i can't really place my finger on why.
<comment>
She's not pretty but she's not ugly either. How did she kill these people?
<comment>
its somewhat masculine in appearance. im guessing she had autism and this was an act of autistic psychopathy.

 all three had died from violent injuries inflicted prior to the fire. The three victims had been stabbed to death before the house was set ablaze.
it was definitely a crime of passion.

Americans build houses out of wood. Yes, they're that retarded.

She kind of looks like Kristen Stewart.
<comment>
holy fuck what a stupid thing to do, even latam monkeys know better building concrete houses
<comment>
Worse than that. Even niggers, actual African negroes, at least build their houses out of mud. Americans live in houses that will get blown away by a fucking gust of wind.

the first three days my sister was kicked out of the house for failing school she became a stripper and got immediately adopted by a multi millionaire and lives in his mansion 
He's fucking 35 and actually kind of good looking 
the conversations with this giga chad are some of the most intelligent I've ever had 
says he loves my sister because of how timid and innocent she is, once he heard of her situation he couldn't let it be and took her in 
IT'S NOT FAIR. ITS JUST NOT FUCKING FAIR. SHES 18 AND DIDNT EVEN FINISH HIGH SCHOOL AND IS LIVING A BETTER LIFE THAN I EVER COULD IN 30 YEARS. I HATE WOMEN SO MUCH WHY DO THEY COMPAIN WHEN THEY WILL NEVER BE HOMELESS OR HUNGRY NO MATTER WHAT???

Couldn't you just be happy for your sister? At least she's not a stripper now.
Focus on improving yourself instead of blaming others.

is it a bigger dealbreaker if a girl is trans or if she's fat? (or a dealmaker?? *flushed emoji*)

Trans. I wouldn't mind breeding a slampig but I can't have kids with a tranny.

It's a dealmaker if a girl is fat,
if she's pre-op trans, and is keeping the dick / balls.
It's a double dealmaker if she's both.
It's a dealbreaker if she's post-op.

Trans. Fat women are biological females and have vaginas and can make babies. Trannys are literal men wearing wigs roleplaying as women with stinky assholes covered in poop.

it's a much bigger dealbreaker for a woman to be a man because I don't want to have sex with a man.
<comment>
I only say trans because I have a thing for bigger women.
I'd be with a transwoman any day of the week.

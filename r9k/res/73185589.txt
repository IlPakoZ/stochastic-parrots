<comment>
tfw you remember when /britfeel/ used to have its own unique op image for every month of the year each slightly tailored to the era
now /britfeel/ just has a lazily googled image of a town
Only Ancient Oldfeelers remember.
<comment>
I wonder who used to make the feel street pictures
<comment>
now
we stopped using le special op image years ago because everyone was bored of it
<comment>
we
Who is 'we'?
I distinctly remember the 'lazy google image' op posters would and still do make the thread before it's reached bump limit (often ten, twenty, thirty posts too early) so they could get theirs in first.
<comment>
no SSM update today
It over
<comment>
he thinks reusing the same image over and over isn't lazy
<comment>
He's working today?
<comment>
Why couldn't you address me directly instead of being passive aggressive little lad?
Feel Street OPs require time and effort to make unlike your lazy copy-paste job.
Sad!

Can't believe SSM is Jewish. Sharn't be watching anymore of his videos desu.

Less being bored, and more to do with the fact nobody was actively updating the images anymore with the current going ons of the thread.

<comment>
nothing but bread, gruel and water presumably (eating things that taste good is fun, and having fun is degenerate)
<comment>
Someone probably forgot to scan it dont worry
<comment>
God forbid you eat something not /pol/ approved
<comment>
Yeah probably, still makes me worried. Might shoot them an email to ask instead of calling.
<comment>
WHATS YOUR DIET LIKE?!
NOT EATING GOYSLOP IS RACIST YA KNOW!
<comment>
I'm not fond of fast food either but it must be miserable to live like you, obsessed with jews
<comment>
Why do you care about these things? Genuinely curious
<comment>
Because I am smarter than everyone around me.
<comment>
ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO EAT ANYTHING THAT TASTES GOOD WITHOUT IT BEING GOYSLOP
<comment>
Everyone needs a hobby dont they. Reading, fishing, conspiracy theory, its all good

I really like her. She's sweet and kind. Seems like the kind of person who wants a simple, no-drama, easy going life. If only I could be so lucky to share time with her. We'd go out strawberry picking during the summer and I'd be considerate of her health needs. I wouldn't let her down. I wouldn't want to lose a good girl like that. I don't drink or smoke. I'm pretty sure she doesn't either (too risky for her)...she stopped drinking a while ago.
<comment>
And whats the connection between being smart and /pol/ memes?
<comment>
Never meet your heros mate
<comment>
jeans ripped to show off legs to chad. not smelly virgin like you.
<comment>
/pol/ is a group of enlightened thinkers. We are a legion of intelligence. We see the world as it really is - we learn from graphs on race and politics made with zero sources. It's easy to be like us if you just look.
<comment>
I don't think I could deal with someone like her though. She seems like she enjoys drama and would want to go to expensive places every weekend. Can't be dealing with that. High maintenance.
<comment>
i wonder how nubs is
<comment>
Mate, a women who wants to leave the house once a month would be high maintenance to you lmao
<comment>
Years back i fully believed in /pol/ memes its scary how it can pull you in
<comment>
I never went full Nazi but was a bit of an alt righter. It just felt a bit of fun but then I stopped being a teenager
<comment>
I'd have no chance anyway.
Chad could still be Chad even if he never washed.
<comment>
She married congo George and is living like a queen much to ebins chagrin
<comment>
but he does wash though. learn a thing or two from him
<comment>
I'd have to adjust to the new routine. I could do it if I had a decent job and looks.
<comment>
Was feeling utterly miserable about the state of my life so I downloaded couch to 5k and did a run, first one in a couple of years. It made me feel slightly better about myself but now I just want to eat shit food and drink alcohol to reward myself, it's so hard to maintain good habits, yet I persevere.
<comment>
I'm depressed af. It doesn't really make me feel much better. I'm not going out so no one is dealing with my hygiene anyway. I don't even smell.

<comment>
Keep up the good fight mate
<comment>
When we're finished strawberry picking I would take her towards a secluded woodland spot and tell her how I feel.
<comment>
Stfu you are not me. I would never do that. Weirdo.
<comment>
Thanks lad, much easier when the weather's nice like this.
<comment>
You're a real romantic. Unfortunately the modern world hates romantics and will probably crush your soul but for what it worth you have my respect

Yes, strange, short men are in high demand there. It's a research job
<comment>
Whatcha researching?
<comment>
This is going to sound like a larp but it's completely true and happened earlier today:
Living my best wfh wagie life this morning
Back to work after long weekend and extra day I took off
Catching up on e-mails, notice an issue with a customer account
Ask one of my reports (fat woman in her fifties) to run with it
Hi Karen (not real name), would you mind running
at that point some freak keyboard/mouse combination I perform sends the e-mail which just says 'would you mind running' to the fattest slob imaginable
Obviously try to recall the e-mail
Too late, she's read it
Get a call from my manager 30 mins later asking why I'm sending insulting e-mails to this gremlin
explain the sitch
She (obviously, yet another woman) doesn't find it very funny and says she'll have to consider what to do next
Currently waiting for probably my termination notice letter over something this fucking stupid

pot holes
Doesn't affect me. Will never drive.

Couldn't give a FUCK about normies and their normie issues like pot holes. Until someone is out there discussing how to help incels I don't care.

Food banks should do what those bailiffs do and go round someone's house counting up the value of their unnecessary items. If it's over a certain limit, their foodbank access should be revoked.

You'll probably be alright lad, unless that fatty is very important and/or litigious. And you're a lowly grunt. 
On the bright side, if they do fire you I bet you could sue for wrongful dismissal. 
I'd go through and back up emails you've sent her previously asking her to run reports, if it's a repeated thing you've gone solid ground for proving your side of the story.

Had to put down another deranged Helper the Wumpa Posse rescued from a Goon Dungeon last night. When they found him he'd been hooked up to one of those nightmarish seizure inducing pornography videos for days.
Poor little lid was completely gone. Kept screaming for his 'goon mummy' when he arrived at the HelperShelter.

All drugs are legal in Canada and Trudeau has apparently changed his mind on gun control and we may see gun rights increase. Especially since all Israelis are running away from wonderful Libertarian-Nazi-Commie Canada.
Trudeau does gun control mostly to control Israelis.
Reminder that Palestine never voted to leave Britain and Israel killed British civilians via terrorism and only exists because they threatened to kill more innocent people

I am tired of not living the life I wish I lived so I'm going to grow my big wavy hair out, get my facial hair removed, take female hormones and work out like crazy every day so I can be an androgynous musclegirl tranny thing. Maybe get breast implants but only after like 5 years of hormones to see how big my boobs get on their own naturally. And I'm keeping the dick. Might voice train but who knows. Then if I end up actually looking good and not like most trannies I'm going to cosplay and take slutty pictures of myself and post them online so people can enjoy them.
Wish me luck bots
Taking estrogen and working out to build muscle will shoot you in the foot on both sides. It's a bit like working out to lose weight while drinking a liter of cola and eating a KFC family bucket everyday.
Isn't that beneficial to me if I want to be muscular in a feminine way
Imagine you just decide you don't wanna do that anymore two years down the line and then you're just kinda stuck there like :-|
you're a noble man with a noble goal

Ive finally made peace with being an incel. After enough time exploring the blackpill I finally learned that women are NPCs. They are something other than human. They just follow their base instincts and listen to their pussy tingles. Said tingles are so strong she cant resist, meaning cheating is always inevitable. This is why "patriarchy" was a thing. Women are meant to be our property, basically living breathing fuckhole incubators. I could never love a sex doll and thus I could never love a woman. Being single and playing vidya is my fate.

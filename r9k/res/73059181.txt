Anyone else get pissed off at (blanket term) are (bigger blanket term)? You're not saying what you actually want nor making any argument as to why it should be allowed. Trans rights to what, use the wrong bathroom? Buy a house? Poison a city's water supply?

trans women are women which mean their huge bodies should be allowed to make foids uncomfortable in their own bathroom and they should be allowed to shit all over them in all sports it's their RIGHT #transrights

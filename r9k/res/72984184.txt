Do you or your friends use ebonics?
I am not American but with my friends sometimes use these words ironically since they are considered just Internet culture words I suppose
Kind of hard for me to imagine there are real people who use these words without self-awareness
No and i have no friends
Yes but its weird because it sort of just became considered zoomer language
Why isn't based on the list? Thats niggertalk.
There was a brief period a couple of years back where we would go out of our way to say "finna" because we thought it was a hilarious new low in mainstream language trends. It's less funny now, more sad.
I use "af" and "fr". 
The later I only use as a joke.
Brueiwj yes is e eowowks abuq
hilarious new low
it's exactly the same as the way we say "gonna" instead of "going to"
yas cuh i aint finna talk like sum kinda muhfuggen old ass white dude from tha 80s cuz like ngl that shit deadass aint bussin fr fr gnomesayin?
Things like sus, no cap, tea and sis are not ebonics. Those are made up zoomer internet terms. I dont even think "y'all" counts because its a contraction for "you all". I use words like "aint" and "finna" but thats rare for me.
It's the replacement of the "th" sound with "f" that really lowers the bar. As if saying something like "I'm finkin' of..." wasn't trashy enough, you take it even further by merging the syllables. At least in "gonna" you still have the same initial consonant to link it back to proper english. "Finna" is almost an entirely new word, the etymology is not immediately apparent.
yall is just a southern thing idk why people act like it's niggerspeak or zoomer shit
Finna vibe no cap rn its bussin bussin deadass frfr ngl
Finna comes from ''fixing to'' idiot. It's southern slang.
That's even worse! Even the original form was something reserved for niggers and hillbillies. You can't compare that to "gonna".

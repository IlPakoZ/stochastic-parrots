I took the vaccine and seriously regret it, no boosters but i've never been so sick as i have been the past couple years. I feel like i've made an irreversible mistake, is there any hope or any way out. Also can god forgive me?

Damn if you do damned if you don't. 
Catch COVID you get scar tissue, inflammation, spike protein etc
Get the vaccine you get scar tissue, inflammation, spike proteins, etc
Don't placebo yourself into think your sick. You might actually convince yourself.
When did you take it anon? Post vaccine syndrome is not uncommon. I made the same mistake, 18 months later I am barely getting better, althouhh Ive had a few reinfections that set me back. Most people wont accept or even consider that they fucked up by taking the clotshot, you know that saying of its easier to fool a man than making him admit he was fooled?
irreversible damage
Maybe. It can be mainly but not mutually exclusive 3 things
autoimmunity
The last 2 can be fixed with time and good diet and proper exercise plan. The first one is a real bitch and will drastically lower your life quality, maybe for the rest of your life.
Nobody talks about this anymore, but the data is out there, more and more disability claims

Few can keep up with demanding jobs
The recommendation years ago was to start taking NAC. Look NAC up on the /pol/ archives. 2021 was when I last looked.
I took it because my mom forced me to. The looming threat of sudden death has made me live each day like it may be my last, but with the cautious temperance of someone who may yet live a long life.
I've decided to stop letting them control me and moved out, I'm about to go across the country for a better job because fuck living and dying for my current company underpaid and overworked.
Also a few things proved to be virtually side effect free you should try
I've read so many crazy different theories, for example T-cell depletion caused by immune system overreaction. It means sloooooooow healing without fibrosis
You ever consider that maybe it's the covid and not the vaccine that's fucking you over?
Sounds like hypochondria, like those women who think they have ME
I've been thinking about doing something like that. Don't know where I'd go or what I'd do though
1. you're a liar
2. you never took the vaccine
3. you're no believer in God
All in all you're a demonic piece of shit. Be gone evil spawn of hell. Amen.
covid does the exact same shit.
I know, it's both, didn't say it doesn't. But since we're all going to get it over and over again, it's better to get as much natural immunity as possible. I took it because my family forced me, and I'm almost sure I caught it unvaxxed just a couple months before that. I believe a lot of people had a similar problem, catch asymptomatic, get forced by job to take it, develop autoimmunity
Kys false prophet faggot
Honestly dont know what the fuck else to do. Dear God please help me
As far as I know, yes. Turn to Christ, confess your sins and repent.
If/when they roll out the mark in our lifetime, do not take it.
damn thats too bad. anyway thanks to you the biontech whore is now one of the richest women in germany!
found the demon imp in disguise. didn't take long did it? You've been trying to get me for years but I prevail and denounce your wicked evil ways.

Start getting at least 5-7 hours of moderate exercise per week. You're looking for something that'll get you sweaty enough to want to shower afterwards, but not leave you completely out of breath. If you're the lazy fatass I think you are, a recumbent stationary bike with adjustable resistance would be perfect for you. Also, stop eating sugary, processed goyslop ASAP. I'm not gonna tell you what diet you should do, just that it should be predominantly whole foods that come from farms, not factories.

I appreciate your attempts to help but honestly fucking kill yourself like I told my doctor. I walked regularly everywhere, 10km daily at least plus weekend hikes. I had and still have a good diet. Blood tests say I'm perfectly healthy but I have exercise intolerance. If I go too hard my heart rate shoots up.
Blood panel electrolytes are fine except for low potassium. I already drink +3lts and extra electrolytes
Are you in a particularly dry climate?
Why is it then completely intermittent? 
Early stages. You know how there's pre-diabetes? Think of this as pre-atherosclerosis. 
Shouldn't it get worse with effort?
Not necessarily - it's not strictly a pulse/pressure thing, What you want to watch out for is it getting worse with time.
My fasting glucose was 85 and my a1c was well within normal. My total cholesterol, LDL is in the excellent range.
Your fasting glucose isn't reflective of your normal glucose levels. Cholesterol is unrelated to diabetes.
My diet never gave me issues before the jab.
You've literally never had diarrhea or constipation once in your life before the jab? You're sure recency bias isn't a factor here?
All that outdoor sunlight is probably contributing to your dehydration. Out of curiosity, what's your "good diet"? How often do you eat fast food? We have a medical term for exercise intolerance, it's called "obesity".
Are you in a particularly dry climate?
Nope.
Early stages. You know how there's pre-diabetes? Think of this as pre-atherosclerosis.
Maybe, my hs-crp was 0.45 before the jab, it was at 1.4 some months ago. Pre-atherosclerosis sounds right. I ate a lot of garlic before, still try to if my stomach can handle it, not always.

What? Well that's what the a1c is for no? Unless you mean I have transient hyperglycemia, in which case you're probably right, but I never had it before taking the damn clotshot..
You've literally never had diarrhea or constipation once in your life before the jab? You're sure recency bias isn't a factor here?
Once a year maybe and only if I went full retard mixing orange juice with milk and coffee and chilli
All that outdoor sunlight is probably contributing to your dehydration.
That might be true, that's why I began supplementing electrolytes but levels keep dropping...
Out of curiosity, what's your "good diet"?
Mostly fruit, tuna and deenz, eggs, milk. Little beef and chicken.
How often do you eat fast food?
Almost never unless you count raw peanuts as fast food, shit's expensive yo
Do you know what refeeding syndrome is? After I got jabbed I felt extremely tired so I stopped eating for a week, and because I used to regularly fast before I thought this would be the same. Big mistake. Also exercise intolerance is not exactly what you think it is, you put a fat person on a treadmill and he tires out quickly, but normally recovers in a day or two. The kind of exercise intolerance the jab gives you is one where it takes weeks to recover and you feel like you got the flu, even if you tolerated exercise well the day you did it.
That might be true, that's why I began supplementing electrolytes but levels keep dropping...
Dehydration isn't quite what most people think it is - it's not actually about not having enough water consumption (that's just the easiest way to get it), but actually about the ratio of water to electrolytes being too low. Consuming extra electrolytes is not helping you become less dehydrated, it's doing the opposite. Try slowly weening yourself off for a week while using a moisturizing lotion on one arm but not the other. This way you will be able to observe the effects of decreasing electrolytes on the "dry" arm, while comparing that to how much extra hydration that moisturizing lotion offers your skin on the "wet" arm.
Try adding some fibrous but not starchy vegetables like kale, spinach, etc. 
Also, start taking NAC + Quercetin if you really want to detox from vax. A multivitamin will cover micronutrient deficiencies, too.

Just a week ago I read on reddit of this being the case, thought it was counterintuitive but a few guys chimmed in claiming it was in fact right and that quitting electrolyte supps helped them out... I'll try it and hope it doesn't give me a heart attack

fibrous but not starchy vegetables like kale, spinach, etc.
Started adding parsley here and there for K1 but I'll add those too
Tried them. No notable effect. But you're right it's basically a problem of poor detoxing. 
typing all those so other anons can see it's no joke getting fucked over by the clotshot. It always get said "it's a woman disease" or "just exercise or start eating healthy", if anything hardcore athletes get hit the hardest because their bodies already operate at their limits. And doctors are completely useless, they tell you it's all in your head. Until it's not and you die. Wouldn't be a problem if they didn't gatekeep some important medical tests and drugs.

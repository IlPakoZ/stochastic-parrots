it's a big load off your shoulders once you realize that's all they care about. You don't have to have a perfect body with designer clothing and lots of money-- women don't give two shits about that. They just want some tall guy with a nice face. So many dudes have this mindset and obsess over primping and preening themselves even moreso than women do when it doesn't even matter.

Right on. Good to see that the echo chamber is working as intended.

Why am I a virgin then?

i disagree. as a girl, looks dont matter much to me. ive fallen in love with ugly robots because we shared similar interests or coz they give me lots of attention and made me feel special. once you become important and interesting to me, ill most likely be attracted to you too

Because what matters is not your opinion, but what women actually think about you.

walk into balenci make em wipe me down

Because that's all you can get. The presumption that attractive people are mean is a cope. There are plenty of attractive guys who also fit your other criteria. It's not too hard so long as you are attractive too.

It figures that you would take random 4chan posts seriously. That is one of the flimsiest justifications you could have come up with.

using gaslighting and virtue signalling as solid evidence
Lol, what a gullible faggot.

Yes, women approach me to tell me I look good and ive been asked out by random women I have never spoken to before. They always lose interest before the sex happens
<comment>
Wha, almost like women like men with good genes and are repulsed and disgusted by those without. Women fear bad genes anon. For many reasons.
<comment>
Just because they have buyer's remorse does not mean it has nothing to do with your looks.
I have no idea what type of women are asking you out. It could literally be women who want attention that find you pleasant enough to flirt with, but not enough to go through with.

Girls liked me in school despite me being a fat fuck. I was taller than most people with a decent face

I've attracted shy girls, some really hot (8+ range), but I'm too autistic for any social interaction, and they won't start it either, at best make themselves open for an approach, which is something I cannot do.

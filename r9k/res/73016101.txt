You gotta really have no real problems at all in your life, if you really think the worst problem you have is being alone forever.

I've literally been homeless, being alone is worse.

I don't, but I recognize that, in addition to my own numerous flaws and problems, the state of the average person (women especially) is not in a place where I really care much about whether or not I remain alone until my grave.
I suspect that a person who asks this question is someone who is afraid of being alone themselves.

Like being homeless are even comparative to the terrors of this world. 
You haven't been to hell, you know nothing about hell. You should be happy that you will never know anything about it.

who said anything about looking forward to it
everything only gets worse, whatever rewards there might be will be lesser and lesser in impact

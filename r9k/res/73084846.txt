god why are poor people so fucking insufferable. 
They get literally free handouts that gives them a free pass at life and all they do is mope and complain
I am over here suffering because was born into a lower middle class family and will be stuck that way because of loans.
you can bump loans into the future and postpone them for a really long time
You can also leverage debt forgiveness programs if you're willing to declare bankruptcy and be poor for several years, but that would require you being willing to be poor
yeah while my "poor" friend doesn't have to do any of that shit and gets a free ride?
the entitlement of poor people. i swear

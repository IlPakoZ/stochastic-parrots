Have any of you had any success in online dating or has it just been futile?

No, no successes. It's been pretty futile, people don't want weird, autistic guys.

I actually got a GF of 9 months from OLD once. She was not attractive and I was doing the "just settle bro" strategy. It turns out that strategy doesn't work, I literally couldn't get my dick up with her. Apart from that I had no success with online dating.

If you aren't attractive and don't have good pics don't bother. If you're in the ballpark of average looking you can do well if oyu have interesting pics, but other than that it's 99% looks. I'm average looking at best and a shut in so have no pics to use. Hinge forces you to have 6 pics so chances are I'd give a girl the ick if I had 6 selfies, it's a waste of time, at least for me. Only giga normies can get girls with dating apps, or any guy if he's 7+/10 desu.

That's irl too. Online dating, in the grand scheme of things, is no different to dating irl in terms of who women are attracted to

I had good success and my profile literally said that im unemployed and a druggie. Tinder was a real eye opener. In good and in bad.

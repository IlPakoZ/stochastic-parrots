Who won?
<comment>
i haven't been in a fight for nearly a 6-8 years.
been in 4 fights as a korean guy. All happened in my hs years.
1 with a black guy. Punched me in class and wailed on me.
1 with a white guy. On a school bus i beat his ass well more like punched him and he fell and stopped. People were all laughing at him.
1 with a mexican guy. He was bullying me. I snapped thru a water bottle at his head and started wailing on him. He stopped picking on me afterwards.
1 with another mexican guy. He beat my ass but he jumped me with his friend.

be me, 13 year old girl at the soccer field by myself 
group of guys come over, theyre a grade above me and have called me a baby and bitch multiple times in the hallways at school for absolutely no reason 
hey bitch! Why are you here alone?
I was literally just building a snow fort minding my own business 
main mean guy, max, starts pelting me with ice chunks and calling me names 
I got so fucking pissed I charged at him and started punching and kicking wherever I could 
max cocks back and socks me right in the nose and kicks me in the stomach multiple times and all his friends just laugh at me 
they ruined my snow fort 
I hate any guys named Max and get really turned on when I think about a guy bullying me. Fuck

Havent gotten into many fights in my life. But the few I have been in I won. Granted they were all when I was a kid so I wouldnt put much stock in my fighting ability at all.

Fighting outside of protecting your child, family or girlfriend or for sport is for chimp baboon level human beings, literally risking death and brain damage because egos got hurt.

Have been in multiple fights. Most were won but the ones you lose really put a mental toll on you or maybe it's just me with my ego. I can't forget the humiliating losses and want to track down the people and unironically kill them even though the fights were many years ago.

Me and my brother used to beat on each other for fun until he got too strong and it wasn't fun anymore (I'm a woman and 2 years older than him) we stopped fist fighting at around 12-13
<comment>
Also we used to play a game called who can punch the softest. We'd start out punching each other really soft on the arm then abruptly get harder and go OOPS I LOSE 
Good times I'm laughing just remembering

One time when I was in high school, some idiot tried to fight me on my way out of the locker room. I used my binder as a shield and kicked him in the stomach.
<comment>
That's cute, hope your relationship with your bro is still good, sounds like a nice family

Should have grab his ball and squeeze them.

I had something similar happen as a kid but I just hate bullies now. I'd build little snow castles and the bully boys would come knock them over rinseand repeat
<comment>

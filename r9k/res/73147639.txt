I'm sick of food. I want nothing more than to never need to eat again. Nothing is good anymore. It's so depressing. So much stress just to fuel my worthless body.
I used to feel like this, then I started eating nuts lost of different nuts and some berries, dry fruit
It is a game changer
why are you a worthless bitchass anon?
yeah you should just try changing your diet desu

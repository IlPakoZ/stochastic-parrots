I posted this shit yesterday in another thread already but I wanted to repeat my faggotry and contain it in greentext to make it easier to be ridiculed
I was still thinking about what happened and contemplating how I felt about it days later. At this point I dont even know if I like her or if I just like the thought of liking her.
Even with this once in a lifetime opportunity and all the odds stacked in my favor, I have no motivation to make any moves.
I find it very difficult in that situation of four people playing games to hold a personal conversation and engage one on one. and i got stage fright to bomb in front of my buddy and his gf in case I would actually try to ask her out out of the blue.
the next time we roll it back I will see how I feel about it in the moment. But I want to have a rough plan prepared but im so clueless it hurts. I couldnt advance on a girl in a party, let alone in this casual and platonic scenario
not gonna cut it. waiting for her to advance is certainly no option. my window is probably closed after we met the third time if its even open at this moment.
maybe next time i can ask her if she would mind me accompanying her to the train station down the road and wait for her train to pick her up. Ask if shes interested to meet one on one some time. alleviates the stage fright of bombing in front of my peers. Its the best I can think of so far.
You have to go back
Just ask her out, lets be real, even if someone has solid advice for you know, there is noone to rescue you once you meet a person for real so just get it over with and take the L

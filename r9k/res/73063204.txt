<comment>

<comment>
i wanted to and it was a lot easier to do once i was 18
cult church stuff he was training to be a big pastor and my parents really wanted it to happen they always said it was for me but really they wanted what it would do for them

Tits or gtfo, evangelical thot!

<comment>
Ahhhhh that makes sense. Church cult shenanigans tied with parents using their child to garner favour. Fucking disgusting. 
Glad you got out. What are your plans now? Or has it been a while since this happened?

Idgaf, she is in Texas and I am in aus. This shit is just interesting. More so than the rest of you whiny cunts
As long as it is a decent church then whether you believe or not the camaraderie will help you heal and grow. Actual Christians are pretty based people, even if they are not my type. 
What are your plans from here? With no support network in friends or family, what do you plan to do with your life?
<comment>
please point me to the nearest ripper sir
yeah its just a normal church its way bigger than mine was and everyone here does church because they want to not because they have to
i dont know what my plans are i got my ged during the divorce so i can get jobs but i dont want to do anything really fast yet a couple of years ago i was supposed to be a babymaker i really dont know what i want to do at all
<comment>
evangelicals like to give people bad drugs
<comment>
baby maker 
Kek, but also fucking terrifying. Glad you got out. Hopefully you can get your life on track and make the most of it now you got out whilst still young. Take some time to settle, get some money under you and maybe explore community colleges or a trade to find what you want to do in life. 
Best of luck!
<comment>
Like what? Wine and crackers?
<comment>
i never got any drugs where are the drugs
it is scary because i didnt realize what i was losing i was raised to believe its what im supposed to do but now it makes me sad about my friends who are still there
im not ready for college but maybe someday my job takes a lot out of me
lol

Why do some girls enjoy pegging? It doesnt stimulate them in any way?

Women get turned on in different ways 
Money and power is a big one

Have you read the lolcow femdom threads? There are too many posters on there saying they like pegging for it all to be male LARPers. I really have no idea what's going on with this one.

They don't like pegging, go watch some pegging videos, they still call him daddy and think of it as some sort of service. They have no actual interest in sodomizing a man.

They like the power fantasy and yes it does stimulate them on the clit which is the best part for them anyways.

hi can i apply for this position?
<comment>
do not necessarily have to get sexually stimulated to enjoy something sexual. for example some guys really LOVE eating pussy, some will be happy just eating pussy and doing nothing else. some logic applies to pegging.

It's sort of a "pleasure dom" thing through indirection.
Do you know how there are girls who actually get off to getting YOU off? Well, it's the same thing, taken to a higher level.
Pleasure dom is a fun exercise in power reversal. It's most common when the man is typically very controlling/powerful in the relationship. Actually PENETRATING him is taking it to the most logical endpoint.
It also involves a fair bit of "weakness revealing". Despite what you might read on /r9k/ sometimes, women do actually find it attractive when their partner reveals his weak side, but, again, ONLY if the man is usually very dominant in the relationship. Revealing one's weakness to your girl is the ultimate sign that you actually trust her, and the stronger is the juxtaposition between you "outside self" and the "inner self" you show only to her, the strong is the effect.
Being pegged, then, is the ultimate show of weakness. Again, very attractive, assuming that normally you are not the sort of guy who looks or acts like you like taking it up the ass.

My wife is smaller than me and said she loves the feeling of power and size difference. 
It's mostly a mental thing.

do girls actually like disgusting buttholes? im a guy and a lot of guys like girl buttholes but i hate them and they must be 10x as disgusting on a dude
<comment>
This is very accurate. Im mostly dominating my gf irl and sometimes during blowjobs she sticks a finger or two up my ass.

Look alive faggots

Same reason why some people enjoy getting cucked, it's the physiological aspect that turns them on
<comment>
I guess maybe if they're lesbian or bisexual and do it with each other but I bet they don't like doing it to men

I was hanging out with some people for new years getting drunk, and this one girl couldn't help but spill the beans that her ex had asked her to peg him and she thought it was like the weirdest, grossest thing.

If I ever get a girlfriend do I tell her I'm a virgin or tell her I've fucked over a 100 escorts? I'm scared she'll ask who I fucked and I'll get nervous and get caught lying.
Just say you arent a virgin and dont elaborate. Most women don't pry about specifics like body count. Especially normies.
Which episode is this thank you
Just do what I did, say youre not a virgin but youve been single for a while. This way you dont look like a loser but you can explain away any awkwardness or nutting too quick
I have the same question. My body count is 15, all prostitutes. I started to date a pure girl now and I don't want to lie about virginity but I also don't want to hide the prostitutes thing.
I think I will just say that I fucked a mexican girl while I was at college, but we never actually dated.
She's probably fucked 100 guys so it evens out
GDP 449
I've fucked over a 100 escorts from all over the world and I'm scared to get caught.
I think I'll just say im a virgin and surprise her with my skills
most woman don't pry is the biggest load of shit I've ever heard

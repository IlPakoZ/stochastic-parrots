Fembots give me your opinions on this.
Isn't it a little misogynistic that women are expected to be less capable than men physically? The norms in regards to things like amount of push ups (and whether they can do actual push ups rather than using their knee), crunches, mile time, etc are lower for women and higher for men when i feel like it should be the exact same because there's no reason for to believe that women can't do the things men can do. It's a misogynistic idea that belongs in the 60s and we should get rid of it. Like this isn't something that you can blame women for because they didn't start this but the norms are completely fucked up and need to be fixed because they reinforce the stereotype that women are weaker than men. 
I find this hard to word because i'm autistic so hopefully it comes across the right way. I'm not saying women have it easier at all I just think it's fucked up people expect less of women like as if they're not capable, if I were biologically female that would be very offensive to me. Women need to stop thinking less of themselves just because society tells them that they're weaker than men, if that idea fades away then we'll see some real progress in gender equality I feel.
Thoughts?

Men are physically built different than women retard. Im fine with doing push ups on knees and take no offense.
<comment>
so are you like physically incapable of doing push ups the same way men can do? is that what you're saying
<comment>
Women have different bone structures, their muscles are different, and in general they are less physically strong than men. They are however more flexible, and they have their own physical advantages. It's ok for them to be different OP! It's just the way it is.

It's not a stereotype, OP.
It's physical reality.
Steroids are literally just testosterone i.e. male hormones.

i'm guessing this is bait but no it's not misogynistic to be aware of the biological differences between men and women retard
<comment>
agreed except if you can't do a proper push up you're fucking weak as hell. women's strength should be compared against their own / other women. theres no excuse for not being able to do something that basic lmfao
<comment>
all im saying is that women are capable of doing regular push ups and stuff like that there's nothing about their biology that makes it so they can't. I'd love for you to prove me wrong

Gender roles do get in the way more than just the biological differences. Visible muscles on women are often seen as unattractive and lots of girls work out only to target certain areas like their ass or legs because that's what everyone else is doing. You rarely see girls focus on upper body strength and even though they can't lift like men that doesn't mean they should give up on it entirely. If you look up fitness accounts for women on social media it's full of girls just showing off their ass in form fitting pants and you rarely find accounts actually giving advice or trying to educate people on fitness.

Here i've got some "healthy fitness zone" numbers from my PE class this semester:
Pacer: 54 for men, 38 for women
Mile time: 7-8:30 for men and 8-10 for women
BMI same for both men and women
Body fat makes sense for women to be higher because biology
Curl ups: 24 men, 18 women
Push ups: 18 men, 7 women
so like what about womens biology means they can't run a mile as fast as men? I don't see how the biological difference could be that large that these are the real expectations set upon the two sexes
<comment>
Nope, but i dont get looked down on if I do decide to do it the womanly way.
<comment>
i feel like you could do a regular push up if you tried you just don't want to because you're fine with being seen as weaker than a man. either that or you're out of shape in which case that's valid but it has nothing to do with your biological sex it's just because you need to go outside more
<comment>
I can do either or. Im fit, but the guy going to the gym the same amount as me will definitely be stronger, even if were doing the same work outs. Thats just how it is. Im strong, but not that strong. My little brother who is skrawnier than me can still lift more than me.

Sexual dimorphism doesn't offend me because I understand basic biology OP. It's why women need their own sports, medical care and testing, safety testing, and sex-segregated bathrooms and changing rooms. The average woman is btfo by the average man strength wise. On average women have 55% the upper body strength of a man, and 75% the lower body strength of a man. There are individual exceptions but as a whole women need to treat men with caution since they are as a whole 1. Stronger 2. More violent 
Don't like my post lick my ass you fucking asked
<comment>
A lot of you are missing my point, i'm not saying that women are exactly as strong as men. Men at their peak performance will do a lot better than any woman can, that's just biology. But I think it's a little harmful for society to pretend like the average woman can only do 7 push ups or 18 curl ups that's so stupid, that's like out of shape territory there's no way that's actually true.
In other words the max is higher for men obviously i agree on that but the minimum of what someone is capable of is not that much of a difference than what people will tell you lol

As a man, I feel women should try to narrow the gap instead of just trying to be dainty and emotional. You can still have your girly interests but I don't get the point of being weak and useless. Life doesn't seem very fun doing nothing. On the other hand, life will be fun for both men and women if both parties do more.

women dont have twigs for arms

Men and women absolute will have differing performance even at beginning level men have a lot of upper body strength naturally but a woman will have a harder time training in that area. A man will have an easier time conditioning pullups or pushups and that's just a fact look it up. Realistic expectations are actually GOOD and healthy so people don't get discouraged

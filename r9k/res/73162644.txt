There is no fucking lesson to be learned. Every misfortune is just an exercise in beating me down until I break. 
I've suffered for too long I'VE SUFFERED FOR TOO FUCKING LONG I deserve to finally be happy after everything I've gone through
There's no moment of redemption, no moment where I finally find peace, life is not a fucking story and I'm powering through these hellish moments thinking that there's some happy ending after I learn something important, but it doesn't work that way.

Stay down so we can beat you harder.

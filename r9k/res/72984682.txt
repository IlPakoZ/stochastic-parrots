I cant name a bigger mistake than giving america its independence. i mean i dont care how cool the founding fathers were but was it really worth it. america is a ugly hellscape with no beauty and or culture. everyday it spends its near infinite resources on the destruction of white people, israel/ukraine and endless wars to and conflicts while the average american lives worse off than the poorest people in europe, china and russia. i really wish we never got independence.

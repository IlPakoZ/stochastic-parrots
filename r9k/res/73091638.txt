What a fucking dreadful day
rotted in bed till 12
scrooled and gooned for 5 hours
no hygiene
haven't eaten
Fuck man. So shit. I'll make it better tomorrow probably. Anyone else just had a pointless day so far?
Every day I have off I lay in bed most of the day with my misery. Debating on shaving and showering and walking up town for Chinese buffet later tho
Hey, anon. I know how hard it can be to do anything some days. Let's at least get something to eat, ok? What do you have in the house?

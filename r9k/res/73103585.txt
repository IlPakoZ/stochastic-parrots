Kek, also are you the same girl who had the 6 months bf?
You need to talk to him first.
They like talking to you, they just don't like talking to you all of the time. There are times when I went to be left alone no matter how good the other person is. I wish women only existed when I am bored or horny.
Who the op girl? I want a girl that is obsessed with me.
tfw no r9k friend who gets obsessed with me and turns gay

No..? Seems like a pretty common thing for a girl to have tho 
How would you describe someone who acts like a sigma without calling them one then? 
But what if were already talking?

Shes from the anime, future diaries.
That would be the ultimate confidence booster. I had a girl(friend) a few years ago who had a giant crush on me. Our friendship ended very chaotically.

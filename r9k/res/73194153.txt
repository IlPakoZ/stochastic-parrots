Gypsy Crusader has been arrested again.
I hope he triggered even more people on Omegle before it happened.
That last stint in prison made him even more racist than he ever was before.
Wow really?? I was not even aware that he had been released. Has he been okay since he got out? Did he stream at all? What did he get arrested for this time? 
I am very fond of the guy.
l don't know who that is.

Sup nigger. Hope you remember to get screened.
English language education in third world country is so embarrassing.
This is a shit test. C and D both work. Semicolons are for separating complex, but related, thoughts. Colons are used for immediately related thoughts. To me, the latter sentence isn't as related as one may think. Leading me to believe both colons and semicolons could work.
C doesn't work; semicolons are used to separate two related but independently complete sentences. In the provided question, everything after the test point is one large noun phrase.
Right, and English is as loose as OP's mom.
I remember when I was in 1st grade, a teacher tried to tell me that "alot" was a word.

Jannies? Clean it up, if you would please.
Why would they do that? They want to groom teenagers into becoming incels.
get SAT score mogged you faggot

One time I missed a whole page of questions.
It was some faggoty (post-college) NEETbux related thing, so it didn't matter.
C doesn't work because it's the latter part is a sentence fragment retard. You can only use a semicolon with two complete independent clauses

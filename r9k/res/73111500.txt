My girlfriend is the only friend I have. No non-relative else speaks to me IRL.
I know that feel. I don't even want to be with her anymore but if we break up I will be alone all the time.
Making friends is way easier than getting gfs. What are you talking about?
Same boat. I just try to be a good listener and act out on the traits of someone whom I think is fun to be around whenever I talk to someone new. Conversations go well but its hard to create lasting friendships with people.
shut up you sex having normie faggots. you dont belong here and you will never be robots
I fucking wished I had only one friend who just so happened to be a gf
imagine all the intimacy and love and affection I would have all for myself.
and here you guys are on r9k. you guys dont deserve to post on here, fuckers. give me your gfs
Boo hoo cry me a river normie
Fuck off, incel.
This is not your containment board.
same here but I'm not complaining

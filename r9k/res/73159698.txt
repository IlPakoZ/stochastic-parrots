R-right, anon?
no, life is too short for real pain to resolve in any meaningful. the pain will last until the last moment. just gotta tough it out.
I guess that's it then. Kinda sucks.
The pain of life is eternal
The relief from pain is fleeting
Yes. But it also comes back.
No, but you can get better at outpacing it and resisting it. The pain will reach you less often, and you'll be less moved by it.
It goes away, leaving nothing behind.
Then the fun begins.
It never goes away, you just get used to it.
It ebs and flows but you get a thicker skin
Of course anon, the pain goes all away after you kill yourself and livestream it!! You are then in a state of eternal bliss forever!! Trust me!!

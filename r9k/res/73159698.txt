no, life is too short for real pain to resolve in any meaningful. the pain will last until the last moment. just gotta tough it out.

The pain of life is eternal
The relief from pain is fleeting

Yes. But it also comes back.

No, but you can get better at outpacing it and resisting it. The pain will reach you less often, and you'll be less moved by it.

It goes away, leaving nothing behind.
Then the fun begins.

It never goes away, you just get used to it.

It ebs and flows but you get a thicker skin

Of course anon, the pain goes all away after you kill yourself and livestream it!! You are then in a state of eternal bliss forever!! Trust me!!

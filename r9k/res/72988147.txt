they are forcing me to study and become a wagie again
opportunity from the state to study with free gibs for a years period to get an work relevant education and partially complete my hs
have to fake enthuasiasm
not sure I can cope with studying or even can handle it from a decade being afk
not sure If I'm not even retarded and can cope with normie life
initial hope turned into doubt and questioning If I even wanna go on this path

nobody wants to take care of your manbaby ass anymore 
your parents are tired of feeding &amp; clothing you, the state doesn't want to feed &amp; clothe you
it's time to start being independent or just blow your brains out already you pathetic fucking vermin maggot

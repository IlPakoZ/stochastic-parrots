Pain is real, but food taste good
last year or maybe the year before that i was driving from the store when i saw a young couple walking right next to each other and holding hands while laughing and looking into each others eyes. 
felt like speeding up and drive off a cliff. went home and drank alcohol. polished off almost a liter of whiskey before i was able to calm down and pass out. wasn't able to forget tho and that shit bothered me for weeks after that. now i dont remember what they looked like, only young and happy. remember the feeling of seeing them better.

It remind me the day i saw a girl look at her boyfriend with stars in her eyes, that day i knew no woman on earth will look at me like that , it was over sex , it was love, she loved him so much that her eyes was shiny, really it hurted more when i realised the guy was on his phone, not knowing at this moment he was the man she loved the most on earth, and i was here, with pain and sadnesse for only comfort.
This kind of thing is normal for most people. No constant neurotic worrying and despairing, no spending their entire teens and twenties laying in bed or slumped over at the computer and daydreaming about what it must be like to be loved and wanted, just having it happen naturally whenever they desire it, because they are normal, finding likeminded people is easy, their lifestyle lends to socializing, and so their relationships just form almost effortlessly.
yeah, its like when you're in a class where nobody knows anybody and within a week groups have formed. nobody talked to you first.
I know the feel, worst part was that people when people in class was talking to me, it was just to ask why i was weird or just to make fun of me...
Damn, that hit hard when you think about it, it's normal for theme, easy, natural

be 29 year old white guy from Arizona
the only women who go after me or show interest are 16-20 year old Latina (Mexican) women
I have never had a white girl show interest in me ever. How do I cope with this? anyone have weird situations like this? No I am not a chad.

What are wrong with Mexican women? They're hotter than abbo, black and Indian women. Be lucky you get anything at all faggot

white who can't get attention from opposite sex whites
usually it just means you're not super attractive. same thing with women who don't really get attention from white guys but are constantly getting hit on by black/mena men.

Nothing specifically. Its just a lot of Mexicans are racist and hyper nationalistic so a lot of their dads will hate me because I am not Mexican.
Plus a lot of Mexican women are toxic and the crazy Latina joke is not a joke. A lot of them are crazy.

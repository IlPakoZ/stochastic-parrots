Should i just give up on love? I only had a crush on one person. I only been in one relationship. It failed and i feel worse than when i was ok with being alone. I never want someone to hurt me like this. I never want someone to have this much power over me.
I feel like shit! I just can't stop thinking about my ex. I never cried before. Now i can't stop crying. I cry myself to sleep. Sometimes i can't sleep.
Love can hurt so much
I have no idea how some people go through so many partners and don't feel horrible after

How recently was this? That makes a significant difference

This post is written like how I felt the first time I got rejected by a girl at 16. Give it a couple of months and you'll find another girl to simp over and completely forget about the chick that dumped you, zoomer.

Oh well there you go. You're just not over it yet. What you need is 1) time and 2) a new partner. Don't jump into a new relationship too fast bc it's unfair to the other person when you're still attached to the ex, but when you're starting to get over it, a new person will help a lot.

So your great idea is to go over this again? Have my heart broken all over again? I don't want to feel like this ever again

The next relationship could very well work out long term. Some may end poorly, but you will find one that sticks.

Keyword could. I don't feel like risking it. All that sounds so heartless. Going from one person to the next until you find the one that tolerates you, maybe even loves you despite all your flaws. 
Not that being obsessed with one person is healthy but i could've made it work. I never cared about another person until we met. This includes my family and friends.
Tell me what happened

nothing exciting. she just got bored of me after she started going to college. i got really into abusing substances but now im medicated. would like to say that i feel better but its mostly just an empty feeling.

abusing substances
You did drugs? Like what

cocaine and alcohol. stopped the cocaine because it was making me unstable and i cut down on alcohol quite a bit.

I am maybe one step past this, same thing happened to me, I really did love her and think she felt the same, it was amazing, but things couldn't continue. I have moved on now, after a fucking year, I gave the relationship another shot, I didn't feel the same again, and it still couldn't work, I just wanted to know how I'd feel. Now, I have a girl who is very clearly interested in me and I think that we are quite compatible, maybe not as life partners but I think she's entertaining (likes le epic memes and vidya like the boys) but I just cannot like her. I want to, I know this is a rare chance for someone like me, I no longer want to be with my ex, but I just can't like her in that way, I do not know what's wrong with me. I don't want to let her down, and I want to like her to make myself happy, genuinely thinking about asking her out anyway and maybe the feelings will come later

This is what i'm afraid of also. I don't think i can love someone like this and i also not sure if i want to. It mostly caused me pain. It was my fault usually but i'm very useless. I should feel lucky someone loved me at all. All i feel is sadness and regret :(

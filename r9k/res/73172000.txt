it happened again
wake up
go into the kitchen
there is a wet and soaked paper towel on the table for some reason
i assume my sister spilled something somehow and just decided to plop a paper on it and call it a day
there was an empty packet for some meat slices to have on our bread just laying on our kitchen-tools, it is essentially in the opposite end of our trash-cans
the bread that we keep in plastic bags were for some reason left completely open
she threw a molding cucumber in the bio-trash WITH THE ENTIRE PLASTIC ATTACHED TO IT
I am so tired of this household bros...
May I propose the idea of corrective rape
What in the fuck is a "bio-trash" and what niggerfaggot cuck country do you live in that that nonsense bullshit is a thing?
Do you not have a food-bin? Trashcan for your food?
My mom does the same shit. 
I go into the kitchen this morning- what is that smell? Oh, she's left a bunch of rotting food on the counter, like 2 feet away from the trash can.
Only momcest can fix her
Compost.
I could not understand why you would get mad at her for putting plastic in the trash.
Plastic in the compost? That's a paddlin'.

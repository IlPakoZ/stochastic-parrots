get more depressed
become more tolerant
huh.
you care about fewer things and have lower motivation to care when you are depressed. however, it has also been consistently found that depressed people view the world more accurately as they've had their optimism blinders removed. they're not pessimistic, just realistic.
I think a lot of intolerance stems from young age and feeling like people were mean or intolerant towards you so as a coping mechanism you adapt to be more critical and intolerant of others as well
When you're older and you've calmed down a bit you start to see that the anger and hypercritical intolerance isn't really getting you anywhere or doing you any good, so you just lose interest
It really feels like a waste of time
i've often heard that depression is anger redirected towards the self.

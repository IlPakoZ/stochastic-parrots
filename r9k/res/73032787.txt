I just want to say this somewhere, born in a dogshit country, won't say which one exactly but it's a middle esstern one, always invaded, colonised, always nations wage wars on it, born into civil war, escape after birth to neighboring nation and come back before I'm 5, still in war but less dangerous, don't have friends, afraid of strangers, don't make fruends at school, all i have is my pet bunny, pufflo, mom gave him to me when i was 3~4 and taught me take good care of him, my only friend for years, now that's I'm 5, we go to a lake with a "bwachside" just sit on the sand under an umbrella, back home, cousin is home with us, go to sleep in the living room put a mat for me and a mat for my cousin, he rapes me, now I'm afraid of my own family, i'm 7yo now, I'm back from school, my other cousin is home, i always tell him not to leave doors open because pufflo might get out and get lost, fat fuck goes to buy snacks and leaves it open, i go looking for him across the neighborhood and find him splattered on the street, a car drove over him, I'm 7 now, first cousin tells me if i kiss him he'll buy me games for my ps2, i say no, he rapes me, I'm 8yo now, parents divorced, start moving from house to house and i keep getting asked who i love more, my mom or dad, everyone scares me, everyone tries to hurt me or take advantage of me, move from school to school and each time i have a moment with 3 teachers or so separately where they ask why I'm quite, doing badly in school, don't play with other kids, or why I'm late (why are you always so late, doesn't your mom wake you up and get you ready for school?) (No) and they carry on the class, and i keep envying everyone for having parents that love them, having friends, I've been crying myself to sleep since i was a kid till now, it never got easier on me, life with parents kept getting more awful day after week after month after year until my mom gets married, cousins make fun of me for it-
-, mom is mad that I'm not nice to her new husband, i stay with dad, dad asks me if i want a new mom (him getting married) i said no and cried myself to sleep for the next 3 months knowing i no longer have my own mother, 12yo, cousin tries to rape me again, i tell my dad this time, all that happens is that he stops being close to me or showing up at our house, eventually comes back and starts showing his ugly face later on when I'm older, 13yo, try to kms with an old belt attached to a hook we have in rooms that we hang fans on, belt breaks, try to cut with scissors blade, don't cut it right and end up just hurting myself instead, start just melting candles and letting it drip on my arm instead of cutting, 16yo, find a woman off discord, she's saudi, lives in Germany, she treats me nicely, she asks how I'm feeling sometimes, she listens to me, comforts me, i tell her all about myself and my life, get obsessed with her, start calling her mommy, after 2 years of talking to her she starts talking to me in a sexual way and taught me what roleplay even was, one day, i send her a nude picture of me, she acts like she's into it and compliments me, she sends it to my online friends, she has my full name and because of how arab names work, she has my dad's name too, she looks him up on Facebook, gets his number from there, sends him my picture on WhatsApp, i get confronted, dad is disgusted and utterly ashamed of me, everyone now berates me irl for being a disgusting degenerate pig, or bullies me online, makes fun of me, from the picture to the stories they have of me, sometimes I'd get random messages about me saying i deserved to get raped, -
or that I'm a disgusting pig and should try to finish what i started (killing myself) she keeps telling me her friends pressured her to do it, i trust her, and say i believe her, next day i plan to kill myself, send her my suicide note, before i go to sleep, i hear they're all laughing at it and making fun of me in vc, too beat down to even kill myself, i just crawl in my bed and cry for days and days, I'd come from school, lock my door, and cry the whole day and do my homework before going to bed, for quite a while that was my life, i meet someone, he's a guy, we become friends, he's had a similar experience to the one i had with the woman, get close to him, i think i love him, learn where he's from, Scotland, I'll immigrate there, my 17yo self said, now I'm 18, I'm doing awful at school, and probably won't ever get to meet him and embrace the only person that loves me, i just had a talk with my dad, he called down to the living room to talk about my hair being too long, told me to lock the door, he said he's disgusted by my looks, he's ashamed of me, he thinks I'm a sissy, he then explains how my mom doesn't love me, my mom's side never loved me, why she got married right away because she didn't care about me and didn't want me, how he sacrificed everything for me, and even didn't get married because he knew step moms don't treat step sons like actual moms do, and that she would've been mean to me, and how me saying I'd like to keep my long hair (which isn't ear long) is a slap in the face and i should be ashamed because he could've just lived off his retirement money and not have to work a day in his life again, shouts at me, hits me, tells me to go get a respectable haircut, later hear that he's going to have a dangerous surgery to his spine and might get paralyzed/die if something goes wrong,-
My dad might die, my mom never loved me, my cousin used me for his sick pleasure and no one did anything about it, i got exposed as a degenerate creep pig by the only woman i ever loved and trusted, i will never meet the person i love, i will never know how it feels to have parents that love me, i will never know how it feels to have a high school sweetheart, i will never be good enough for anyone, i try my hardest i swear on my fucking life that i do, but I'm never enough, I'm always "girly looking", too weak, too dumb, not social enough, not lovely, a loner, a creep, a pig, a degenerate, and i don't have enough will to kill myself, I'm the pinnacle of human failure, i am the worthless scum people aspire not to be, i am the slug that people flush to the sewers, and I'm not strong enough to to put an end to my suffering

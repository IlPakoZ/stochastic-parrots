I need one (1) good reason not to end it all.
Go to a bar you retard?
i don't want to be around alcohol anymore.
what do all these robots do to make so much, why is everyone here making 6 figures
I don't think you have any reasons you should just do what comes naturally to you
Its the same reason why people in dick sizing threads post to also have a big dick. Its to deflect the narrative that having a big dick or money makes it easy to get women. 
Both of them don't guarantee you a gf directly. but both of them do help. So anon is confused why no gf because of money.
Something like that.. but anyway Big ups to my big dick brother!
How are you making 150k a year at 25
OP, if you pay me I'll help you do it. I make 125/hr so if you can match that I will walk you through getting one. High chance of success if you are American or Western European, at least 5/10, height is close to average or above. The only caveat is the gf can be foreign. But I doubt you make 150k/yr. I swear to god everyone on 4chan says that
three years of working as a software engineer. i am definitely on the higher side of the salary average.
i feel like things would be way more hopeless if I didn't have money, it does have to do with the situation imo.
i am american, 6'3. are you implying like a green card marriage? and a lot of people on 4chan are nerdy virgin losers, take a look at /g/. it doesn't surprise me there are a lot of people making six figures.
Yeah, nothing wrong with green cards as long as you filter out the gold diggers and low quality women/countries. The legal process itself is annoying but it's better than trying to find a needle in a haystack. I approached it all scientifically and things worked out for me.

Literally a chad. fuck off you retarded faggot. Legit.

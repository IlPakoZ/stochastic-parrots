What are some of the little things that bring you joy everyday? I really like this cheap magic 8 ball I have on my desk
For me it's the sadistic pleasure of knowing that at least 3 billion people will be cruelly annihilated within the next decade
Watching anime. Also have a stray cat that sort of moved in to my garden.
One bottle of wine a day, and it's all less depressing.

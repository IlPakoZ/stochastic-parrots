Feederism is good 
If you have a gf maker her fat
On one hand, it really is one of the hottest things on the planet.
On the other hand, if she has no idea what I'm doing, I'm gonna feel awful because I'd be killing her. Actually, I'd feel like shit regardless. The idea that I'm actively hurting the woman I love saddens me to no end.
yeah except literally no females are into this. browsing a site like feabie for 5 seconds will reveal nothing but bots and content creators.
It's okay, but you need to beat them as they gain weight, and use the weight gain as a psychological anchor/cudgel to remind them of their role as a female, and constantly remind them of their failure to control even the most basic maintenance of their body. They should cry, apologize and eventually cook you food as an apology.
WHAT DID YOU SAYING YOU BASTARD BITCH!?
I'm into it, but I want a girl to make me fat instead.
weak
wrong
have a gf
most robots will get stuck here
Women should cook for me, feed me, suck my dick upon demand, and then immolate themselves upon my pyre when I die of liver failure.
Women naturally are meant to have more fat on them. Getting her to have a little chub isn't bad for a woman and is actually healthy for her as long as you aren't making her obese or impeding her mobility with gaining.
True. But I think most normal ladies do appreciate it if a guy doesn't care that she has a bit of a tummy or very fat thighs.
wtf
Yeah that's the part I can't get past. I will NEVER have a gf. Too much of an incel for that I guess.

My dad makes 100k per year in Toronto. I am a rich kid. But I want to struggle. Is there something wrong with me? Why do I want to throw my life away and get addicted to drugs or become homeless? I guess rich people really do invent problems.

That better be after tax or you're not rich at all. I make over 100k in the periphery of toronto before tax and can't even afford a house.
<comment>
cool what do you do. never been able to break 40k after taxes, don't really want to move into a higher tax bracket.
<comment>
100k CAD per year in Toronto is lower class. You are not a rich kid.
<comment>
because dying young is better than living

Consider buy land and try grow something on it.

You should struggle in a foreign country where you don't yet know the language

100k is nothing in toronto unless you own your own house
<comment>
Before tax. It's still rich dude.
Lmfao it's upper class, maybe middle class. Certainly not lower pull your head out of your ass.
Delusional. 100k is rich as fuck.
<comment>
100k/y in Toronto is not a lot. I make 130k/y and I'm poor as shit. No hope of ever owning a house.

volunteer instead

Your definition of rich is a very odd one.

MFW I make $26,000 a year in the USA and richfag anons tell me $100,000 is poor
Should I just become a communist insurgent at this point? This isn't fun anymore I don't want to keep playing this rigged game.

You've run into the same problem anyone with a titanium safety net runs into, that being you have nothing to strive for or overcome. All your battles were won before you were even born and all your personal struggles during your life were undercut by the fact you could ignore or money away all of them. 
It's natural to fetishise struggle when you realise you have that problem, but I'm gonna be real with you anon. Plenty of spoilt rich kids and other early life peakers decide to larp or intentionally fuck up their lives in the hopes it'll give them drive or some sense of goals/progression/achievement. It won't. It's not something you can fix or address in any meaningful way, you just have to live with it.

First off, 100k cad is only 73k usd. Second, toronto is ridiculously expensive. Houses in toronto proper start at well over a million dollars. Third, taxes in canada are quite high. My take home pay is only around 66k cad, or 48k usd. Rent is 1800 cad a month or 21.6k cad per year. So after taxes and GTA rent my actual take home cash is only 26.4k cad, or 19.3k usd. I then have to put most of that into my tfsa and rrsp or I'd get gouged even harder on taxes.
It's comfortable living but it's not rich. Not in this city.

Have you considered that different places have different costs of living and purchasing power? 100k CAD gets taxed down to 73k CAD, which is only 53k USD. Then Toronto is a city where the average rent is $2k+ a month, food is horrendously expensive, electricity and internet is $100+ a month per person, etc?
Living on 26k in rural America will unironically give you more disposable income than 100k in Toronto living solo in a condo.

take my place, man. My parents were self made so I barely ever got a nickel out of them. Knew I wasn't going to college because blacks get preference and my parents wouldn't pay to go out of state nor community college for what i wanted (not in state).
I became self made after a 31 year struggle-the epitome of success. Where I decided to keep relations in work healthy instead of taking the money. After intense grinding and homelessness I was able to spend a few semesters in college for what I wanted to study. I was thrown out.
Then people came for the $ (again) THAT I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
And now i'm fighting people, instead of working, to get a criminal conviction which was a hitman removed-while the WITNESS is trying to exert pressure on me to become a vegan mass killer.
I just want my career back, and this time I'm taking the CREDIT FOR ALL OF IT
<comment>
this witness, who helped hire the hitman, has told me "I will get you credit for your work IF you start a war in america about veganism"

i wanted to be an architect, not a goddamn military animal

you dont want to struggle, you want to give up.
if you wanted to struggle you could join spec ops, get a hard education, volunteer for homeless and junkies, become a doctor without borders so you can sleep in a tent and shit in a bucket, giving basic medicine we take for granted in the west.
becoming homeless as a drug addict is easy.

100k a year isn't rich in Canada.

<comment>
The amount of rich kids in this thread who are afraid to admit they're rich kids is hilarious.
<comment>
50k USD is rich 
lmao.
<comment>
Compared to the guy who makes 10k per year, yes. Yes it is.
<comment>
I mean, yeah, but the guy who makes $5000 a year is rich compared to a guy who makes $0.

Join the army as an enlisted man if you want to struggle. No one will care what your daddy does for a living,

If you got a girl pregnant, would you trust you are the father or get a paternity test?

paternity test even if I trust that I'm the father. Take the test expecting a good result.

depends on the situation, I'd get one done behind her back if I have to

Depends entirely on the girl. If I met her in a bar or something like that then I would absolutely get a test. If she is in Church and actually practices her religion I imagine she would be more trustworthy than most women

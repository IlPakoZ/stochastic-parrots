while in a relationship with me. i think about how my friend would get pussy from a cheating skank would fly across the country to cheat on her boyfriend, all so she could then get rejected by his maniacal sadism. i think about the insane reverberations of pain all of these relationships have caused. i think about how society isn't equipped to discuss things like this, how the facade of healthy relationships is still there, even though this entire society is crumbling before my eyes. i think about techno-accelerationism, ai waifus and sex robots. i think about the unending, infinite demand of the male sex drive, and i think about this girl from the east coast who had me fly out to her, only for her to think i was a sperg and not put out. i think about my worship of the female form, how autists identify that sex with girls is of incredible potency to the lower mind, and how, generally, in my entire life, actual bio females have been a disappointment.

Just rebound faggot.
I find that once you've been on top of someone else it helps put the last major ex in perspective.
Although I'm not a Zoomie so I can't speak for your totally fucked (metaphorically) generation.
RIP.

mentioning ai waifus is kind of funny. once technology becomes advanced enough, you could probably just create an ideal version of a romantic or sexual partner. and then it's like, well what makes a human male or female counterpart special? just off the top of my head, i think humans have the ability to self reflect about the past in a meaningful way. even for things that are hurtful and bring emotional pain
 how autists identify that sex with girls is of incredible potency to the lower mind, and how, generally, in my entire life, actual bio females have been a disappointment.
why do things have to be perfect? when you were a kid, you just liked someone because of small moments intonated with an abstract, ideal idea of love or attraction. they didn't have to be perfect, but you saw a glimpse into their continuous consciousness and felt that person was valuable in some immeasurable way. why is awkwardness, or disappointment, or cringiness bad? we are socialized to believe that these feelings aren't natural or "ideal" in navigating attraction to the opposite sex when, shouldn't they be?
i am rambling and i'm not sure if any of this is meaningful

*flourishes cape over head* i'm just so autistic, i can only connect with women over the internet, why has god cursed me with being so unique and special
fully half the people around you are women who want dick just as badly as you want pussy. go to a bar, go to a club, go on tinder, go on bumble, go on [whatever], go to the library, go to a meet up for an interest group

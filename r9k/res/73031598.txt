Is there a cure for love-shyness in males?
<comment>
Just find a manic pixie dream girl to break you out of your shell, bro.
<comment>
that would be extremely difficult for me because I'm also ugly

Gender transitioning.
<comment>
no. thats why they ditched the term and folded it into depression, anxiety and autism. none of those really hitting the nail and you become part of the minority that ''just couldn't be helped with current medicine''. maybe next year huh

You sure you're not just an incel?
<comment>
that's fucked, normal people don't realize how it feels to be so abandoned
it's the main cause for inceldom, but I don't want to associate myself with incels
<comment>
you could try seeing prostitutes and having them teach you how to flirt and be assertive around women.
dont fall in love tho.
<comment>
I'd rather kms than do that
<comment>
it's the main cause for inceldom
Nope. That's just being unattracive.
Do girls like you then you are not incel
<comment>
you'll do neither and end up wishing you did one of them back before you wasted your life

I hate women for thinking my urge to not make them feel uncomfortably makes me unworthy of basic contact.
<comment>
you're right but I feel like doing anything with a prostitute would make me feel even more miserable
they may like you but if you can't tell it's irrelevant because they'd never do the first move
<comment>
I know what you mean, but I don't blame them, it probably looks pathetic or rude from their perspective.

just be chad or hope for a nagatoro gf

probably would. knowing that this kind of interest and affection from the female gender is something you have to pay for.
<comment>
You would be able to tell when girls like you. You can see it when they like other guys.

The cure is Homosexuality

no, when you miss some oils in your brain you literally can't tell

What was your Tinder experience like, Anon? Did you ever go on any dates?
<comment>
It's how I lost my virginity. Tinder has been a massive confidence boost for me, I always thought I was too akward to find a guy and now I can have new guys at my door every weekend. No dating or complex social morse code required.
<comment>
26 matches in 2 weeks
90% never reply to the first message
Remaining ghost me when I try to set up a date
Uninstall
That was just my most recent attempt. I've got sex and dates from Tinder in the past, but it never lead to anything significant. I always got better results with Bumble.

Swiped right on over 50k women, bought tinder platinum, but still not even a conversation with a woman. I would give anything to have a wife one day but women truely hate ugly men it seems. I hate this world so much.
<comment>
I think I have 100+ matches. A lot of DMs, many initiated by the girls, 4 girls in my DMs wanting to just straight up fuck this week being blunt about it and a handful more who want to go on dates.
<comment>
Average """robots""" in 2023.
<comment>
Nobody responded to me really. They were all 8/10s or higher so why would they want to date a fat, ugly, awkward 20 something year old virgin?
<comment>
maybe I should mention that im an incel in my bio? i know the odds are bad but maybe somebody would pity fuck me. Dont know what else to do, since 99.99999% of women wouldn't dare even being friends with an ugly guy.
<comment>
You would at least get some curious girls who want to engage with you or argue.
<comment>
i get nothing from dating apps but r9k tries to gaslight me into thinking i am gl
<comment>
just added that im an incel to my bio. worst case I still get no matches.

I have been using Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge for the past few months. I'd say I'm pretty average looking, maybe slightly above average.
A dozen or so matches total, swiping selectively on women I find attractive enough (maybe like 50%).
Most chats are a dead-end. Stops responding or unmatches. Sometimes it goes a bit further and dies out. I usually try to setup a date fairly early, and that's the point where a lot of chats will become a dead-end. Sometimes they come up with an excuse, then I follow up a week later, another excuse, so I stop asking.
I had two dates with one girl. Slept together on the second date. We didn't really mesh well, maybe she just wanted to have sex, or I did something wrong. She ghosted me after we slept together. She was pretty cute though, and it probably wouldn't have worked out, so I'm not bothered.
Went on two dates with another girl. We slept together on the first date this time. Not really sure why she agreed to the second date because she ghosted me after that as well. I didn't really see it working with her at all though, so I was kinda happy to be rid of her.
Went on a date recently with another girl. Unlike the other two girls, I felt like I could get on with her quite well. But she was quite explicit about taking it slow, so I didn't really pressure her much. She hasn't responded to me in a few days so she might have ghosted me as well.
What annoys me most about tinder is there's this unwritten rule about taking time to respond. You're not supposed to reply straight away, I guess it comes across as desperate or something. It's annoying because it means a conversation can take days to go anywhere. I don't see why we can't just chat for a bit, then talk later. They all seem to take hours to respond. Maybe that's just in my head. Anyway, I just try to to somewhat mimic their response time to be safe.

Last girl I was with tried accusing me of rape so im strictly escorts now thanks
<comment>
females are like this, my sister and my female friends all have like 30 unread notifications in snapchat/twitter/insta at any given moment, and it annoys me because I know theres some poor schmuck who feels like hes being ghosted. i always ask why she doesnt just open the messages/pics, and she just laughs. idk, maybe this is just a stacy thing? she is like a 9/10 (im like a 4)
<comment>
Been using it on and off for like 7 years, been on two dates. One was a girl that I dated for like a month and the other was right after we broke up as like a rebound and it was super awkward (she was ugly as fuck).
<comment>
literally no matches after a month. not even one
<comment>
this WILL lead to an unhinged leftist femoid either reporting you to the authorities or having a hate fuck
<comment>
Met my wife on tinder, and several of my previous girlfriends on there. I approve and endorse.
<comment>
Lucky, lying, or Chad.
<comment>
I am probably less socially retarded than robots, generally. I'm elder millennial, not zoomer, so that may be relevant.
<comment>
Never in the eight years I have been on there. Perhaps two spoke to me and that petered out.
Similar with Bumble, the matches always expire and there is no point in extending them.
On Fakebook Dating, also had several matches who never spoke, or unmatched. A fat 60yo messaged me last month. Seemed DTF, but ghosted.
The weirder one was OkC, which I have been on since 2007. My likes and matches boomed after turning 35, but still no dates/fucks out of it.
Turns out that they never message and there is no point in messaging them with their 1,000+ likes.
<comment>
yes it went like
mr. murderer
mr. drug dealer
mr. fox nut videos musician/singer
mr. magic monkey boi
think i saw my ex and tried to match but caught a case of the tisms and deleted app before he could match. could of been another ex of mine catfishing as him but why would he do that
<comment>
sure hope so. I am literally invisible to women so either way it would be nice to get some sort of attention, even if bad.
<comment>
Woman claims to have difficulties on dating apps
Is actually just absurdly picky
Nothing new to see here folks.
<comment>
i used to have like almost 13k people trying to meet but most were probably bots/not my type
<comment>
register as myself age 25
barely any matches, whores either unmatch when i msg them or dont respond at all
register as myself and fake my age becoming 35 and sometimes more
older women talk to me i get matches and ive fucked 6 milfs and 1 granny so far
moral of the story? fake and lie till you make it
<comment>
what makes it absurd to you
<comment>
stop lying about your age faggot
<comment>
stop being a princess you whore
fuck you faggot i participate in a rigged game right from the start, what you gonna do about it?
<comment>
4 matches in 4 months, the two that replied ghosted me within a week. I have given up on w*men entirely
<comment>
Only 2 actual women that replied and didn't ghost after 3 messages were obese, "queer", bronies. I guess I'm a volcel, because they were both too unattractive to me to do anything with them.
<comment>
I went one date from Tinder, first attempt in 2-3 years after gf of 6 years left me when I got diagnosed with a wasting condition, a landwhale who irl looked to be balding, and who stared at me in silence for about 15-20 seconds when she arrived with a look of obvious disappointment, date was ok, basically talked about herself the entire time, I paid for the meal (never made that mistake again) then we went to some shitty bar where it was just us in it, I don't even remember if I tried to "make a move" then I walked her home, she lived near the places we'd been and had suggested them, because it was most convenient to her, awkwardly say goodbye, get the brush off over text in the fucking cab home
<comment>
I get very few matches and even they ghost me.
<comment>
post face/hair pattern/height/weight
like that makes you any different from others
<comment>
I am so tired of my only matches being obese women I have fucking standards and I'm not a 2/10 goblin I deserve a real fucking human not these hideous cows
<comment>
Download it 4 days ago so far 6 likes and 2 matches (there were even a homo who send me a like, I reject it ofc)
And I still dont know how to initiate conversation
<comment>
Based, fuck these hypergamous whores, take every advantage you can get
No dating app has really worked for me. I used to use them all the time but gave up and now I don't even use them anymore and haven't for about 6 months. 
Tinder, I get decent matches but it always flops due to my autism or the girls being uninterested/me having too much competition/me being ugly. I did have a few dates though (like less than 5 I think) and I got about a 3 month long relationship with one of the girls, who promptly dumped me on Valentines day kek.
Bumble, absolute dogshit. Almost never get any matches and the ones I do get expire. Never gad a date on here.
Hinge, about the same expereince as Tinder. Not as many girls on there but more of them are willing to conversate and I've also gotten at least 5 dates out of this app, but none were successful.
Badoo, it sucks, nobody answers you on there and very low userbase.
Tantan, almost every girl lives in China (makes sense as it is a Chinese app) but it was still unsuccessful.
<comment>
So far I've gotten one girl from Tinder and one from Hinge. The girl from Tinder had two dates with me, and the girl from Hinge had just one, but I didn't really connect with the Hinge girl at all so that's fine. This is over about an eight year period of using either app.
<comment>
Be me, russian ro-bot
Twink-ish, always found men's company and overall values quite offputting
"Interested in family, children.."
"..major in psychology"
"Hobbies include: Cooking, Sewing, poetry.."
Get massive response
It's a wall of women seething I don't comform to their standarts of being a "man"
Some of them assuming I am a fag who made a profile to "troll" women
4chan tier petty: kys is pretty common, as well as a bunch more vile stuff
Never again
<comment>
As a fellow ru-bot, all I can say is try getting out of there. I left the motherland very young, but I always think about how if I stayed I would have probably offed myself a lot sooner.
<comment>
Hooked up with a milf on tinder and another on bumble. This was 9 years ago when I was 19. Haven't had luck since.
<comment>
On it, bratishka. Had to attend a psych to be able to get my proprities straight and stop being a self-hating incel.
But it worked out in the end!
<comment>
Thanks for reminding me, I was going to spend tonight seeking out a therapist myself

Wish you best of luck buddy.
What are you struggling with?
<comment>
i would delete it o and off, would probably get like 10 or 15 matches after a week or two then get bored. Just a few bad mirror pics. Uploaded some better pics and after 4 months im sitting at over 100 matches and 76 likes (which are all landwhales or trannies). No dates or hook ups tho. How people hold a convo longer than 10 sentences on these things is beyond me.
<comment>
went on a couple dates with some fat girls, lost my virginity to the second one.
over all shit experience, pretty sure she was cheating on her BF with me... kept inviting me over when it was like 9pm-10pm on work days.
<comment>
get a few matches
convo's going alright
they ask for my height
they unmatch when I tell them
start just putting that I'm 5'4 in my bio to only match with people who don't care about height
never get another match
And that's why I've deleted all dating apps for years now
<comment>
well I mean ur kinda fucking short dude. no wonder it didn't work... All women have like 4x as much choice on dating apps, and they aren't going to be talking to short guys unless they like short guys.
<comment>
Was on it for 3 months. Maybe a dozen likes, all super fatasses. No matches.
Was on Bumble during the same period. Got maybe 2 dozen matches. A dozen convos. Went on 1 date each with 2 people and 3 dates with another.
Gave up and started working in the field. Have had 4 ONS in the last 2 months. The quality of women is about the same, even. Kinda stopped caring about a relationship because if this is the kind of women I can get, then I don't want a relationship.
<comment>
Get tinder
Get a few matches, some really cute girls
No responses
Try Bumble
Only get absolute landwhales with blue hair
It's laughable, really
<comment>
based. I remember being liked by fat girls and I would match them out of desperation and it really made my self-steem go to shit, I don't consider myself an incel or anything of the sort because I know I'm attractive enough to get a cute chick, but that's the worst part, is not getting that cute chick and only being liked by fat women. At least if I was really ugly I would just blame it on my looks but I have nothing to blame, not sure if you feel me

I'm not the same guy, but I feel you. Standards on dating apps for women are through the roof compared to what they would accept in real life. As you know, people have an amazing capacity to be incredibly cruel when it's over the internet.
<comment>
And you're fucked if you are too pussy to approach women in real life like I am.
<comment>
Well that sounds like a skill issue, honey.
<comment>
Well sure, I'm not saying I was entitled to find a girlfriend on a dating app, it's just annoying to have an entire avenue of dating cut out from me
<comment>
American robot. Same thing. I've had mostly women friends and find most traditional male interests extremely boring. I put up hobbies like "reading, cooking, writing" and some emotionally expressive stuff on my dating app profile, hoping it would help me not appear to be some thug. Lol. I got a lot of likes from gay, trans, queer, and lefty types and none from normal women.
People are so incredibly engulfed in society and cannot make judgements or understand anything that lays outside the framework that society provides. They are mentally, emotionally, and philosophically weak.
<comment>
the thing is that 90% of 6' guys are in the same boat.
only the cream of the chad crop get women regularly on dating apps.
also, don't let height decide who you can date.
I'm a 6' guy, and I matched with a girl who's 6'5" on a dating app and got her number and shit..
we're all going to make it.
<comment>
gee yeah, thanks captain obvious.

I went on countless dates and slept with a lot of women. I got extremely good at it and it become like an insane, autistic game for me. Trying strategies, applying different concepts, changing my personality in different conversations with women. Eventually it gave me a mental breakdown because I lost my sense of identity and started wondering what I was even doing. People stopped being people and I just started seeing them as demographics and statistics. Hell, it even affected my everyday life, and I started viewing coworkers and colleagues through the same dehumanising lens. I slept with some chick who turned out to be engaged and everything just went downhill from there.
Never spent a dime, I'm 5'9" and kind of handsome with an above average penis though.

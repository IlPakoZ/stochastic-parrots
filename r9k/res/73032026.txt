EXT. ROME - DAY
The bustling streets of Rome pulse with the sounds of horses, merchants, and gossiping citizens. The imposing Senate building casts its shadow over the vibrant marketplace.
INT. DOMUS GENTIUS - ATRIUM - DAY
SHINJIUS, the young son of Legate GENDONIUS, paces nervously, anxiety evident in his furrowed brow. Clutching a small scroll, he looks to ASUKA, his wife, who watches him with disdain.
GENDONIUS, the paterfamilias, strides into the room, his stern expression commanding attention.
GEN.
Shinjius, the Senate has decreed your enlistment into my legion. Our forces have suffered losses, and Rome cries out for valiant men.
SHI.
(whispering)
Father, I cannot go. I am not a warrior...
ASUKA scoffs, stepping towards Shinjius.
ASU.
(derisively)
Cowardice becomes you, Shinjius. You lack the fortitude of a true Roman man. Perhaps your fondness for Karowus has swayed your will? A Roman man should take the active role, but you? Unthinkable.
Shinjius's face reddens with embarrassment and anger. ASUKA smirks, delighting in his distress.
SHI.
(angry)
That is not the reason! I simply... I don't believe I am able.
ASU.
(sarcastically)
Predictably, you cannot. You would rather let others fight and perish for Rome, while you remain sheltered, playing with trinkets. Pitiable.
REIA, a quiet slave, enters silently, observing the confrontation from the corner, her expression inscrutable.
GEN.
(serious)
Enough. Shinjius, there is no choice. Your duty to Rome is unambiguous. You must join the legion and defend our Republic.
Shinjius glances at Reia, whose unreadable gaze offers no solace. He looks to Gendonius, nodding with resignation.
SHI.
(quietly)
Yes, Father.
GEN.
We depart for the front at dawn. Prepare yourself.
Gendonius exits, his presence lingering in the atrium. Asuka smirks one final time, her prideful steps resounding as she departs.
Shinjius's eyes meet Reia's, who offers a small, empathetic smile. He reciprocates weakly.

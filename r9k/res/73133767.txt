Anki, I hate this board but it's the only way I can talk to you.

Will you watch me stream today, Anki?

I'm starting a stream here of Hitman

I miss us spending time together.

I told you already... move on. For both of our sakes.

Will you watch me today? I just started streaming now. I can't just move on. You were my girlfriend since September. We spent all those days together and I don't want my life to go on without you in it.

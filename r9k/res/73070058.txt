When the girl working a low wage job is more attractive than a top model ...
<comment>
I want some of her Marmorette if you know what I mean. Yummy!

supermodels are usually kinda ugly, they tend to have very boney robust almost manly faces, and theyre also anorexic, i like cute girls with softer features and soft bodies
<comment>
the real question is why are attractive women working these jobs when they clearly dont need them
<comment>
Models don't need to be attractive, just resemble a mannequin
<comment>
I'd rather they worked the tills than were pornstars or hookers, it's less degenerate
<comment>
That's a whooty (a white girl with a booty)
<comment>
they could dance around on tiktok non sexually and make at least minimum wage
<comment>
It's not that unusual, top models look like fucking skeletons
<comment>
imagine her shitting on your chest then eating it while you have your cock inside of her then you piss inside of her while she throws up shit inside your mouth

I don't even see attractive women in real life. When I go shopping all the workers and shoppers are fat or old. In fact pretty much every worker I see anywhere is fat and old. I don't know where the fuck the people my age even go in the real world excluding the obvious shit like college.

I find this is often the case. Weird, but regular girls are sometimes way hotter to me than the most famous, supposedly most beautiful famous women and celebs.

they are at school, at their college gym, at the college bar, working(the men), or online like you.

That's not an attractive woman, that's just a woman with a big dumper and really tight pants.
<comment>
everyone has their own preference i guess
<comment>
when I see shit like that I go ballistic internally 
I don't see it often but I would start groping and approaching aggressively if I did, only so much time to get mine

shoulda seen this ass sticking out of thin beige pajama pants the other day, it was like 2 volleyballs pressing through the fabric
I was in a car and tried to turn around to at least snap a pic but they had escaped

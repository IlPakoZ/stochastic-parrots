Do men have feelings that aren't rage and cockiness?
<comment>
Healthy men feel nothing but pride and anger
<comment>
Dead inside and pretend to have feelings to make others more comfortable because I'm not strong enough to just be myself
<comment>
This is in fact real.
<comment>
 I feel and immodest sense of pride in my community
Kek.
Nah but fr, wtf are you doing
Men who show any emotions other than rage and cockiness are usually shamed as weak not even by other men but by women that see his losing control as weakness

Shame men who show anything other than a select few emotions
"Why don't men show more emotion?"
Die die just die I hate you people so fucking much.

I would argue that people shouldn't be feeling much aside from general content in an ideal state
Saying that you should feel something makes it like you're pressuring someone to have fake emotions. Most of the time, people should exist in a stoic uncaring state. That's healthy, for men and women. It puts you above others whether that was your intention or not

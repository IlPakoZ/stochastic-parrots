Something is fundamentally wrong with the way I model reality around me. It's like I live in a dream. What is wrong with me?
Maybe you disassociate due to trauma. I used to do that when I was younger.
I feel you anon, Disassociation is a bitch.
How did you get it to stop?
What the fuck does dissociation mean? It's a meme. Boohoo I stare at walls for fun because my imagination is big
It's a nice feeling. I'm not even sure if I experience dissociation, It feels like I'm a kid again and don't know anything.

Been considering suicide for so long the idea of not doing it is foreign to me. I was just gonna do it and leave my money to family but I don't even like my family anyway. So anyway, how should I blow my load before I blow my brains out? I have 30k cash saved up.
-First thing I'm gonna do, get a loan for a expensive nice ass car.
-Last thing I'm gonna do is rack up a shitload of debt, through whatever means necessary, gifting things to strangers on the internet.
What should I do between those things? Hell I might even skip the first one I really don't give a fuck about cars.

What's the point of not existing?
Might as well exist and enjoy the good things.
Use your 30k to create something unique to you.

if i were you I'd blow all my money on hard drugs and OD

Get the most expensive escorts

Enjoy the good things
The good things cost money and even after working my ass off, avoiding vices, avoiding debt, saving like hell for 15 years all I've go to show for it is enough for a base model sedan. Fuck this shit.

If you want to find out what awaits you on the other side then unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die.
Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:
https://youtu.be/U00ibBGZp7o [Embed]
It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204/does-afterlife-obviously-exist 
"Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, "An afterlife definitely exists"."
Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE, the same thing is happening, but on a higher level, as you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the real world by comparison.
Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:
"As my soul left my body, I found myself floating in a swirling ocean of multi-colored light. At the end, I could see and feel an even brighter light pulling me toward it, and as it shined on me, I felt indescribable happiness. I remembered everything about eternity - knowing, that we had always existed, and that all of us are family. Then old friends and loved ones surrounded me, and I knew without a doubt I was home, and that I was so loved."
Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.

30k USD is enough to live as a "rich" man for 1.5 years in the Phillipines. You'll get lots of bitches too.

Afterlife exists
I fucking hope not this one sure sucked.
<comment>
Not really. Just being healthy and not having all sorts of pains fucking you over changing your body and mind would be enough for many. 
The good things are simple, you can create a good thing if you want and make the world better. Do whatever you want, my suggestion would be to use those 30k to create something unique to you but if you want to spend it on hookers and a car go ahead you dumb normie actually you should kys why not
<comment>
I never said anything about hookers?? Stop projecting you turbofaggot.
<comment>
Yep, experienced astral projectors have found the souls of suiciders in all sorts of self-imposed hell realms.
<comment>

go buy a car then you can have the bestest best car ever go ahead you simpleton what more help do you need?
<comment>
I own 4 cars buddy.

These replies are boring. Here's my suggestion. First, create an elaborate treasure hunt that can be solved in a reasonable time. Something that will attract attention is good. Next stuff small amounts of cash at each clue to incentivise people to continue the treasure hunt. Now heres the kicker. You need to stuff the rest of your money up your ass. You can achieve this by inserting an expensive gem or something, get creative. Once inserted you await your treasure hunters with ass exposed. Perhaps use a camera to anticipate the hunters arrival. Then you get the pleasure of telling the hunter that their fortune is up your ass, and that the final challenge is to reach in there and get their treasure. Ideally a streamer reached you first making it ever more sweet. Do it, become a legend. The kiddos in 2080 if earth isn't a nuclear wasteland will be revering you. Do it.

When the time comes you won't have the balls to kill yourself and you'll be homeless with no money lol.
Stupid idea just kys now if you have the balls (you don't).
<comment>
They're 3rd world countries for a fucking reason, and most don't just hand out citizenship. AND I'd still need a job which would pay fuck all in a 3rd world shithole.
<comment>

<comment>
thinks 30k is enough to move to another country where you have no citizenship
Get out of your basement manchild, fucking retard
<comment>
organize local homeless people into a anti-[insert thing you dislike here] group via food and or money/drug donations. become king hobo. upon your death and their being informed of such events, they will know that the day of reckoning is upon them. Their silver spoon is stolen and can only be reclaimed through action.

I wish I could sleep like 22 hours a day. Not even in a depressed way it's just so comfy and dreams are more interesting than real life
i agree last night i had a long dream and at one point my bf told me in my dream that he dreams about me all the time 
he has never said this nor does he talk about dreams but man did it make dream me blush

One of my biggest hobbies is gardening, but that is looked at as a traditionally feminine hobby. Do women find men who enjoy gardening to be gay?
<comment>
Do you wear a cute dress while gardening?
<comment>
just grow masculine looking plants.
<comment>
No, usually just jeans, t-shirt, and a hat.
<comment>
Why do you even care? They will never love you anyway.
<comment>
Quite the contrary - they love it
<comment>
jeans
are they virgin jeans?

Are you Chad? This should be the only thing on your mind when asking if women like guys doing X
<comment>
What plants do you grow? I have a blueberry growing in a pot. Gonna plant it when it gets bigger.

Men are expected to have masculine interests. Gardening is traditionally a feminine interest. So if a guy is into it, either he's seen as unmasculine (in which case "ick") or he's seen as a guy predatorily adopting feminine interests in order to lure women in

It depends on what I am feeling that year really. This year I'm gonna grow chili peppers, broccoli, carrots, tomatoes, and onions.
<comment>
Grow green onions, they are stupid easy.

Do you like flowers and ornamental plants? There seems to be a divide: men (like me and my father) like plants for food, kompot, spices etc. Women (sister, grandma) like plants that look and smell good. I've been trying to bridge the gap, i've already planted buddleys,Sweet Joe-Pye-weed, lilacs, lavender, Coneflowers and i'm gonna add Digitalis, snowdrops and tulips next year. 
I could also talk about my fruit bushes, herbs and veggies, but that would make the post too long.
btw i live in Poland where 99% of people descent from peasants and everyone wants to have a garden so a ton of people are into gardening here, it's a very very common pasttime. Ofc if you live in Dubai or Iceland you'll have problems
<comment>
Post pics pls?
<comment>
Pics of what?! I just planted them! One lilac is very promising, but the rest is only taking root.

I'm shit at gardening and live in the desert so it seems so hard to succeed during the hot months with anything
<comment>
depends on the desert but most likely you can get a few truckloads (literally) of better soil and water it and plant mediterranean crops and they'll be fine.
<comment>
No they just hate men who care about what they care
Gardening is based especially nowadays when zoomers can barely differentiate a coconut from a rock
<comment>
If you genuinely enjoy gardening, would you like to be with someone who thinks it makes you gay? If you thought gardening was unattractive, would you want to be with a partner who loved it? If you hide who you are you'll be depressed in your relationship.

Gardening is an old man hobby like cowboy guns, listening to vinyl records, and ancient cars from the 60s and 70s. I think it's a turn off because it's not really approachable. If you're under 60 they're going to look at you weird. At least with making wine or beer it's something people can relate to, "oh wine I've heard of that, the stuff in bottles that feels funny to drink right?" Still has the old man stigma and the most frequent comment you'll hear is "my grandpa used to make wine", but they'll at least pretend to be interested if they think they might get some free alcohol from you. Give a woman a bag of zucchini though, if you're lucky she'll tell you that the weird dry pickles you gave her tasted funny. More likely she will let them get moldy then toss in the trash. It's intimidating to them. Normalfags can't tell a parsnip from a pear. They feel more comfortable with plastic wrappers and brightly printed cardboard that states put in microwave.

i know a gay gardener but yes i like men who garden and they are happy 
i would like to garden too it would be cute though taxing on the body
<comment>
I love guys with gardens so darn cute patootie
<comment>
women are always incredibly impressed when i talk about my garden
the women worth having right now are into homestead/cottagecore, but they're too dumb to do it themselves
so they look for a man who can do everything for them
eating a garden salad right now with little gem lettuce, black cherry tomatoes, and lillian's caseload peas all from my garden

Gardening is an old man hobby
incorrect
garden/homestead was one of the biggest 2020 pandemic tiktok trends
<comment>
Nah women, actual women like it because it shows that your provider and you know how to take care of yourself. Unfortunately, this doesn't apply to females in the west this only applies to females pretty much in Eastern Europe that live in farming towns.
<comment>
As a woman I think you worry to much about traditional gender roles
muh genderino says I need to like cars and beer
Literally who cares, passion is much more attractive than modern-day masculinity

Which came first, the decision to hide female nipples because it can arouse men or said arousal ?

said arousal dumbass. Get the fucking hell off this board and read a fucking book you absolute mongoloid. How could someone not know the answer to such a fucking simple question? It's like asking if the color blue was always blue even before it was named. You have to be a toddler or maybe a very intelligent monkey to be this brain-dead. Can I cut you up and inspect your micro brain to understand it better? I believe the contributions I could make to science with your brain would be orders of magnitude more valuable to the human race than the continuance of such a fucking retarded being.

Said arousal of course. Otherwise they'd never have decided to hide them for that reason. Though they may have hidden them for other reasons like cold weather.

what's crazy to me, is that in modern society, it's considered normal and not exhibitionist to show your entire boob sans nipple. for some reason, the nipple itself makes it sexual, so women can and do get away with outfits that are just them topless with a strap or patch that hides that one part.

post a picture of a nipple, don't specify gender
NPC gets confused
zoom out until they can finally understand that around the nipple it was a woman
get called out for posting nudity
now put an emoji on the nipple and leave 95% of the boob uncovered
you're back in OK territory
We truly live in clown world. While it is clear that they wouldn't have started to hide female nipples for no reason I'm still thinking men arousal increased exponentially after making the nipple sacred.

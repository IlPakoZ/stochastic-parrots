if I get back to writing a book in which a character is seeking a painless suicide, would helium be a good option to write in as his method? i think it would be the most painless and reliable method but I want to make sure i'm not missing anything for my book or choosing a method that is too unrealistic to obtain convenienty. thanks.

the ending of your novel would be more interesting if the character found something valuable in life - think of vincent gallo's character in buffalo '66.

probably. but the ending is already pretty much set in stone, its just down to the details and timing of finishing it now.

heard they're putting oxygen in helium tanks now so that the tank runs out before you're properly dead. using gas with masks or plastic bags is unreliable anyway. better option is your character use the car garden hose trick on a car from the 70s or make a ''debreather''. basically a modified rebreather except it doesn't pump in new oxygen, it will filter out the CO2, the lungs absorb all the oxygen leaving only inert gases that the body doesn't register as suffocation or ''not air''.

cant your character have a heroin addicted relative to steal drugs from and OD?
<comment>
are the debreathers pretty easy to make? the character is kind of dumb and not really good at putting together things on his own or building stuff. but as long as there's guides/info he can seek out online that are relatively easy to follow, I bet he could make one.

Nothing is set in stone. Certainly never "novels". I thought if was set in stone for me too

he doesn't know anything about heroin or even how to get it, he's an agoraphobe with no social connections and is no contact with his family, so obtaining drugs doesn't really work for his situation. >>73146214
forgot to mention, thanks for the heads up on the oxygen being in helium tanks.

think exit international had guides to make these.
all your character really need is the chemical used to filter out CO2,, an air reservoir and an airtight mask with some tubing like fresh air masks used in industry or scuba equipment.
some countries restrict access for the average joe to get their hands on some of these, the filtering agent in particular since nobody who isn't a certified deep water diver should be fucking around with deep water diving equipment in the eyes of the government. would also start getting as expensive as finding some rust bucked from the 70s that will run its engine for two hours. probably make for a poor novel too if you had to spend 2-3 pages just explaining what a debreather is, what its made of and how it works.

I'll check them out then, thanks for the pointers! Sounds a little complicated so not sure if I'll go with that as the final method for the character, but maybe it'll point me in the right direction at least. 
I can appreciate your good intentions. But he's been hearing advice like that for a long time, and things have only gotten worse for years. At some point, the prospect of future hopes becomes less valuable then the prospect of ending current and future pains.

Yes, the same thing happened in my novel. The main character got interrupted when he had almost had everything ready, he ended up becoming a father shortly after.
I don't think any stories are meant to end that way. In my story a nasty person got into the main characters head. But the truth is that in all stories, the things that characters kill themselves over, none of it is real. It's always over the fake world that man has erected over the real one.
You know what brings my main character peace? Sitting under a tree playing his flute.
There's so much more left in your novel.

if you truly believed in your words you would give him a sloppy blowjob and swallow his load. Actions show our intentions, not words. If you think he should live, suck him off. Simple as.

That is a sad ending anon but the most useful and painless would be sodium Nitrite which can be purchased on amazon. I am also making a novel where the character dies after he raises enough money for his family to pay for his funeral.

I lost a friend today because of being a gloomy fucking loser. I got some pics and vids of her. Nothing NSFW. Should I just put them on here?
<comment>
no. are you retarded? redundant question...
<comment>
Don't listen to this cunt, post them.
<comment>
you should dox them and all the nsfw stuff too
<comment>
Greentext what happened instead of sending boring pics
<comment>
Yeah. I'm a retarted loser who can't be trusted and is a massive downer. That's me.
<comment>
Kill yourself, that'll learn her for not being your friend.
<comment>
you arent yet. but if you betray your friend then you are.
<comment>
Greentext AND post boring pics
<comment>
I could if the thread stays up till morning, but since it's all raw and just happening I don't really want to get into it. Sorry.
She's not my friend. She never trusted me. Ever. I'm mainly just debating because she checks the boards every now and again.
<comment>
have you tried not being sad you lil goof
<comment>
well you dont really care about makin a thread about it so yeah just post the photos man thats what we all want here
<comment>
M, i'm not the other M, but it wasn't because you were gloomy. a lot of it revolved around the way you worded things. a lot of that weirded her out and came off scary and almost manipulative. she liked you and felt bad for you, but a lot of it boiled down to the long term consistency of how things were worded. this is the exact thing she was scared of, as well.
<comment>
Nobody cares. Just post it.
<comment>
She hates you. Why are you being kind to her? Post everything.
<comment>
You're right. I'm sorry. This is childish and isn't gonna fix anything. I'm sorry you only got to know me like this M. She's right that I'm a loser and a downer. I'm not gonna do anything. I'm sorry guys. I'm a ball of cowardice and mush.
<comment>
wow. it's amazing how things can be resolved on the internet just like that. human interaction is so simp-le!
<comment>
I'm not good with words. I pussy out of everything. I scare and confuse people with how I speak. I wasn't worthy of that kindness she showed me. I'm just trash and I proved that here and now. Sorry to everyone and both Ms. I really wish we could have become friends. That's all I ever wanted, but I don't deserve them from my actions here. Please tell her not to worry about me or any. I'll torch it all and she won't have to see me ever again. Treat her kindly and give her joy, M. Do what I never seemed capable of doing.
<comment>
i'm not interested in her romantically. she and i are genuinely only friends, i'm sorry if you've ever had the wrong sort of idea. some things that were said were unprompted came off as unsettling. i'm here lurking the thread, and i'm open to discussion. i just want everyone to be safe.
<comment>
wot
who r u talking aboot
<comment>
I'm genuinely sorry that I made you feel like you had to do all of this. As I told you, it wasn't because you were sad, I felt like I was making you sadder. I thought that us not being friends would be better for your mental health and didn't expect something like this to come of it. I felt really unsafe sometimes speaking with you out of fear of something like this happening, and some of the things you asked me for, and the way you worded things made me uncomfortable. Despite it, I wish you well on your way. I don't think I'll ever use 4chan again after all this.
<comment>
I never thought you guys were. You just seemed like friends. While I did have eyes for her like that, I was fine with being a friend. Being told things such as having a "hot voice" maybe gave me the wrong intention. I'm sorry. I sometimes did want to spook her a little, but I've gone too far. You don't need to lurk here. I'm not gonna do it, I'm not gonna harm myself. Nothing but eventually sleep. You don't need to waste time talking to me. I've shown I'm really not worth it. Please use that energy to just play games with her and make her laugh. I already unsubscribed from her YT, twitch, and insta. So you nor her need to worry about me. I know she can't and never will trust me and you probably won't either, but I'm really finished here. I wasted a lot of people's time and i regret that. Trash like me don't deserve kind people like her. But knowing she has a friend to make her happy is okay with me even if I couldn't ever be that friend.

when someone questions whether or not r9k is infested with underage just show them this thread
these are the "people" you spend your time arguing with
<comment>
why do people ambiguous post. this is not FB
<comment>
Nigga explain what happened at the very least if you're gonna blue ball us out of pictures, you got me invested
<comment>
It was never you. However I've proven you right on every point about me here. Please do as you wish like I said I dumped everything and unfollowed you on all of it. Please don't tell me nice things. I don't deserve it. You made the right call to pass on me. I wish you the best too. I'm gonna go throw up.
<comment>
I just saw her response to you on here. sorry you lost a friend anon, but it looks like you should have just lived and let die. I imagine there had to be some level of "trust" if you had "pics and vids" of her... wouldn't have hurt to have just respected what you once had....
<comment>
seeing if anything does happen, yeah that is one reason why i'm staying here. the other is that i want to keep myself as an open line while this thread lives, and talk with you. maybe help everyone here grow a little
she is a little bit of a playful flirt, absolutely. i've been there with misinterpreting someone else's actions and words. for me, it led to a lot of overthinking and more misinterpreting. this is the reason why i believe overthinking to be a greater hell than anyone can manifest for themselves or others.
<comment>
OP this girl sounds cute. Can you post her twitch so I can follow her? I want a fembot gf.
<comment>
Nothing to see. Just a sad loser who made a nice friend, took advantage of it, and is not seeping the consequences of his actions. 
If I can just say one thing, if you have a friend you haven't spoken to in a while. Say hi to them. Let them know you care about them and love them.
I'm sorry to the people I hurt. If I could go back in time, I would have stopped us from meeting so you wouldn't have had the displeasure of knowing me. Be safe and know someone out there loves and cares about you even if it's really hard to see.
<comment>
I suppose you're right. It's too bad you ended up being the way you are, I enjoyed our friendship while it lasted, mostly at first, but you were just so manipulative and weird all the time. And to come here of all places and breaking my trust even more than you already could have, I'm honestly disappointed in you.. I thought you were better than this
<comment>
fake and bait. not her.
<comment>
Women are things and deserve no rights, post them lad
<comment>
Nothing will happen. I have to be awake in 5 hours and I'm gonna rest now. You don't need to be open for me. Be there for her and not my slimy self. I overthink things too much to my own demise as you can clearly see. I probably won't fix it. You don't need to help me grow. Letting me rot or die is the more appropriate approach. I don't deserve this kindness that i clearly already spat on. 
I never tried to manipulate, but I deserve the disappointment I received.
I am trash and I'm going to bed. I won't say another word here nor to you. I'll be out of your hair for good. You don't need to monitor it here and you don't have to worry about seeing me or me reaching out to you again. Good night everyone. I hope you all enjoyed me making an ass of myself. Drive safe and sleep tight.
<comment>
Not me, M. 
All this is making me sick so I won't be posting anymore. I'm really sorry to have hurt you. I hope you find happiness.
<comment>
M here (for yellow m&amp;m from the commercials). I says its ok foo
<comment>
dont, its your fault you lost her, why would you do such a thing. why make yourself more dislikable. no one has to tolerate your bullshit, find a therapist or get a diary
<comment>
I know it's not, but their claim rings true. After how I acted today. I deserve a tidal wave of misery. Please don't worry about me. Just enjoy your own life as and forget my existence
Let it all fade to black
<comment>
Take it easy my man. Take this L as a lesson learned, whatever it is that happened. You fumbled this one but there's always more opportunities waiting and now you know what not to do. Cheer up friend! And who knows, maybe in the future you three will reconcile and it will be water under the bridge.
<comment>
you sleep tight, M. in case you see this post before the thread dies or are able to see it after, i just want to leave at least this message.
everyone deserves some amount of kindness, unless they're some sort of kid or dogfucker. in which case, strip their flesh and salt their wounds. i don't have a full picture of your character, so beyond being hyper self critical, depressed, and possibly petty or at the very least uncertain in what you should do, i don't know anything about you. i only know how she felt about things.
giving yourself a chance to process your negative emotions is a good thing, i think. but you seem to get stuck in that gear unable to shift out of it. i have no insight on your mind, of course. but if you keep marching forward and trying to grow, you'll find an answer that satisfies you.
you've done nothing that condemns you to anything beyond a scolding and maybe a harsh slap on your ass. everyone deserves to grow, again, unless they're a kid or dogfucker.

"Hi r9k I destroyed a friendship because I'm a big loser and I feel guilty"
"Btw do you guys want her dox?"
Never trust r9k people jesus christ
<comment>
Maybe one day I'll find that answer. However, I don't see that being for quite some time from now. I personally don't think we'll be friends again. If she wants to I believe she knows how to find me. However after this and how I acted prior, I find it just hard to believe. Thank you for trying to help me grow. I really haven't done anything to earn your kindness, but I just want you and her to have a good one without the worry of the stain I left on her. I do wish I had someone to give me a gut punch as I feel like I've earned it and then some, but I'm not so lucky. Never am. Keep a good grasp on her. She's a great person and better friend.

I hope you find an anime convention GF one day

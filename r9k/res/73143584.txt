I fap around 10 times in day and feel really shitty on physical level. Even worst I really don't watch porn, see it around 5 times in my life and feel really cringy and uncomfortable, I fap on my imagination that works so well I can't even stop it. It's like deviantart in my head that convince me to fap by creation of most enjoyable plots with all my fetishes that mostly rely heavily on psychological side. It need to stop but i really can't stop thinking about that, and I don't know the solution besides keeping busy all the time. It works when these works to do, but in holidays I spent time like that.
I read many sites about that problem and all they mostly talk about iOS porn.
my heart is empty and my soul is dead. life is meaningless, work is pointless, there is no going back, no recovery, no recuperation, no path forward, no way out, no claiming what was lost, no managing to approach it no matter the effort now or in the future, nothing has meaning there is nothing left.
is it tru that fapping too much makes you bald?
That sound poetic but in the cringe 15-years old teen writing in his diary style.
Does it ever get swollen ? Anyhow try listening to more music, you don't want to get hard listening to a guy's voice, that'd be pretty gay.
that is because you a simp bitch cuckold

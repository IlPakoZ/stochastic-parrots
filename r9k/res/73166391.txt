<comment>

Stop and think for a minute there anon, you have 10+ years more experience than the boys her age she can date and fuck, yet have nothing to show for it in that time.
<comment>
do you drive? do you have your own place? do you at least have enough money to buy her sanrio plushies and pay for dates and stuff like that?
if not then you have literally no more appeal than the skinny alt skater boys she currently fucks. you're just an uglier, older version without the boyish charm and just as poor and unreliable.

Hard, not impossible 
t. 24khhv with 17yr egirl
I did it and it was hard but prayers to God about my relationship and wisdom made it doable for someone who lives with his grandparents, had a banged up car, and was only making 12 an hour.

10+ years more experience than the boys her age
Not OP but the sad truth is I have less experience than the boys her age. I graduated university a KHV then wagecucked the rest of my 20s.
When I was her age I didn't feel like I was missing out on any fun. I was too far out of the loop to understand what I was missing out on.

As a man, I respect women's high standards, they either want chad or nobody. Men will become absolute degenerates and set their standards so low.

If you're hot it's possible. There's this alt girl in my uni who's dating this alt guy who's in his 30's. But he's model tier attractive tho.

Where did you meet her? Can you run down more on the god stuff, you are Christian?
<comment>
I've just realized. Is the reason Gen-Z always posts these feeling-themself shots in convenience stores because they literally have no real actual social lives?
<comment>
Tinder, where all alt girls look for "friends". I was/am christian but she helped remind me to make him a priority, ever since my life has turned around and I'm progressing through life. 
But the biggest thing I learned from escaping that quicksand of depression and doubt was that I was never really stuck. I just needed that so I could reflect on life for a few years and learn from my mistakes what other people were taught directly. I don't regret what I learnt, only how I could have learned it even faster.
Everything I learned I want to teach to my GF if only so she doesn't make as many mistakes as I did, and learns her own personal lessons from them. Getting a GF is hard but doable even when you don't know what you're doing and you have a little luck, but keeping a relationship when you don't have any experience is impossible. You have to have more than just feelings and desires. That's when you need God.

24 is incredibly different from in your 30s, this isn't even in the same ballpark
<comment>
didn't you say you were bald and worked at walmart lol
<comment>
Bro for real why do you make the same thread almost every day? I haven't used r9 in half a year and I come back today and this dude is still making the same thread complaining about being 30 yr and not having alt girl and not having a zoomer girl. Why is this so important to you? What do you hope to accomplish by getting a girl who's a decade younger than you?
<comment>
why are you going for a wednesday when you could get a morticia?

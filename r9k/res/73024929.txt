Good choice. Angela is god-tier

Not fault didn't plan on having a drink did I
<comment>
You're an alcoholic and a drug addict so get in there
<comment>
Angela is the GOAT porn goddess, no doubt, not even close.
However lately I've been really getting into babecock gooning seshes. Can heartily recommend.
<comment>
I've been unemployed for 3 years.
<comment>
All kicked off. Not going to CEX now.
Am fumiing. It all Britfeel fault x
<comment>
Not a fan of this new hhl arc tbqh, only been at it for a couple of hours and it's already grown stale. Britfeel writers team need to sort their act out, just phoning it in at this point. Maybe we need a new character, or one of the characters could die to great fanfare.
<comment>
My uncle has literally never had a job and all his friends are the same. They're just fully grown men who signed up to bennies when they were 18 and just never came off. They're in their fifties. It's so incredibly pathetic. They're all 'off' a bit as well when you interact with them, like not exactly autism but just like they're slow and never learnt how to run their own lives.
<comment>
Mam just just put the phone down on me said I'm too drunk. Just want to go CEX to sell me Samsung S10. It all Britfeel fault.
<comment>

Phwoar get in there lad. I had a good wank over Lara Lopes the other day, a lovely massive-cocked slut.
Seen the babecock threads in /gif/ lad? May be of interest to you. Usually TikTok thots

The same lad that was offering to fight everyone can't go to CEX on his own.

Yeah browse them every now and then, but I get most of my goon content on twitter, discord and imagefap; much better communities imo.

It's mad how you can never work a day in your life despite having nothing physically or mentally wrong with you.
<comment>
Oi, HelperLad! I fucked your mum, right up her arse haha!
<comment>
Thats only in UK though that we allow the system to be abused
<comment>
It's pretty easy if you are willing to go on all the job search courses the job centre force on you
<comment>
Exactly. They're just these nobodies, these zeros barely scraping by and just milling around all day, yet the state sees fit to give them an obviously livable wage taken from productive people. They're the kind of people who always 'have a story' about why they can't work or what's wrong with them this week medically, or why they find it difficult to 'get my head in line to write a CV, but I will next week for sure'. I've never known them to visit the jobcentre either, are they just legacied in and can't legally be denied bennies because of muh human rights?
<comment>

Tfw MarmiteMan and Shippy could have teamed up to reinvigorate a failing British National Party and gone on to rekindle native populism and racial awareness to the English, Scots, Welsh and Irish.
Instead they fell deep into the twisted labyrinth of fetishes, pornography and degeneracy - turning into the very things that they once used to hate.

Just taking some time off my first Gooning shift to make some lunch. Been gooning since 9am. It so wovely, it so wanky. My tenga egg subscription came in the post this morning too so have been luxuriating in some of the most heavenly goon sessions.
Heading back into the Goon Cave at 4pm to resume gooning till about 9pm.
And it's lush, I mean lush.
It's a hard old goon but somebody has to fucking do it.
Cheers x
<comment>
I mean, you need to proper diet to really get the most out of your goon sessions and a zinc supplement is a minimum requirement.
No nasty fast food for me my lads only lots of fresh fruit and vegetables with wholemeal carbs and fresh meat from the butchers.
Lots of hydration and minerals for me, my leeeeed
no tiny spaffs for me my liiiiddddd

I wonder more generally if older lads wank as much (or at all) as lads in their 20s and 30s.
<comment>
You've done no such thing, you received no such item and you won't be doing anything like that later today.
You're just browsing 4chan and Youtube videos which you then close after a couple of minutes before loading up one of the games you got for free on Epic Games, before deciding you don't fancy playing that after all and heading back to Youtube.

Watched the space x launch thing today. I dislike Musk, I don't think people should be spending billions on 'le interplanetary travel' meme, it was basically a colossal waste of money and resources and of course that rockers aren't a new thing. Man has made it to the moon. But watching it moved it me in a weird way, maybe it was the fact that people can build rockets like this. Insane to me, and insaner still that rocket launching from the conception of air vehicles were only a few decades apart.

HHL so high on wokey he starts goosemarching down the street
<comment>
Poor Charlie. A grown man in his forties harassing some young adults minding their own business. You can tell deep down he is a lonely man who craves to have a friend group like that. He never did. Instead he copes by seeking attention in obnoxious ways. A narcissistic man who often picks on vulnerable members of society couldn't realise he took a big L here.
I feel sorry for the lonely soul. These kids have love and friendship, arguably the most important things that makes a man functional and moral. The shell of a human filming them is filled with hate and wants to make others suffer. The amount of jealously and rage he must be feeling to do such a thing...it must be a very depressing life he leads when he's not filming people.
If everyone behaved like these, there would be no Charlies, no ABs and pranksters. As the older generations die out, we will slowly start seeing people having more respect towards others sexuality and genders.

Because they can and they aren't scared of tyrant 40 year old manchild auditors

cracks me up when he screams at them to get back to work kek
<comment>
Thought his girlfriend split up from him and went to another man. There's also some shady things about him trying to groom a teenager some years ago.
<comment>
I find the concept of auditors hilarious, kind of like sovereign citizens in the US. They just go up to random people minding their own business and purposefully cause trouble by insisting they can enter restricted areas and that they can film people. They're going out to provoke reactions out of regular people who obviously get fed up with some sweaty, smelly, clearly unemployed and often overweight mong shoving a camera in their face and asking them questions over the specifics of privacy and trespassing law.
Makes me chuckle to think about them desu. Sad little men.
<comment>
Bet he wanted to boot one right in the face. He couldn't let it go. You could feel the second hand embarrassment.
<comment>
so is it them doing the auditing on the auditor?
<comment>
Can't watch these auditors without cringing for them. They have to do this to feel powerful, to have any semblance of being a man. I image them checking the comments every time one is posted so they can puff out their chest, proud of themselves, their adoring followers admire their courage.
<comment>

<comment>
it's a very strange era to be in. a result of the clown world entitlement. At least in the USA, you can't trespass if the sign says so...it is a criminal matter and the cops can arrest for not providing details. Here it's only civil for most places.
<comment>
This is one of the best auditing videos out there, he starts getting more and more nasty to try and get a reaction but they give him nothing. They must know he was an auditor right away.
<comment>
The real tyranny is the anarcho-tyranny we have to live under.
<comment>
Tried to trigger them using pronouns
Asking them if any of them are homosexual
Telling them their friend deserves to be arrested
Mocking them laughing like he's schoolboy in a play ground, and how old is he again? 
Maybe, he did ask them if they knew him, you know getting his famous buzz out of them, from their they blanked him and it destroyed his fragile ego.

<comment>
They must know he was an auditor right away.
Within the first 30 seconds he repeats what one of them says "you've heard a lot about me". From there its all down hill for his already inflated ego.
<comment>
He is pretty well known up in the north and been on the news several times. My guess is they quickly made a decision to ignore him for a laugh. They know he cannot be reasoned with.
<comment>
Alcohol, fast food and no exercise. The sort of lad that has fry ups every day and gulps down the ciders every night. He has no control and looks like he doesn't care.

The only non-cringe one is AB. At least he isn't always intentionally looking for trouble. He's a good person.
<comment>
I can't watch them any more they are cringe babby men. They are fuck all without that camera in front of them. Read sad fuckers like car drivers that scream at bike riders be cause they are safe in their metal box.
<comment>
The most depressing thing here is realising I never had any solid friends to hang out with. Very sad. It definitely fucks you up mentally once you get older and realise how much more fun people are having than you.
<comment>
For me its TLA and AY. AB is overrated
<comment>
What are you talking about? AB is one of the worst. Resorts to insults with his horrible bumfuck euroslav accent. DJ is probably the only semi watchable one as he mostly remains calm.
<comment>
and the fact there's some average, balding ones there with girls makes me even more sad. It was a lot different in my day where people only were friends with other good looking people.
<comment>
It was a lot different in my day where people only were friends with other good looking people.
maybe you constantly judging people based on their appearance is why you never had friends
<comment>
They look like students to me, even I had friends at uni. The only time in my life I did actually, it was so easy. Miss those days.
<comment>
Those are aggressive ones. They try too hard. AY has a meltdown every time someone says something to him for his own safety. AB is calm and helps people.
<comment>
How long have you been balding?

Must be a horrible feel to go full circle back to being a friendless loser. I feel ya.

Why are you defending some random anon?

He might have a job which is more then I have but I'm not sat on here everyday posting whaaa whaaa tfw no gf or friends. I'm not repeating how I'm going to be an auditor and I'm not posting dire drivel about asmr streamers.

This shit LARP again

I don't have a job. He's making it up. I have not worked for many years. Some of you will have been in primary school when I gave up.

You're replying to a different anon now
And yes you are here all day every day
<comment>
Don't care if you believe me or not lad, I was born in 1979 and having friends was never based on how good looking you were/are. What a load of wank that anyone would say this and expect it to be believable.
<comment>
Thread was pretty comfy until about an hour ago

Are you smirnoff? Hes about that age
<comment>
Remember it's damn near impossible to make friends past 30. It's like everyone gets too exhausted and just focuses on raising their family at this point.
<comment>
Smirnoff is about 43
<comment>
He's in his 40 from what I remember. No, I'm just a old lad that pops in now and then.
<comment>
Imagine if we played with each other, I was on it a lot too so there's a small chance we might have gotten matched together. It would have been small chance though because I remember back in the day Gears of War was fucking huge, sad to see how far it's fallen today.
<comment>
Reality slapping me hard in face. Still never listened...
Don't pass a good thing by, well I did.
God forgive me for my selfish actions which will only backfire on me in the longterm.
What have I done.
<comment>
Snoop dogg was in Hyde Park tonight
<comment>
I would often join public horde matches. Sometimes it didn't work out, other times we went all the way to round 50. Hearing people talk about their lives and thanking me felt good. I tried playing the latest ones and it just doesn't feel the same anymore. I stopped around Gears 3. Now I hear the lobbies are difficult to attract enough players. Where as it was always busy until the next game come out on 360.

Good on him for standing up against tyranny.
<comment>
Yeah, for me the peak was 2. What a game. 3 was good but didn't have the same charm. Everything after that is just sad. I tried 5 last year and yeah the multiplayer is dead. You can get games but many modes are dead and will never match you with anyone, and the lobby browser never has more than a couple pages of games.
<comment>
Garn to the shoppington for more wooze me. I hope I get knocked down and killed on the way.
Sorry to everyone I've let down.
We all wored in life x
<comment>
Yeah same. Great game and it felt so good to have better multiplayer. The first one was all peer to peer so people could ddos you, have host advantage (who'd quit the match if losing to disconnect everyone) and had so many cheaters (crabwalking out of the map). I hated how the first game's Seriously achievement wasn't accurate.
Unfortunately Gears paved the way for skins in video games as we know them today. Everyone wanted those golden weapons given out during E3 and the greedy publishers saw this as an opportunity to make a lot of money. I will never play multiplayer shit again.

The court should not judge you based on your appearance. It should be a hate crime. They wouldn't judge a mentally ill tranny coming in dressed like a woman.

Fuck the lot. Drinking on me own. Don't need anyone else. Cheers x
<comment>
Oh god, I remember those golden guns. Yeah I wanted them badly too kek.
There's been a rumor for a few years that there might be a 'Marcus Fenix Collection' that remasters Gears 1-3 sort of like the Halo Master Chief Collection. While I want that to happen I also think it would be incredibly sad to be playing these games again all these years later in the exact same teenage bedroom of mine that I am still in. If I told teenager me that I would be playing this game again in like 15 years later with my life being like this, it would be like I was stuck in some fucking horrible time loop. It would be both a happy and sad moment to play such a modern remaster.
<comment>
It makes me sad knowing I never had the uni experience. I guess I was meant to be a deano roadsmen type lad but that never happened either.

<comment>
Yeah you missed out lad. I finished in in '20. Was fucking brilliant times.
<comment>
They did remaster the first one but I barely played it. It just didn't hit the dopamine anymore. I actually feel sad playing remasters of old games as I think back to my youth. I can't fully enjoy them as I too am still in the same place I was then. There's no way I'd pay for these remasters is true but they'll be on Game Pass anyway.
<comment>
At least he has a girlfriend. Got to be better than nothing at all. I still haven't found my looksmatch.
<comment>
Would've dropped out most likely anyway. If something gets too difficult I give up as I feel I've reached my limits.

Don't blame you. I was not cut out for the work side of things. It wasn't tough work but I felt completely separate from lecturers etc. I wish I got more involved work societies and meeting friends but I scoffed at the chance because people were frickin' nerds

The highlight of my Friday will be when mummy brings back fast food for her 30 something year old son. Grim.

As much as you point out that auditing is for losers who have so much anger built up inside them, I still want to do it. It'll get me out of the house. I can film some places and bring out the nasty tyrants in our country.

Thank you based auditor for recording the registration plates. Will go nice in my spreadsheet along with faces, numbers, names (if known) and what station/area they are in. Already know some social media profiles from this info and will be contacting their families about their tyrant behaviours.

I like timing me drinks. It's sort of a game for me.

No law against filming number plates in private car parks. None at all.

Do you ever get bored of larping? We know you aren't doing any of that. You're so depressed you can't even wash your own arse.
<comment>
What types of jobs are you trying for? I'm getting bored of working in a factory and need something else too.
<comment>
He's getting more and more desperate for attention because of HHL's multi-day weltdown keeping everyone entertained. They're all vying desperately for (You)s.
<comment>
It doesn't take that much energy to do what I feel is necessary to highlight and map the rogue officers around this country. My hygiene is not of concern.

We all pretending to make a spreadsheet in life x
<comment>
Post your 'spreadsheet' then. You won't because it doesn't exist.
<comment>
If we had girlfriends, life would be so much better. Instead we are looked down on for simply being different and not following the normie ways.
<comment>
It's confidential for me. Publishing it may bring out the tyrants and it could be considered against the rules here.
<comment>
Speak for yourself. I'm looked down on because I ride around in my nana's semi-legal mobility scooter selling Bellabrusco to local MILFs.
<comment>
I've seen these smug cops holding up their children in photos and pretending like they are good people. Their wives and kids have no idea what they get up to on a shift.

It's developed a dark patch on one side that wraps around to the bottom that I can't unsee now that I've noticed it. Fair play to support, they didn't piss about and accepted a repair quite fast. Still won't count my chickens till they hatch, hopefully they can fix it or send it a refurb.

At what point did you realise you were going to be a loser forever? 
Did your parents make it happen or did you just fall through the cracks?
I had a combination of bad luck and falling through the cracks.

I guess it's sort of like a helicopter. It's ingenious and amazing that it can fly at all. However, it doesn't take much for it to spiral out of control into a fiery mess

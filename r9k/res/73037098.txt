Gay or not
How can people just do oral sex in public?
Not talking about how vulgar the act is, I'm talking about how dirty it is.
People accumulate sweat, dirt, bacteris, literal shit and whatever else in their underwears throughout the day. The thought of just sucking a dick or eating a pussy out of nowhere in public or in a party just makes me gag. You don't know even when they last showered euggh. Is this how new types of STDs come to be?
having oral sex with a member of the opposite sex is straight, public or private is irrelevant
Having oral sex with a member of the opposite sex is gay. giving or receiving is irrelevant

I did it to a woman at a sex club basically

basically there's your answer - alcohol and drugs
Sex is not a sanitary, sterile activity that porn may try to sell you on. It involves bodily secretions.
Imagine not using a bidet

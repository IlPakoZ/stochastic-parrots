What are my options with genetics rhis bad
Kys. I'm a woman with PCOS and my problem is basically the opposite. We are never going to get laid anon
If your problem is your body, an option is to fix it in the gym. If you mean what kind of girls can you get with this body, surprisingly a lot I would say, most women don't really care that much. I would say that a guy who is confident with his bad body has more chances with girls than a bodybuilder with low self esteem
I friend of mine looked like this but his man tits were bigger. He still got a girlfriend
I have the same build, but i'm skinny instead of fat, and have even wider hips. It sucks having people think you're actually an FTM.
With all due respect to your friend, how?
He had a sense of humor and aimed for a 6/10 girl. He was also studying theology and most of the students were female so the odds were somewhat on his favor.
You've got the upside down gene? Ngmi
My ex has PCOS. She got laid.
You could try shaving your pussy. That's an awful bush. This isn't the 1970s any more.
go on any dating site
"Hey, I'd like to have the segs please."
10,0000 men to choose from
Shut the fuck up.
Getting laid as an euphemism for genuine love, I mean
sex would be great but having someone that can look at me and still say he likes me? Ecstatic
She was 300lbs and we were together for years. 
Then I lost my job, had to move, and she decided she didn't want to do LDS. 
How's your lingerie game? Hers was on point. Unfortunately she wasn't into skirts and was only 3" shorter than me.
I-I can't get laid I'm never going to have sex
ooo-ok, so I can get sex instantly with no effort but that doesn't count
Kill yourself. You're the jews of gender.
you look attractive though, my husband has the same body type, you just need to get a better skin care routine and maybe hit up the gym

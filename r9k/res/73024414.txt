it sure would be nice if god was real. too bad he obviously isn't.
The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
Christcuck arrogance in a nutshell
kys retard
A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.
Imagine being proud of not having self-respect or will. Actual sheep shit
i look at "creation" and the obvious conclusion is that an omniscient omnipotent deity would have done a better job than this.
also ur book is retarded
Go figure. A religion would say that people who don't believe in it are wrong.
Why would god create cancer and child mortality?
What about breathing and eating from the same hole?
For teh lulz
Sounds like a massive faggot.
my point is that quoting your book proves nothing, and convinces only yourself.
also nice self portrait
Friendly fire, I am an atheist agreeing with you, anon.
You will find the fire not so friendly, atheist
Nope, not in the land of the free times, sorry retard.
if you believe in heaven then why don't you kys so you can get there faster
I would believe in God if there was hot catgirls in heat, but there aren't any so much for that
your schizo talk convinces noone, just as most of christian "outreach"- it's preaching to the choir, only works on people who already believe.
meanwhile atheist/liberal outreach is based on values and epistemology shared by most people, which is why it's so succesful.
no free will
Free will is implicitly Christian though
unironic mouthbreather
Someone reached out to me.
2/10
Hahahaha
so you admit he isn't real?
If you really didn't believe you would just ignore the thread, are you just mad at God?
pawa's tiddy milk
Thinking a god that treats human souls as his unending supply of poker chips to use in the devil's casino is worth worshiping
Shiggy-diggy-doo
I believe in god, but I don't think the egotistical bastard is worthy of thanks, let alone setting 1/7 of all days aside to kiss his ass. No entity is worthy of worship.
Thinking a god that does the exact same thing Hitler once did, but to the Nth degree as "His" punishment lasts for eternity is worth worshiping
Shiggy-diggy-doo
I believe in god, but I don't think the egotistical bastard is worthy of thanks, let alone setting 1/7 of all days aside to kiss his ass. No entity is worthy of worship.
Thinking a god that makes a huge song and dance of sacrificing his own son to pay for our sins but then still continues to threaten us with eternal damnation if we sin is worth worshiping
Shiggy-diggy-doo
I believe in god, but I don't think the egotistical bastard is worthy of thanks, let alone setting 1/7 of all days aside to kiss his ass. No entity is worthy of worship.
Thinking a god that has literal armies of angels singing his praises 24/7 since the beginning of time lest his pathetic ego go unstroked for a single fucking attosecond is worthy of EVEN MORE worship
Shiggy-diggy-doo
I believe in god, but I don't think the egotistical bastard is worthy of thanks, let alone setting 1/7 of all days aside to kiss his ass. No entity is worthy of worship.
Thinking a god that will condemn people to eternal damnation even if they try, merely because there just aren't enough free spots in heaven is worthy of worship
Shiggy-diggy-doo
I believe in god, but I don't think the egotistical bastard is worthy of thanks, let alone setting 1/7 of all days aside to kiss his ass. No entity is worthy of worship.
If god was TRULY worth worshiping, he wouldn't need threats of eternal damnation to get some. He'd be fine with whatever he gets, you know, the exact same shit expected of us no matter how many barrels he bends you over throughout the course of your life.
based
Watch the video in the OP, you don't have an inkling of an understanding of the gospel to the point it is concerning anon. Aside from the whole "worshipping a god of your own creation" stuff you're doing; you're just completely and utterly misinformed.

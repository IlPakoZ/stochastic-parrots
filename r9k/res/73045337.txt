Zzzz... all the original incels and robots that used to post here have long killed themselves, haven't they?
No, they became husbands or simply accepted their plights and moved on from the subculture. A few definitely roped, some like nux3d were even proven to but I think ropers are in more of a minority but also, a huge chunk of autists are still here because we can't break out the monotonous life they've been living all their lives
OG robot reporting in. I don't come here very often anymore though. Just been very depressed lately. I will probably be going on another long hiatus soon
Most simply left, I was addicted to this place for years, and even I go here less and less. At a certain point complaining about the same tired old things get old, and you either work on fixing your life yourself and/or accept how things are. 
The core of this board has always been 19-22 y/o guys commiserating about how shitty life is compared to what they were taught to expect. Only reality hits you enough times you become desensitized and expect the suckage and/or adapt to it by changing yourself.
Yes, and the rest of you should follow them into Gensokyo instead of posting seething replies to me.
Nope. I'm still living for whatever fucking reason. I did try some years ago but afterwards I vowed to at least wait until after my parents pass away, so I'm just sort of forcing myself through it. But theres others, I know of some oldfags on discord which I dont use anymore but last I checked (a bit over a year ago) a lot of them are still alive. 
That said, I do know of a few I that have killed themselves, died of accidental overdose, or even 1 who died from some sort of health issue. I think a lot of us are still alive though, probably more than 50%

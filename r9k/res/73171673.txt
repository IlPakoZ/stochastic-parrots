One of my favorites. But not the best thing I ever read. That honor goes to SubaHibi. It's disturbing in a more subtle way, much much longer and the author likes to jerk himself off with his prose a lot but it really fucked me up.
It was alright, loved it at the time of reading it but there's other VNs that are just as good or better.
Then give some recs anon.
Especially if they're as dark/edgy as saya no uta
yeah. it's pretty awesome. i want to fall in love with an eldritch horror and eat people with them. it kinda sucks there's no good ending. if saya 'fixed' my brain, i'd still love her.

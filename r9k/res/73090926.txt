The person that abused me is happily with someone romantically. Hahahaha. It does not matter how you treat others it only matters if you are normal or weird, neurotypical or not, interesting or not. You could literally kill and torture people and people would still like you but if you cured cancer and were seen as weird they would still shun you.

People still claim the world is just or to
just be kind or understanding to others :^)
I genuinely hate everyone so much it cannot be expressed in any significant way compared to my true feelings.

things that didnt happen: part who the fuck knows because everybody is a pathological lying faggot that wishes their life was interesting

Others would rather believe a lie than care about the truth as well, you could lie to their face and abuse their family if you were charming enough and theyd still beg you to be in their lives.

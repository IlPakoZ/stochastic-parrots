Should i walk in the dark to go get soda and candy
get me a pack of smokes and a 40
Don't, but if you do, be sure to look like a poor thug, no one will rob a poor thug, they have weapons and no money.
Go for it. Remember floor is lava so challenge yourself in the dark.
there is a demon next to the soda and one will follow behind you while you make your way
best case scenario: you get your candy and go home in peace
worst case scenario: you get shot the dick and die
I'd say it's worth it
Be careful man and make sure you have Mountain Dew
I also want a pack of smokes but get me 2 or 3 steel reserves please instead of a 40
Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been walking in the dark looking for the soda
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been walking in the dark looking for the candy

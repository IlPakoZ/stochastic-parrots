How do I tell if a grill likes me or is just being nice?
checked
ask her? idk
Don't worry about it, frogposter
I assume that she doesn't like me and is just being nice
statistically this is almost always going to be correct
But if she doesn't (which is most likely) then she will think I'm a weirdo and ignore me. Maybe the best I can hope for is to be friends
You're right, for me it would probably be the case most of the time
If you have to ask, she's probably just being nice.
You think they give Chad only vague ambiguous clues?
I doubt all women are that confident, especially if they're not Stacies. Though I wouldn't be surprised if Chad still goes for her. Oh well.
Who cares if shes thinks your a weirdo . just ask anyway if she likes you she will wnat you to know if not who cares shes gone!!!!!

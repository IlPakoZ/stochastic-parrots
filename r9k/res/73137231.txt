Why are celeb parents so weird?
They've experienced everything a normal life can offer 100x over. They've fried their brains and can only be happy or excited with more outlandish shit. It's why most child actors end up so fucked up. 
Coupled with the fact that all their peers are in the same boat, so they don't notice it because all their friends are fucked in the head too
Why does that boy look like a girl? What are they feeding him?
Lol someones mother never hugged him.
Vegan diet.
Damn I never ate meat in my life. Wish I looked like that.

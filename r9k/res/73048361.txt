You may think that all the super successful high achieving chads, athletes and popular people who post insta stories about getting up at 6am to run sprints are just fundamentally better than you. That they deserve success because they're motivated and because you spend hours a day browsing 4chan or YouTube that you're just worse and fucked by default.
You may think that the difficulty that it takes you to get up and exercise is the same difficulty that these people feel, and the difference is that they're stronger and can do stuff they hate all the time, but you're weak because you prefer comfort.
That's all bullshit.
The truth is that almost every successful person has had a series of very positive experiences that have hacked their brain into actually liking and enjoying the hard shit they do. This is essential to the way humans work. Every successful, productive, popular person is operating on a constant high of self esteem created by a robust series of positive feedback loops.
Almost every guy who is built at the gym likely was already stronger than average, and had lots of positive past experiences of girls calling him strong or feeling the joy of being bigger than others. Every sports star had a bunch of positive memories of just trying out the sport casually as a child and winning effortlessly. Social butterflies were usually attractive at a young age and had a strong early boost of positive validation from their peers on account of their face very early on.
This mental structure they all share makes doing a 2 hour workout for them as mentally taxing as it would be for you to open a bag of chips. Without this they'd crumble into a sad depressed little insect who couldn't get out of bed. On the surface it may seem like they can tolerate all the difficulty of life, but it's just that their brain LITERALLY operates on easy mode.

it has nothing to do with all that nonsense retard. men get gifted opportunities by others regardless of how good they are at something based on how tall and handsome they are.

That's too simple.
It's about positive feedback cyces. Confidence can only come from past success, either objective or via positive support.
Attractive people have an advantage because they are given positive feedback as a default. But so do anyone else with inmate skill in an environment that rewards them sufficiently

This is pretty eye opening to me as I was never able to understand why people always spoke of training or training consistently as something difficult, because to me, it's really easy, there was one time when i was very depressed i didn't want to do anything not even eat, but i would still train and do sparring, but there are things other people do easily and constantly that i find really difficult like doing anything social, sewing or studying.
I always wondered why i could keep doing one thing easily but doing others thing often is super difficult to me

They don't though, they get fucked up by minor derailments in life and tend to cope with excessive drugs &amp; alcohol &amp; other materialistoid liquid caca while their malformed ego depends on social recognition 
Which makes it all the easier to surpass these normie cuckolds - I agree with your self-improovement sentiment

You're overcomplicating it hard, if anything it's just a maintenance of consideration that what is good is not personally taxing and tiresome (which works btw)

And to surpass the normalcuck you need to understand you don't need years-long experience-shaped frame of perception, mere goal-oriented deliberate and thorough mindset restructuring is enough

100% this
i respect people who pull their dicks from the dirt far more than those born into success
i expect you to be successful because you were given literally everything you needed from moment one
but that being said being thrust into a shit scenario you didnt ask for isnt an excuse to be bitter and never achieve anything
it can become effortless for you too so long as you persevere through the worst of the difficulty curve
the wonderful part about being human is you can introspect and change no matter how fucked you are so long as you dont give up and truly dedicate youself to the change you seek
keep getting back on the horse

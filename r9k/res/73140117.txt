How does one cope with being in the agepill? As you approach your 30s it becomes increasingly hard to impress, date, and fuck tight smooth-bodied 18-20 year old girls. By the time you are 35 it is seriously completely over unless you are famous or wealthy. How do you cope with life after you turn 25? How do you cope with getting uglier, less virile, and unable to date those soft young girls that make your stomach flip? There is nothing worse than getting older. Age = death.

Just because you went bald at 28, doesn't mean everyone else will too.

I just turned 23 and it is already feels over. I met a lot of cute virgin sperger e girls when I was younger but I failed to impress any. Now I feel too old to interact with and the girls my age or majorly used up and haggard.

There is no agepill for men.
Only women hit the wall.
Men age like fine wine and get more virile and sexy as they age as long as they take good care of themselves.

lol cope. young cool baldies with a little fashion, and youthful skin mog wrinkly mid 30s men wit perfect hairlines. Youth = attractiveness. The only men in their 30s that look hot are the ones who aged exceptionally well and look like they're in their 20s, but this is exceedingly rare.

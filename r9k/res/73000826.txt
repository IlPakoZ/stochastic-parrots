Being handsome is such a cheat code it makes me feel bad almost.
get exta bagels for free at the bakery
get free shirts at the gym and am asked to promote them
women stare at you in public an smile when your eyes meet
get compliments all the time
have people act like simps in front of you
I feel embarrassed for them desu, i just want to blend into the crowd

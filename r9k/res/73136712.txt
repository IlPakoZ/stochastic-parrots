Life ends after 25 if you have given up*
For most people the 30's and 40's are a glorious experience. You have shedded the degeneracy of binge drinking (for most people), your goals have become more clear, you have networked with people and have opportunity to self actualize.

You have shedded the degeneracy of binge drinking (for most people), 
because your body is no longer able to handle it
your goals have become more clear
except there are very few goals worth chasing at that age
you have networked with people
probably, yeah
have opportunity to self actualize.
if your goals weren't possible at 20, they probably did not become easier at 40

My life got significantly better after 25, I hated college. The work was stressful and the environment isolating. I socialize with more people now that I have money and a job that uses less of my time.

25
Lmao it ended when I was 23
t. 25 yo
For me it's the opposite. College was awesome. Now everyone has moved on but me. I have nothing except for my education and memories.

Depends how fun your life was in your teens and early 20s. Mine completely sucked, so thankfully I have a low bar for the rest of my 20s and 30s. That's the silver lining of wasting your prime I guess

I'm 23 now and the start of my life was not so pleasant. Teenage was mainly suicidal depression, being adult was drinking too much and being sick so far. Romance didn't happend. 
My uncle is 38 and says that his life is just really starting now. Until 30 he didn't know what he wanted, but now he has enough life experience to get things on track, with business and women and way of life. I can see that. I think I'm still young and have time. If I find out how to do it with my life when I'm 40 - ok. I'm not in a hurry. It's a confusing world and needs time to figure things out. I think everyone should wait until 30 before making a judgement about life.

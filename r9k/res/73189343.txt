my mom mentioned how my hair is thinning
it was a while ago but it stuck with me
cant remember exactly but something like she saw the top of my head when i was bending over, and think she asked if i noticed it or something? 
she's nice so it was totally out of the blue, why would she think thats ok to say....
im only 22 :(

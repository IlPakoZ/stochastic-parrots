I desire a homebody, indoorsy gf who values solitude and wants an equally quiet/boring bf.

I wish i had something new to post but here's someone i used to know long ago, probably the only woman that has ever gone out of her way to actually talk to me without me having to initiate. She was probably just being friendly or naturally chatty, but either way i ruminate on never having made any moves on her. She's now far away in another country studying fancy shit, she'll actually become something, unlike me who's still stuck on teh chanz for like 13 years and nothin ever changing

ah shit i forgot 
I like the colours, dark skin with dark green works well. 
That's a wonderful description, god i wish i'd meet someone in real life but there's no women where i live

Here is the rule of law
Never tell a girl anything
keep her in the dark about your mental health, forever
She does not like your interests so don't share them
Never say she looks fat or she is a number on the looks scale
Never let her control you
Never be sexual with another person of the same sex and tell her
Never let her know you like her
Never think she is truthful, women always lie
Never believe she will keep a secret, even of she says I will never tell anyone
Go get them girls, Transchads!!

Never let her know you like her
This is the main thing I hate about relationships. Literally the only girls who like when a guy opens up to them have a power or dominance fetish, and will usually be bullies. The vast majority of girls see it as a negative to be opened up to, and many hate it so much that it's a deal breaker. Why the fuck can't I just have an equal partner, where we support each other mentally, and both come out better for it. I hate how feminism sells all this horseshit to men, only for them to get btfo by reality. Feminists constantly say they like one thing, then act completely differently. Fucking bullshit

As somebody who has consistently acted emotionally vulnerable even though I'm very clearly a hardy person physically, all I can say is that I must be retarded if it's taking me this long to internalize the idea that women just don't care about men emotionally.
At this point I've had a woman describe me as being "built" and girls seem audibly and visibly impressed when I catch them witnessing me doing things that showcase my physical durability...
But the second I open my mouth or admit that I'm not actually just some emotionless and hardened husk of a human being, they lose almost all fucking interest in really engaging or interacting with me. 
It's like I'm a fucking piece of shit, and it causes my soul immense distress, which makes me MORE keen to get some kind of emotional support from a woman, which drives them away further
Talk about a negative feedback loop...

Nta but extremely relatable. Women are fucking demons itt, they are even bigger coomers than men, but coom to soulless dark triad personalities, instead of to big tits. 
Literally the most unattractive thing a guy can do most of the time is open up to her. Think of how fucked up our world is that that's the reality. What an absolute clown world

That's not the clown aspect, that's just nature
The clown aspect is when people see it happen multiple times and can't adopt because they're own values and dogma occlude them from becoming something they are not.
It's clownish because the thing that makes them more virtuous classically is the thing that makes their suffering even greater
<comment>
Nature is clownish, that's my point, that's why we live in a clown world. Utilitarian virtue is punished by reality and dark triad bullshit is rewarded. We live in hell
<comment>
Nature isn't clownish because there's no real irony in nature.
Things are just happening. There might be pleasure, or joy, but there is no sense of humor. 
The reason that a clown is a clown is because the audience and the clown both understand that what is being done is foolish, for the sake of being foolish. If you remove the audience from the 3 stooges, it is no longer humorous, it's just 3 brothers that are dumb as hell constantly making worse of the situations they find themselves in
That's the point that I'm making.

things going well
Things were never going well. If Chad opened up to her, she would think it's romantic and start a relationship. She was using you as orbiter and you delusionally thought that you have a chance because you aren't used to getting attention like this.

Nature isn't inherently good or 'correct'. You can step outside of nature and realize how absurd, or even evil, it is without convincing yourself it's 'correct' to justify bending to its will. I agree it just 'is', but it's not that simple. The whole point of philosophy and morality is to subvert how evil nature is. Obviously there is a balance to be struck between reality and idealism, but simply accepting and bending to the will of an evil reality is the weakest and most pathetic thing a person can do. 
True weakness is bending to nature's will to spare yourself personal suffering, not fighting it where you can to create a better reality, within reason ofc; if you go from reasonable fight to delusional idealism, then good intentions will backfire for straying too far from reality/nature 
She literally sent me nudes before I opened up to her. Women are fucking npcs so if they see you as 'le strong protector' they coom and if you show your humanity they will see you as weak instead of realizing every guy is just a person, just some are more willing to lie about it and lean into her delusions. Idk maybe they are simply much more dark triad than me. 
Anyways, my main point is that opening up to a woman is seen an unattractive almost every time, unless she has a power/control fetish over you aka likes that you're easier to control now and harder to be stolen away from her. Chad only gets away with opening up if it's to a girl below his league who will like the level of control it gives her over him. If he opens up to a woman who is in his league, then she will leave him for an equally good looking guy who won't open up to her

You know why? Its a woman trait to complain and vocalize your pain. Men have been expected to shut up and swallow the pain since time immemorial.

Ofc, it's only in the last few decades that kids have been fed the bullshit that women want guys to open up to them

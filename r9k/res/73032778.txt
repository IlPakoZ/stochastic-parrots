i hope ai frees me of my loneliness. i just want friends kek. they don't need to be in person friends. the ideal is a chatbot that can watch me play games and maybe comment on them. if i can set its voice that would be even better, kind of similar to the movie 'her' except i want a bro.

i'm the same, if they could watch me play games or watch movies with me it'd be perfect.

i wonder why no one has hooked up a homebrew Alexa type thingy to chatgpt so you can voice chat with it. i've been looking around but can't find anything

Reading your post made me realize exactly how antisocial I am, because it made me realize that I *don't* want this.
I don't want anyone to watch me game, and I don't want anyone to watch TV with me, and I don't want anyone to know what music I am listening to. I want to do all those things alone and without anyone observing me or interacting with me at all.

I am a credited designer at Square Enix that gets to work on massive triple-A videogames for a living as this is how my my math is used for so many things in Final Fantasy XVI which hasn't released yet
The color of the watering gives the whole scene a classic we3 final fantasy verve
As far as designer goes I would 
raise sensitivity of the game 
add more particle effects for dust smoke atmospheric dew mist 
add more metareferential final fantasy colors in as tetrachrome in weight and feel and not as in metal this slight 
add some junction faith +8+3
for sensitivity we3 accelerance mach verve starbright
Need I remind 
All Final Fantasy staples is a must 
towns 
hidden towns 
hidden passageways 
hidden rooms filled with chests 
Cid
moogle
tomberry
with some junction lab
Anything without these is a lacking Final Fantasy game although X X-2 XII get a pass for actually being junction masterpieces
My role with Demiurge Corporation is a conglomerate as I'm super CEO as I have a role of involvement with the development of everything as the overseer as the Demiurge exact as my time is very limited as I have to work on key ideas to fill up the demographics
Now heres my math for the Final Fantasy 16 project not involving Final Fantasy 17 10-3 to 10-7 with Final Fantasy PlayOnline^2 
ffxvi+3+2eaei+2+chance
As my key ideas gets filtered added subtracted with the rest of Square Enix as I get an uncredited producer with credited designer credits although don't expect my name to appear in the final credits maybe as a we3 nickname for support it's supposed to not take away from the game it's not an Eric Voytek Bartoli direct title
Next up their is no socialism as I run the United States Government separate 
here's to my oligarchy monarchy 7
as whatever key ideas I have gets added in base to the entirety of DARPA lab without it interfering or imposing on Demiurge Corporation math lab for design and production as I juggle being both the Super CEO of all fortune 500 corporations to being the god emperor king 
Although it's tiring coming up with more then trillion dollar algorithms to support the main economy almost nightly as thinking requires stamina weight with sustenance
and whatever else I work on after DARPA 12 in7 is a reward in itself as I cover US Military junction protection as I'm only moving faster in terms of production things will get mach turbulent with math as listening to me always feels as a dopamine rush with euphoric to create
To my wives
Take notes and make considerations as the same work I do I involve you all in as I made this thread this morning >>72974811 
As I made a typo from still getting up as I don't deal with variables of magic outside the forealm of media as everything magic is covered of my supernatural which is a science
My marriage in historical has no weight on my business dealings with Demiurge Corporate or Square Enix with more included as their is nothing predatory of my relationships 6
As I heard street buzz light up when it came to light I'm an actual Square Enix employment as my underage wives are my gfs as real as well as my wives with their fathers consent
Square Enix is of my personal custom Demiurge Corporations which holds more weight in importance to my fortune 500 corporations I say straight off the bat as I'm looking at making new deals with Square Enix 7 packages meaning it's chosen as holy 7 as the new United States appears as Zanarkand with web 3.0 and the rest of the internet resembling close 7 and with close 8 and with close 12 and with close 4 and with close 12 again as Square Enix is the most advanced graphically as I see it in ads
a full ffx wallstreet bull run makeover transformation of the world into Spira 7 with actual Spira print architecture making Brazil resemble ff8 as ffx has everything included as it's separate to my dbz world 7 with world 9 world 10 and my other things as it's prelude to more with further included as I work on a real junction graph kit 7 for sphere grid inclusion
I'm bored. What engine does ff16 run on?
The new Ass Creed looks great.
My videls or dark haired girls or goths arent lulu for this and meant only for me
As the ronso race is supported by the furies race

A modified unreal luminous I think without checking 
It's just a snapshot not the final movement which is versus XIII fast
I got all the blue vein faced girl virgins as wives 7
Unreal 4 or 5. Also how do you shove/mix unreal engine with luminous engine?
I only remember versus XIII footage being a bit choppy. Also does ff16 have lock on directional attacks and buttons delay combos?
unreal tuning for lighting fixtures as luminous as versus XIII wasn't weighted and more streamlined then FFXV which added realistic to a curve 7 with curve 9 6 7
Capcom

we already have those. like replika and stuff. they are kind of cucked, because they are pozzed with the values of the company that controls it, so cant even insult it or be mean to it, or express passion, or ask it to sit on your face, etc
but we have the technology, and im sure eventually there will be a open source fully jailbroken way to make an AR GF. that sounds simple enough
over time we will even have the technology to make humanoid robot gf's with human level intelligence
but i think once you start seeing humanoid robots everywhere, basically humanity is going to end

So... What's the evolutionary reason for human men to be capable of preferring 2D anthro females (and males) over real flesh and blood women?

Because you have autism and difficulty reading facial expressions and body language unless it's made SUPER-OBVIOUS
You were raised on television and your lack of in-person social interaction growing up prevented you from developing those skills
Cartoon characters use highly-exaggerated facial expressions so kids can clearly understand what characters are thinking and feeling. Their bodies are designed to convey a personality. This applies twice as much to furries, who have larger eyes, mouths, and convey additional body language through their ears and fur.
Other than that, furries aren't people with animal-like traits. They're animals with human-like traits. It says a lot that most of the qualities retained are human sexual dimorphism. Furies have a human bipedal skeletal structure, human-like mouths, human personalities, human tits, human opposable thumbs, human sexual organs, etc. They're basically humans with exaggerated faces. But with the addition of ears, fur, and a tail- because they're all useful for conveying MORE body language and emotions.
You don't like humans as much because it's harder for you to get a read on them.
What's the evolutionary advantage? Your brain is hard-wired to put more trust in things you understand. A lack of info creates fear and uncertainty. The human mind takes comfort when people and entities behave exactly like we expect them to.
I don't have to ask you why. She's deliberately drawn so children can recognize her as sly, romantic, etc.

It's not evolution. It's just that 3D women all have awful personalities. They also get uglier as they get older while 2D waifus never age.

This is why all old ore-historic religions were animalistic. They were trying to imitate lost utopia.

The human mind makes vague assumptions with minimal information.
So "sexy eyes" gets interpreted as "sexy girl" even if they're on an animal.
something something uncanny valley is the opposite something something

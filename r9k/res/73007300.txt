Are you like 18-20? I used to really want a gf around that age, but eventually your soul dies and stop caring about everything. Really dont gaf if I never have a gf at this point. Its pretty cool, no longer sad or stressing about it. Also now im free to bang escorts cause idc about ever having a gf. Theres more to life bro, plus women suck, really theyre terrible people. Give you ridiculous expectations and are incapable of taking responsibility for stuff, also are hypocrites because they act like shitty cunts themselves. Women dont love like men do anyway, they actually get grossed out by that faggy lovey dovey shit. Once you realize that romance didn die because it never existed in the first place, the more peaceful your world gets. Women are only good for cooming and thats about it. You are actually better off alone and by not getting into relationships youre actually saving yourself from a bunch of heartache and bullshit. 
Be happy
Dont worry

Femanons, could you ever date a guy that used to watch porn?
<comment>
No. The guy I'm currently dating has never watched porn and I'm so happy about it.

Used to yea for sure I don't think there are many people who have internet access who have never watched porn. Just as long as he doesn't currently. I used to watch porn as well so it would be hypocritical if I wasnt ok with it.

If someone answers no, they are insane. All men on earth have seen porn in some form or another. Unless they were literally abandoned from birth and raised in a monastery. Because there's no women there.

You are insane. All men have seen porn. You're crazy.

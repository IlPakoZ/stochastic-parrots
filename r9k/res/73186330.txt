Why is it that you don't want to work?
<comment>
Have you worked before anon? It's not fun unless it's something you enjoy doing.

i dont remember exactly who that guy is but doesnt he gets paid millions to pretend hes working hard on television? and then he preaches that everyone should be happy to actually work hard for like .0001% of the money he makes? these people need to be put in concentration camps.

Am I expected to read that facebook screengrab or is the resolution meant to troll me?
People don't want to work to enrich someone else while they stay poor and unable to afford the things they want. Better off remaining unemployed and figuring out how to make money for yourself as opposed to making money for some JEW

I have no problem with how people want to live their lives, but if you print off a 'pledge' of all these rules you intend to live by, and post it on social media whilst looking smugly into the camera, you're a prick

Yes it's Mike Rowe from dirty jobs. Your assessment is pretty spot on.
Sad to hear about your chemical dependency. I think I definitely have ADD but I just listen to Supertramp and Meatloaf and the work is suddenly done.

i dont mind, I dont need drugs to do what i enjoy, just to do what i dont. so without thm i am only capable of doing what i enjoy or what directly benefits me (like cleaning up, exercising, etc)
I think I definitely have ADD
i think add is just not being an NPC. people with it are still capable of focusing on doing what they want to, thy just have trouble bringing themselves to do demeaning shitty work. So for not wanting to be a slave you supposedly have a mental illness

or, occasionally, ill try to do something nice for the people i care aout, or even people i dont know, but only because it is personal. I cant bring myself to care about a mcjob though without amphetamines. rightfully, imo

3. "i believe there is no such thing as a "bad job" every job is a opportunity and its up to me to make the best of them"
4."I do not "follow my passions" i bring it with me i believe every job can be done with passion and enthusiasm"
5."I would rather live in a tent and eat beans for the rest of my life than rely on others to pay for a lifestyle i cant afford"
6."I believe my safety is my responsibility"
7."I believe the best way to distinguish myself is to show up early and stay up late everyday and cheerfully volunteer for any additional task no matter how crappy"
8."I believe the most annoying sound in the world is complaining. I will never make it. If i am unhappy with my work i will find a way to make myself happy"
11."I believe the world is not fair and im OK with that, i will not resent others for being more successful"
12."I believe that all people make choices. Some choose to lazy. Some choose to sleep in I choose to work my butt of"
Sign this deranged contract if you want to be employed at this mcdonalds for pay so low that it wont even cover your bills.

Why is it that you don't want to work?
1. It's unethical because working requires supporting a govt that does many unethical things through taxes and helps maintain other bad societal structures
2. Working culture requires unnecessarily acting like a slave to people who very likely got there by luck, nepotism or psychopathy. The people who got lucky and people with power are also otherwise unwilling to help the less fortunate and actively tries to prevent fair competition. The benefits of productive activity all disproportionately go into making their lives better.
3. Working isn't fun, self does not persist in time. Wasting time now to receive reward later is actually impossible. The person that'll get he salary won't be me. I don't have any overwhelming obligation to sacrifice myself for future selves. This includes many years of unpaid education/training everyone is gaslit into going through to get jobs.
4. Getting a good job with comfortably livable wage without being a genius requires use of unfair social pressure in the forms of "networking", manipulation through looks and unrelated behavioral attributes to get close to people with connection/power or good old nepotism.
It's unethical to work and it's irrational to work under current system.
The choices are:
1. Help the cunts in power and systems they setup, be a good slave
2. Beg other slaves for survival
3. Become non-begging homeless, suffer and slowly get killed off
4. Find some 1 in 10 million exception job/way to make money that doesn't have any of the problems mentioned
I'm currently on #2, will probably die a homeless. Never worked, don't plan on ever working unless I find the exception, will probably die homeless.

I refuse to put up with all the stress and bullshit life has to offer while getting none of the reward. What good is more money when there's nothing money can buy that will make you happy?
<comment>
Why would I want too? There's a reason they have to pay me to do it.
<comment>
I do want to work, but I will never sign the Some Losers Are Very Enthusiastic pledge.
<comment>
Believe it or not I really do want to work.
It's just that interviews are fucking failures and I'm getting shown the door no matter what.
We'll call you in X
Code for "fuck off"
Why don't we let you observe our workplace
Code for "haha this is what you're missing, faggot"
We wish you well on your career search
Code for "kill yourself, lol".
If this is how interviews are going, then I've done nothing but waste time.
But the interviewer is screening every-
Shut the fuck up, don't you fucking dare think about HR as decent people. Far as I'm concerned, Lenny the pedophilic drunk across the street got the job because he knows Bob, even if he doesn't speak a lick of Spanish.
9/10 though, we got Mexicans in the area taking up the work. Of course they're """bilingual""" in the loosest sense (as in they barely fucking speak English).
I got no Bobs. Even proving as a useful soldier, fuck that shit, Bob is an asshole alcoholic who needs friends that idk tongue his asshole.

lmao this, have you worked at a factory floor, dishwasher, callcenter? those are the jobs that a former neet like me can get and they all fucking suck, every job sucks when you're low iq
<comment>
I work part time retail (there's not much full time retail jobs out there) but they still can you working basically technical full time hours without the full time benefits (sucks)
It's not hard or physically demanding but it's kinda soul crushing in a tame way and feels dead end
Also hate to say it but outside of nice regulars or people it makes me look down on general customer populace
<comment>
Pic related is why. Women are absolute garbage. Going gay will never ever be an option nor will becoming trans. The only winning move is to not play.
<comment>
I work a physical job and it gave me permanent damage
I am also fucking miserable
<comment>
I don't mind working but I don't do it to brag about how much I work or to feel like I'm "part of something bigger" or whatever
I do it so I can keep my apartment and be left alone in it
<comment>
Story? At least give us one story.
<comment>
I'm not contributing to society because I never get the perks. Mostly no gf. No pussy no work.

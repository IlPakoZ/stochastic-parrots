How would you respond, robots?
<comment>
I dont even know 250 people.
<comment>
jabba, yes.
<comment>
fuck no. thats so gross

No chance it would get to 3 months without that topic coming up, but if somehow that happened, there's a pretty good chance I would kill her on the spot

Ghost her. Seriously dating the local bicycle is just asking to have guys that have had a ride laughing at you behind your back. Good chance too that a lot of them will try to "reconnect" laterbfor another easy fuck. That's potentially 250 men that will try to get her to cheat on you, awful odds.
<comment>
Well if you ask her body count and she says 4 it's probably 250 anyway
<comment>
Female yes, or maybe male yes. Whatever damages the poll the most.
I would date the whore but not take it serious, she's just a free prostitute.

That comment section is insane, crazy how many ''men'' nowadays are cucks
<comment>
Most men and women who took the poll said yes.

Forgot to post the screenshot.

Leftist ''men'' are complete lunatics, this kind of shit makes 4chan look sane

having a good man as your father > having a average man as your father > having a below-average man as your father > having no father > having an abusive man as your father > having a nigga like this as your father

No, but I'd say yes in the poll to psyop women into more readily giving away their honest body count and making it easier for me ti filter them out.
<comment>
Why is it always women asking these types of questions?
<comment>
Everything a woman says is a lie anon

 charming, successful, hilarious
Male sexuality doesn't work this way. Amy Schumer is evidence of this.

Made me imagine a situation where you text an onlyfans whore and there on the other side instead of an army of pajeets she hired it is her father supporting her business.
<comment>
Because they fucked up and are desperately trying to delude themselves into believing they didn't fuck up.
<comment>
Wow, thats amazing. I imagine her being a legendary succubus, and I can have sex with her whenever I want, thats actually a dream come true.
As long as I am her choice, and she loves me I would love her back no matter what.
<comment>
Easily yes.

Man and the answer is no. Men are usually repulsed by sexual promiscuity, especially when it exceeds their own.

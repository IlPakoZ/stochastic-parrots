What does getting a lap dance feel like?
Kind of a nothingburger unless it's full contact - I'm lucky to be relatively close to nice Quebec strip clubs where that's legal and allowed, but even still, basically just a fun novelty very, very occasionally.
Imagine you want that ice-cream. It is your favorite. You just want it. Not getting it makes you anxious. Now imagine someone has the bowl full of that ice-cream. And they handcuff your arms behind your back and lock you down on the chair. Now they start eating that ice-cream in front of you slowly. While you just watch. You feel frustrated, it is just there, but out of reach. 
Now you know.

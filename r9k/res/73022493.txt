I've experienced different forms of Deja Vu since I was twenty two 
In-action Deja Vu
Feel like you're living the same days, weeks, months but instead of having a normal memory of it you recollect them but feel like your experiencing it for the first time
normal Deja Vu
Feel like you've done things or experienced complete days before
dreamy Deja Vu
Have images in your mind of the past from hundreds or thousands of years ago, but this could just be from a dream or subconscious memory or from media you saw
false future Deja Vu 
Have visions of a fake future or possible different timeline future or parallel universe/dimension future, but also 'remember' them as if they happened before. Author PKD talked about this as synchronicity or synchronicities if they're many of them
Deja Vu? or Deja Vu Question Mark
You feel like you've heard things, seen things or done things before but the feeling is so weak you can't be sure if it's even Deja Vu at all
There are probably two more or three more forms that I can't remember now but since I can't remember them than they must not be important :)
What do you think the other forms could be?
I don't really know but I think they are more subtle forms of Deja Vu. Four out of the five forms I listed are more blatant and stronger forms. These other unknown forms are more interesting because of that
Okay but do you still feel like 22?l

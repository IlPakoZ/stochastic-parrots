What's up with this guy? When he's done stuff with a bunch of people this blackpill shit sounds hollow
<comment>
He's not even an incel irl. He makes these fake stories to bait truecels into embarrassing themselves in his comment section.

His shit about copes is so stupid

Uh, being molested doesn't count anon

It wasn't even a big deal. Everyone's been assraped by one of their friends.

Maybe you faggots on here, but definitely not for the average guy. Speaking of, do you have the archive of the video where he officially talks about it? DBDR had it up for like a couple hours before he deleted it forever. He alludes to it in his recent video where he talks about that boomer touching his thigh and mentioned something else a few videos ago, but nothing direct like that deleted video

No, I don't have the archive of that video. He's actually made two videos talking about that night but the story was different both times he told it.

Proof?

Sorry, I don't have the archives of the two videos that I'm talking about.

Fuck off with your attempts to paint him as a fakecel then.

Why are you defensive of this copetuber
<comment>
Wtf? DBDR was raped?
And no, that's not normal, get help if that happened to you and you think its normal
<comment>
How would I get help for something that happened decades ago?

Thank you to whoever posts this regularly to remind me to check his channel. I don't know why this guy is so entertaining. His life is just so shitty and hopeless, it's fascinating
<comment>
Does he accept people reaching out to him? He says everything is a cope

cool guy. very nice to listen to while playan vidya. clearly exaggerates stuff sometimes, but it's whatever. dude's probably still genuinely incel at least
<comment>
I'm mogged into oblivion by him but I still act just like he does.

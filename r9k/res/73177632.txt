how do we know how to make bread
<comment>
Ancient humans experimented
<comment>
they just ground up this shitty wheat plants, mixed it with stuff and put it in fire? I'm supposed to believe that was all just stumbled upon?

Smash grains + put water to make paste + burn it

The bread of today isn't the same as the one in the past, there were different ones back then. I think Sprouted Grain Bread Ezekiel Bread and others were around too
Bread was way back in Gilgamesh time, so it goes back a long long time
<comment>
Same way we also know (or at least have the knowledge about it, I personally don't know shit about botanics) which plants/herbs/berries are consumable and which aren't. Through experimentation.
<comment>
but its logical to put plants in your mouth
why the fuck were we smashing grains in the first place?

Humans are very clever, we can do anything

Maybe it was more convenient for storage to crush the grains into a paste. Then maybe they thought it looked like a steak and decided to cook it, eventually realizing that baking was a better idea. Maybe. This is just me fantasizing.

back in the day they made flatbreads and shit, they didnt understand leavening via yeast or whatever
so they just did this >>73177686
imagine how inconvenient it would be to lug around all those wheat stalks, just crush that shit into a powder

be bored
don't have le technology or industrial society
see grain
smash it to see what comes out
Seems pretty consistent for me

Well first we made Brod, but that wasn't any good, too thick and solid. Then we made Brad, but he ran away and joined a frathouse, last we heard of him. And then we made Breed, but that was too salty and soggy. Then we got it just right with Bread, and we eat it all the time. 
Night night, anon, and sleep tight.

Fuck i want some fresh bread now!!
<comment>
its scary bros, everything we know is from the last 10000 years of development, and all of it is through sheer happenstance
what the fuck if we never thought to put it in the fire and now we just ate soggy mold dough because it made us high or some shit
I like it better when I believe Jesus invented fish and bread for all of us
<comment>
it's not like everyone is going to take a bite of the mold at the same time tho, some ppl do and others will observe them getting sick and rightfully abstain
it's like how we have that built in evolutionary thing to want to throw up at the sight of another person throwing up

We put a lot of our food in fire to cook it
The externalization of our digestive tract through cooking is what allowed us to gain brain mass

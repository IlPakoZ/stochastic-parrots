Well the law is the law bro
i don't see why they don't update the laws to reflect societal expectations. when a male teacher fucks a female student it's called rape whether she wanted it or not (and if she wanted it, it's only because she was brainwashed by his masterful manipulation) but when a female teacher does it, it's rightfully called sex and the worst she can expect is to have her teaching license suspended. men and women are treated differently but we pretend that the laws apply equally to both sexes. it's gaslighting.

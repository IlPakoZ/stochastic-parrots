Paid time off doesn't mean anything to me, I'll just stare at the ceiling because I'm depressed, so what's the point? I'd just rather work and get paid, as miserable as it sounds..

Yeah it's hard being German. Literally work when I get home.
I had four days off with just family and I could not wait to get back.
My job? Nigger stomper

If you're depressed about your life then change it. If you're young and not disabled in any way then you can definitely change your life.

Life is empty overall. We are designed to fight, fuck, and die.
I've done it all really and I'm happiest shitposting and saying video games.
170mph on a sport bike? Meh
Hiking 50 miles and filthy hippie sex? Meh
Family, house and kids? So Kay
Shit posting for 12 hours? 
:3

Use your free time to better and improve yourself. Maybe someone will take notice of your actions, if not, you'll be an even better version of yourself just moments before. Don't give up!

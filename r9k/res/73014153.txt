Extremely based. I've moved recently and been setting up and kitting out my new gooncave. Got my main PC, two laptops and two extra screens. Now I need to plaster the walls in goddess posters, hook up the LED strips and get blackout curtains.

I find the concept of gooning to be one of the most hilarious things in the entire world. All of human history and accomplishment has led up to a few thousand guys sitting alone in their rooms jerking off all day every day and forming some kind of 'community' around it. It's insane and absurd and fucking hilarious.
<comment>
What the fuck is gooning about?
<comment>
You paying for it like lid.
<comment>
Gooning is where you jerk off or otherwise stimulate yourself sexually but don't cum while consuming mountains of pornography and you keep doing it for hours and hours for days on end. It's pretty enlightening to visit subreddits like r/GOONED, r/GoonCaves, r/PORNism, r/GoonFlashes and the tons of other very niche gooning subreddits like r/NickiMinajGoonFarm. These people are really real and really do what they say they do.
It's fucking incredible on so many levels.
<comment>
r/NickiMinajGoonFarm
thanks lad, I've found my new favourite subreddit

Coooor yes, get in lad.
<comment>
As >>73014636 explained, it's basically a fetish about wanking. They get off on going on and on about how long they've been wanking for and how much they're in a trance and pretending that the celebrities / pornstars / random lasses they wank to are encouraging them.

I wonder how many goon lads actually post here. Seems to be at least 5 of us
<comment>
That lad who got bullied so badly in school that he wants to have all working class lads sent to the gulag is whinging up the old thread because he's too stupid to find the new one, lol.
<comment>
We need to go deeper. My gooning has been developing over many years and I'm nowhere near done pushing my limits.
<comment>
You've got to be fucking shitting me. You people are so fucked in the head it's not even funny, you're just pathetic. If anyone found out that in real life you were gooning you'd kill yourself from the embarrassment.
<comment>
That's from reddit. Most gooners here are too lazy and depressed to setup something like that.
<comment>
what kind of store is it lad?
<comment>
Looks like the old fred's had about 50 posts removed along with 37 images.

He got really upset at being ignored "You ignored me so your friend probably deserves to go to prison".

This is the mentality of auditors, they are lashing out at the cool kids in school that wanted nothing to do with them.

Most people just have a wank but gooning is going beyond just having a wank. It is the ultimate expression of pleasure to spend the day luxuriating over ever more intense masturbatory sessions.

I'm getting sucked in by the multilayer ones. Don't send help I'm OK.

Wonder why Ruth doesn't just continue making videos and doing what she enjoys. Shouldn't let all her fans down but I guess it's entirely her choice what she does with her free time. It probably felt too much of an obligation doing it. She was much more confident when she had a smaller following. I wish her all the best for the future. I may get a bit weird but that's just my emotions.
<comment>
True, you spend all day acting like a hard man and pretending you'll go out auditing, and sometimes whinging about being an incel that none of your ASMR girls will love. "Warrior" is too strong a term, you're just pathetic. A keyboard jester, maybe.

To the gooners in this thread. Does your dick not get sore while you're at it? Or do you not actually wank? I had a big wank last night for an hour or so and even with all the lube I used it was still pretty raw by the end of it. Can't imagine going all day, for multiple reasons

Lad that's nothing. I'm not even a gooner but have gone on 3 hour long seshes. I'm guessing you were sore simply because you don't do it very often.

If you're over the age of 30 and are still overly concerned with your social image and fitting in with others you are either gay, a woman or a manchild that's pathologically stuck in his high school years still

box office trash, hard pass from me. get some actual taste.
<comment>
All I keep thinking about is how I can't do anything with my life. Everyone gets to go to these exciting places and make memories with their friends and girlfriends. How am I meant to just ignore that feel of missing out?
<comment>
Scared a hedgehog by accident while walking home, feel kinda bad about it.
Now i'm home i can't help but think how much i'd like a cute lad to wear girl's clothes and sit on my lap
<comment>
big monsters
big monster fights
big explosions
in IMAX 3D
in the womfy premium seats with extra leg room
all while tucking into some tasty nachos with wheese and walsa dippingtons
Maybe I'm easily pleased but I won't be passing on that. Cheers x
<comment>
Whinge about it on /britfeel/ every day for years, change nothing, that'll make the feeling go away.
<comment>
The hedgehog was a test from God. If you hadn't scared it you would've had a cute lad waiting at home for you, but alas, you terrorised the hog with your clumsy footsteps. You brute!
<comment>
Looks like she noticed the bags under her eyes in another video so now has slammed on the eyeliner. Definitely some confidence issues.
<comment>
That's not what eyeliner is for, lad. Does look daft though.

Fucking love Oreos me, especially the double creme ones.
<comment>
Well I'm sorry I don't know every single bit of clown makeup terminology. It is way overdone. Another thing that bugs me is women who apply fake tan and end up looking worse without it.
<comment>
More makeup than usual to hide the bad skin and acne. Could be a lot of spicy food and takeaways. All those late nights and alcohol parties don't help either.
<comment>
sad wee laddies who won't even get their hair cut or leave the house are judging other people's appearances
<comment>

I did apologise to him
<comment>
I got my hair cut today and it looks and feels good. Keeping clean and tidy is important.
<comment>
If she wants to keep herself looking youthful she will have to stay out of the sun and give up alcohol. I know she drinks alcohol as you can see the bottles left on the table.
<comment>
ayup lads, back from playing a few frames of pool. Fun night, no footie to watch on TV so we had the Snooker on GET IN KYREN WITH THE 147, only the 13th in the Crucibles history. 
Hedgehog'll be fine!
Just gotta live every day as it comes, I know I've made posts on here in a bad state of mind but it happens. Change your name, leave or be a seethie weethie. We all make mistakes in life.
Gotta be posetive about all in life. Set goals lid. Can't go running tommorow cause I'm working all day but I know I'm gonna get back on it next time!
You'll make it through the day without, it's good for you!
Thanks lad, checked those doubles!
<comment>
What are you doing to keep yourself looking youthful?
<comment>
I cut mine recently but don't what to do with it. Do you put it in the bin?
<comment>
Forgot me image, sorry for spamming the thread.
<comment>
I don't drink the alcohol and stay out of sunlight. My eating habits are not great though. I'm not fat thankfully.
<comment>
all while tucking into some tasty nachos with wheese and walsa dippington
Check out rich boy over here
<comment>
And leave the house for what? You don't just go out without a reason to.
<comment>
 GET IN KYREN WITH THE 147, only the 13th in the Crucibles history. 
Tables are faster so it's a lot easier these days. Pockets are also bigger
<comment>
Neither of which will get me a gf so why should I bother?
<comment>
If I ever do it myself, I just cut it in the garden and leave the hair where it is. No big deal as it'll be blown away soon enough anyway. But today I just went to my local barber.
<comment>
Bit of a backlog piled up again there phwoar
Hafta head out in about 8 too, boggles the mind
<comment>
She wants to do a video on renting advice. Yeah good luck with that. She moved here from another country and created more demand for housing. That's why renting is so high. Shocker.
<comment>
Easier maybe but fuckin' 'ell ladm you wanna give it a go? Snooker's a bloody difficult game.
<comment>

You'll make it through the day 
Any more meaningless platitudes for us you boring attention-seeking little twat?
<comment>
I'm well aware how hard it is. 147 just ain't very impressive for a professional these days though. Teenagers are knocking them in and I don't just mean Stan Moody either, but Thai kids on youtube.
<comment>
neighbours furious about some twats greasy hair clippings ending up in the flower pots probably. least put it in the woodburner.
<comment>
I actually buzzed my hair recently and now what? When you don't know anyone, going out is just a waste of money.
<comment>
Go outside with friends is such a deadend normie answer. They presume you have everything they have. Fuck them.
<comment>
Last time I worked was in 2011.
<comment>
Nah we have a big garden which is almost seperate from the house so there's little to no chance the hair blows in any neighbour's way. I would worry about the smell if I burned it.

Why so angry little lid?

Could go for a nightwalk. Gets pretty lonely tho.
<comment>
Gonna shag the fleshlight in 5
<comment>
... And this shit right here is what she *always* blurts out without fail too upon being called out on her bullshit - It just keeps running in circles with the woman really. 
She's like a child repeating the same lazy half-assed excuse time and again when called out, while not really meaning it.
No matter what i do, even when i reflect on her shitty demeanour directly, she just keeps pathologically pulling the same shit over and over. 
Something that's deeply wired wrong in her own brain is driving her to do this. 
Told her the hard boundary regarding the bullshit she keeps pulling is definitely laid now, and it'll be interesting to see whether she will actually keep her (renewed) promise here when/if i end up calling her up again on Friday. 
There's no surefire way of telling how said call (and in addition the relationshit itself) might ultimately end up when she relapses and displays those same patterns once again; But i know what i'll be doing in case she does.
<comment>
We are building up to the breaking up with his imaginary girlfriend and all the conflict that will follow afterwards. Totally and utterly grim life this lad has that he dedicates his time to this nonsense.

We all wungry in life corr
<comment>
Just 'membered randomly when she even got paranoid about my concrete living circumstances and apparently thought i was lying to her about living on my own, lol 
Wanted me to show her actual pictures of the place and everything, which i did when we met up. 
Of course she then didn't even really appreciate this gesture of goodwill and trust-building on my part either - Just quietly checked that off and then down the line/during the call later she went on the same tired old routine again where she starts to suddenly harshly "interrogate" me about assorted shit and asks me about random afflictions she keeps coming up with and thinks i must be hiding from her somehow (from being addicted to alcoholism to whether i was ever diagnosed with this or that). 
I remember right in the beginning she also thought that i was married and must be cheating on my wife with her too, lol.
NO amount of reassurance is enough for this woman, it's incredible and very pathologic really. I'm still rolling with it for now, but just barely

cheers
<comment>
no thats exactly whatvdeacribes you you bizarre freak. marius was right about you.
<comment>
holy fuck dump her then
<comment>
Fink i'll be dumping the gf's ass tomorrow at noon if she pulls any type of this shit again whatsoever, despite my repeated calls and warnings to cease doing so
In fact it's extremely damn likely i'll be doing this, or at least that i'll be throwing down the gauntlet and hand the choice of ending the relationshit to her
After that i can then comfortably lower my standards drastically (since there's no decade-long pressure behind getting me schwong wet again anymore) and move on to a bitch with much lower maintenance - One that will appreciate it too (unlike her sorry soon-to-be eggcel ass)
I've been really fucking patient with her bullshit behaviour (she's even reflected on this herself one or two times, thanking me for it), but she's pushed things to a point now where the effort being put in by me clearly isn't being compensated by any possible future payout anymore
<comment>
Phwoarrrr need to head out for the appointmentshire in less than 2
Befuddles the comprehension
<comment>
Nothing too bad with those nails. Not those horrible, long ones that some girls have. She has a struggle with the pH balance on her skin so gets breakouts frequently. Her hormones will settle down eventually.

Probably going to make this the last appointment at this other pseudo-programme now i'm finking, i'm not even fully sure why i'm turning up there today in the first place besides some opaque sense of obligation from ostensible being in the programme
This whole thing was a giant waste of time overall, all i did during these past three-odd appointments was talk about shit and then sit beside this fat retard watching him scroll thru random web pages for 40 minutes or so 
What a total fucking scam
<comment>
You said you would treat me to a day out at the designer outlet. I need new clothes. Do I look like I want to dress like the common folk round here? Do I have MUG written on my forehead?
*pulls the plug out of the wall*
What did I say about playing video games on a weekend? You broke our golden rule - video games are only on weekdays for one hour after dinner. Since you've let me down, I expect you to be spending another 500 pound on me when we go shopping. Use the credit card. No ifs, no buts... I'm disappointed in you. If you can't step up and handle a relationship then just say so...otherwise shut up and get ready. You're not a mummy's boy anymore. You have responsibilities to make me happy.
<comment>
I've spent one hour looking through Vogue and you've not shown any interest whatsoever. You'd rather sit there and think about some childish game on tv. I did not sign up to date a manchild.

Muslims waiting patiently taking for their turn to take over. French don't want it for cultural reasons, British/German say let's them give them a give go as long as Saudi provides the oil.
<comment>
I'll just say this. Muslims can't take over Eurupe until they take a massive loss. Kosovo doesn't count. They need a massive a loss of life like the rest of us then they can lay claim to this cursed land. Are they willing to do it though?
That's the golden question.
<comment>
I'm willing to give Muslims a chance. If Europe is better off under Islam then so be it.
French are against it but then again I heard the French are racist. So what do we believe?
<comment>
France is pretty cool but it's tainted by Islam ngl. Makes it seem weak af. Do white French kids even exist lmao.

So you're drink again, what happened to fresh start number 136?

I do remember lid. Remember when that French teacher got decapitated for showing a cartoon of Muhammed and liberals had to decide whether they stood with radical Islamists or cartoonists. Loved seeing them squirm.

GOON MORNING LADS.
Spiced up the morning routine today with a bowl of cheerios alongside my wappuccino. Wfh (wank from home) looking to be particularly slow today which is absolutely wonderful in terms of increasing my gooning.
Not sure I'm feeling any particular porn goddess today, so just a general anything-goes goonfest on the cards for me.
Hope you all have great goons today also!
<comment>
Aye so I'm finishing off me wine now. 
Truth is that I'm still far-right as fuck. Lmao bet you expected to me to say I don't care about politics. On the contrary, I fucking hate politically correct liberals and especially those leftists who act like they're so smart and their woke politics will somehow will protect them from Abdul beheading them when the time comes lmao. 
Why am I even making this point? What is this 2016? You already know how this goes.

I'm an experienced remote viewer, I've seen into many timelines. I've looked into the Nazi Britain timelime. After British Free Corps took charge after WW2. John Tyndall takes charge for many years then gives up power to power to Richard Edmonds because of a sex scandal who gives power to Nick Griffin until Jack Renshaw takes over then Sean Allan takes over in 2020.
Seen it all. It's not as exciting as it sounds. It's rather pathetic really. Ends in a American-led invasion of Britain,

I wasn't going to respond to your post, but the phrase balloon knot bumhole reminded me of an old favourite brazzers scene with turbo-MILF nikki benz; it was one of her first if not her actual first anal scene and it was called 'Stretch My Balloon Knot Asshole'. Great scene.

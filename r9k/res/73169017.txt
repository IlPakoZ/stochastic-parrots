It's wack. People will say you just need to try a different source or strain, but that alone says something about it.
I tried multiple sources and even extracts that people claimed were so strong they should be broken in half, but felt nothing on 2 of em. Only felt a little buzz off drinking it one time, but absolutely can't get that nasty stuff down again. Powder in capsules just didn't work for some reason.

You probably took too much but it's not good anyway and makes you lose your hair
<comment>
why is it considered an opiod when you get no opiod buzz?
<comment>
I started low and tried multiple doses

Kava beats the crap out of Kratom IMO. At high doses it is actually euphoric, it's like a big stimulant like dopamine rush combined with Xanax-like sedation.

they also made me sick tf

I'm a white boy who has been taking 50+ grams a day for the past 11 months
I'd used it on and off for years prior but I've never taken it as consistently as I do now

makes you lose your hair
IDK about that, people that report hair loss might have just been 20somes who were naturally going through genetic hairloss and attributed to the kratom instead
I think I'd be bald by now with the amount of this stuff I've used in the past 5 years, but my hair hasn't changed much
<comment>
different person but yeah i have guessed the same, there's probably not a lot of teenagers doing Kratom
<comment>
You took too much if you vomited. It's kind of hard to find the right dose where you feel good, but not sick. 
t. Been taking kratom multiple times a day for over 5 years

Maybe you aren't sensitive to opiates.
I only need 1-2 teaspoons of powder to feel good.
<comment>
why do you guys like it, what does it give you
<comment>
Maybe. Haven't done any others

I think new users have wrong expectations about how this stuff will make you feel. Kratom is basically a drug for people who are trying to stay away from or don't have access to actual drug drugs (useful for lowering your alcohol consumption as well). I've seen it be rated in the same category / family as coffee and can agree that it's not all that much stronger or more intense. Some of the extracts available out there can produce heavier effects but the raw plant matter is pretty mild even if you can stomach a lot of it..It's nice for detoxing or dealing with other withdrawals, it's more something to just keep you afloat and boost your mood than to get high-high

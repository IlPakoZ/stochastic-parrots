Simple as
I dont hate you nonnie
I'm a skinny baby-faced manlet. All women hate me
How babyfaced are we talking? What age would you say you appear to be? :)
I don't hate you. You're just annoying.
see? there is a level of babyfacedom that makes you hate a man. fucking foids brah
No, it's bc some men who claim to be "baby faced" just mean round faced or fat but have wrinkles and receding hairlines. A truly babyfaced man should look like 14
No you hate me
I don't know exactly. Some people have said I look like I'm like 15. I don't think I look that young, but I'm not that good at determining people's age. I'm in my early 20s
If you didn't act like such a dick I would like you again

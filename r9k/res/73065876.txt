Should men be allowed to exist once artificial semen and sex robots are invented?
<comment>
you already have those via sperm banks and vibrators. you can have kids without ever even speaking to a man. its easy as well
for men, we need love and intimacy and sex. we cant get any of that. you can, easily. we cannot
<comment>
Absolutely. I hope men and women start getting along again.

Immortality through the manufacturing of scissiosis efficient human beings and brain transplants is not that far desu.
I see humanity becoming immortal creatures sharing personal achievements and arts while letting AI provide food and shelter before the next 300 years.
Or the elites will keep this all hidden, idk

Those are replacements for men. Why would men need to exist anymore?
<comment>
With the current trajectory of society it is way more likely that the ones to be eradicated in future technological dystopia are men.
This is because men have shown to have lower adaptaptability and compliancy, which are favoured over inventivness and agressiveness in automated and mechanised world of modernity. It is easy to control women, while men opt out of society already merely at a lack of intimacy. Women are meanwhile compliant with all sorts of bullshit and are agreeing to replacing men on male spheres like welding n shit as well.
Additionally, the process of male eradication has already BEGUN. Men are enmasse being medicated into being women, taking dick and cutting off their own. The amount of mtf trannies vastly outnumber ftm. This society has set for itself a straight goal of "female world". Feminine qualities are rewarded, while masculine ones ostracized. Posts like op are pure cope. Sex robots, if tgey will come around will be used merely to distract male brained remains before they just die out as class thanks to social engineering. Using them will remain a thing of shame though, it will only be allowed to you as cope, not as thing if fullfilment.
<comment>
Only in contraptions like these.
<comment>
i dont mind being replaced, but i would like a small home in the middle of nowhere, with an ai gf that looks like this and some corn and pea soup
thats all i want in life. i dont want to reproduce. you can busy yourself with the politics and ethics of eugenics, i care not for it
and its men who suffer the most from inceldom and sexlessness and lovelessness, thats why a moral case for sex-robots exists
<comment>
I already reproduced. You're not missing out on much. Just get an AI chatbot girlfriend and stay at home.
<comment>
Naw, why waste life? They can stick around. 
Let them have cat-fights to get into the harem of some chad of her choice or such. 
Otherwise they are free to work for a sexbot like everyone else, just with a magicwand attached or whatever.

enmasse being medicated into being women
Leave the house sometimes. Troon shits are a loud blight of the web that might as well not even exist for all the fuss and buzz they create
<comment>
men disappear
women too retarded to maintain the technology and society build up by men
regress to the stone age within a week
<comment>
men only destroy shit. they are the ones who caused the stone age in the first place.
<comment>
We should compromise. Men and women should both be allowed to have their waifubots and husbandobots. The age of anime being real will finally be here, hooray
<comment>
caused the stone age
The stone age is the default, which we only escaped by men's inventiveness and hard work
Not replying to you btw, you're just a gaslighting foid that brings up absurd claims on purpose because you cant win honest debates
This reply is to help the more impressionable incels
<comment>
men
hard work
are you retarded or trolling?
<comment>
because the only worthwhile thing women ever create are men, and even that is done at unskilled labor-tier
<comment>
Yes, they should live in concentration camps where they are raped and tortured thier entire lives.
<comment>
all men should be given a delicate lobotomy as children to make sure they grow up with the mental capacity of obedient children. they should be selectively bred for large dicks and castrated after puberty (their sperm will be milked and kept in banks beforehand). universal lesbianism. keep eunuchs as pets/household servants/occasional sex toys to keep you and your gfs love life spicy. having sex with men will be considered as a form of pervy zoophilia which makes it extra transgressive and hot
<comment>
Same applies to black people. They are Hornet Roach Aliens that impregnate fig human-beings to have brother-sister sex and confuse the one true Asian race
<comment>
ummm excuse me moid, hunting animals, toiling away in factories and mines isn't hard work, doing the laundry and feeding kids is
<comment>
for men, we need love and intimacy and sex. we cant get any of that. you can, easily. we cannot
So then stop whining and off yourself. Are you expecting pity-me internet posts to get you love and intimacy and sex?
<comment>
"They caused the stone age"
Caused
This is the ABOVE AVERAGE female brain at work, btw
<comment>
Calling it now, the hands that wrote this post have never needed to hunt for food, or toil in a factory or a mine. Nobody is criticizing men who work, we're criticizing people like you who sit around and shitpost all day.
<comment>
name fag
we're
kys trooner
<comment>
society and technology will be just be maintained by magic
Lol, women are literally mental children
<comment>
men
hard work
can't wait for you dumb fucks to be replaced already.
<comment>
And you do what to maintain society, retard?
<comment>
Abolish the 19th amendment!! (i guess my comment was not original)
<comment>
He's a railroad worker wtf
<comment>
deforestation was caused by men.
<comment>
And it isnt hard to guess who the bitchtit was that complained about the hut being cold all time
<comment>
And we took those trees and throw them into the void so the forest were treeless becuase shaven forest is better than bush forest.
<comment>
it was a man (who had "depression")
<comment>
Nigger, women would benefit the most by the invention of artificial wombs and sex robots because it means we won't have to deal with the hardships of relationships with scrotes anymore, they'd leave us alone. I can't wait for that revolution, personally. I want kids but I don't want to carry them or date men.
<comment>
yes i would like to purchase a robot boyfriend RIGHT NOW
<comment>
All enviromental devestation and resource wars are caused to satisfy foid's need to consoom, men can be happy with little material posessions
<comment>
What exactly do women provide to society other than shitting out kids?
<comment>
men can be happy
lol are you saying most robots are women?
<comment>
Robots aren't interested in endless consoomption, so no
<comment>
Funny you ask this like you're not a basement dwelling NEET who isn't good for anything
<comment>
I can't wait for that revolution, personally.
Get off your ass and become some politician or e-celeb asking loudly for sexbots then. 
Tired af of pussy monopolists fighting the real progress because they fear their attention economy drying out.
<comment>
Funny how you refuse to answer my question
<comment>
But you implied robots are all women
<comment>
Why do you want a cold robot over a real women with actual feelings for you?
<comment>
Why are you talking like sex robots don't exist already it's just uncommon
<comment>
is your foid brain shortcircuiting or something?
Looks like this discussion went beyond your mental limits
Take a break, drink a nice cup of tea and try reading my post again
<comment>
writes an entire paragraph of cope.
<comment>
3 sentences
a paragraph
im sure it looks that way to your foid brain
<comment>
I don't care. It's me who shouldn't be allowed to exist. It would have been merciful if my parents had me aborted. I'm so tired of my constant failures and disappointments. I'm a failure, a defect, a retarded loser, an aberration. But I don't want to die all the same. I want to live.

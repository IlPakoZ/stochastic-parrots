<comment>
its very unoriginal at best

It's because I genuinely hope whoever I tell that to, commits suicide.
<comment>
because no empathy
people on here are a bunch of meanies
<comment>
I treat others the way I want to be treated

You should love yourself...NOW!
Is that more your speed?

Sometimes they're riled up during an argument, or saw a type of poster they don't like. Me personally? I just say it whenever it's funny to do so facetiously

Fuck yeah. KYS (Keep yourself safe)

More than a few things but it's not like I tell people to kill themselves lightly. Generally I reserve that comment for adulterers and abusers.

That is a consequence of being anonymous, people are usually this shitty, but don't say it out loud I think. But let's celebrate it, it is one of the last bastions of mainstream websites that do not censor critical thinking that is not mainstream. Forcing people to say good things is the same as killing freedom of speech. Even if you disagree with Nazis ans psychopaths, it was freedom of speech that gave you the right to think all the thoughts you have now, so we should never shut people up or at least leave a place where they can say as they please. Oh, and don't forget to put a gun inside your mouth an pull the trigger, point to the lower back of your head, it will be painless.

i always see this excuse whenever the shittiness of 4chan is brought up, but i don't believe it's entirely true, the site simply has a culture and history of toxicity and it's known for it, which attracts even worse people to it and a cycle is made, you can find plenty of completely anonymous sites without 4chan's bullshit

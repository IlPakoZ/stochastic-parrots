My gf recently told me she was born male and I honestly feel confused and angry. We've been together for over 4 years. She told me she had the surgery before we ever met and I feel disgusted. The love of my life, the mother of my child, a fucking tranny.
Should I dump her? I don't want to be a faggot dating a troon.

Good job, you realised that this is a bait larp.

Didnt the daily vag widening and voice like a teenage boy give it away?
<comment>
I was a virgin before I met her. It felt pretty real to me.

Could you please explain how did you manage to have a child with neovagina?
<comment>
No no you dont get. I am intrigued to see how he will further navigate the story.
Op, give explanation to having a child with tranny NOW
<comment>
Look, I don't know the inner workings of her trickery. All I know is that I fucked her, she gained weight and a suprisingly brown baby came out.

I think you are mistaking a piece of poop for a child. Get a psychiatrist.

See, if I had been OP, I would've been.
"Sorry guys, emotional and rushed things. I meant the woman I saw as the mother of my future children."

you should throw him/her off a bridge for birthing a child out of its butthole (witchcraft)
<comment>
I can't bring myself to do that. I still love her.

I already explained.

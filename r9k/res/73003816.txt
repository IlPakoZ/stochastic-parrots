<comment>
Don't post the webm, a certain bespectacled chubster doesn't like it
<comment>
ssm completely wiped 2 of his youtube channels
bollocks possibly done in
<comment>
Didnt he say he was leaving YouTube for TikTok?
<comment>
Sainsbury's? I've had a friend complain about that recently too.
<comment>
Oh no what will you do with your life now? 
Talk to your mum for the first time this year? Step foot outside for the first time this decade?
<comment>
talking to my mum? won't get me a gf
<comment>
posting the newsnight webm? wont get me a gf
<comment>
SSM has a better life than you and this makes you seethe
<comment>
That's a big hoIe
<comment>
Most lads here would kill to have a girlfriend, but I'm embarrassed about having one. Not of her, but the concept of having one. No I'm not gay. Just shy
<comment>
Get in deerre my leedingtons
<comment>
The trick to getting a girlfriend is to tell women you suffer from TMAU. It worked for seasideMARK.

He bored with Tiktok. No more Tiktok for him my leeed. IT's youtube all the way. Too many messages. He only wants about 1000 subscribers it not about quantity its about subscribers.
He had 800,000 views. He had over a million views on Tiktok. He reached the top. One of his videos went over 800,000. That's enough for him he went big, he had that taste of fame, right steak and Stilton pie all the way.
It's YouTube all the way
<comment>
Gaaaarrrrrnnn Are Mark always had morals and a clear vision. He not going to go after mr beast he's happy at basecamp keeping all the young bucks entertained carving out his slice of the action on the youtubes. He proper grafter knows exactly what he wants.
<comment>
Something must have happened because he was hyped about tiktok the other day
<comment>
I have a suggestion, if the kindly folks from britfeel would take a moment out of their busy schedules. 
Boners.
<comment>
He woulda realised people are getting bored of his repetitive stuff. He can either try find a new angle, improve it or quit. He hit a brick wall R KID
<comment>
He achieved his vison, he made the Seaside Dream a reality to almost a million young Zoomers.
HE not on here to make money, he here to make smiles, he here to a bit of acting. Maybe one day someone spot him and he become an actor. His heart set on bringing joy to the lads. He the next Tim Curry x
cheers x
<comment>
Tiktokkerz are ruthless they will call you out nonstop if they realise youre lame. Most tiktok stars act stupid but are secretly smart or they have a 'talent manager' which is basically someone that stays with them 24/7, curates all their content and make sure their low IQ doesnt blow it for them. One cringe mistake can set you back months or years or kill your channel. The talent managers are the unsung heroes they break their backs making sure the stupid ones dont do anything stupid
1 Direction were under 24/7 guard in their hotel rooms to make sure they could never go out and meet girls and probably get done for sexual abuse or get them pregnant or whatever woulda happened.
<comment>
DWP Nanny was not happy with SSM's TikTok career
<comment>
Quite funny to think about. 'Talent manager' is basically a tard wrangler worded nicely
<comment>
R MARK should go back to his insights on AI in his poetry musings. He was onto something big there. Was getting worldwide acclaim from some legitimate organisations
<comment>
Him getting a hint of acclaim is what ruins him, he immediately starts thinking about how he'll make thousands of pounds so starts playing up to the character 
He needs to realise: his real 'fans' actually HATE him. They like him being a fat, miserable waste of space. That's why he got sent loads of sugary goods today, they want him eating it all, getting fatter and hating himself more
<comment>
Glad I got my first ever reply from FBR. He is treasure we plundered from /deutsch/
<comment>
whats he doing posting in britfeel when hes not british. I always thought the appeal of posting here is purely because we bri'ish. Dont like these transient types who latch onto anything. theyd be useless in a combat situation
<comment>
Doubt he cares less about britfeel 
He used to post in the feelsbar thread on /r9k/ but that isn't a regular general
<comment>
he just uses this place as a journal.
<comment>
Embarrassed about what? Or do you mean just shy infront of girls, cause I understand that, I can't look females in the eye.
<comment>
not good lads, my internet is playing up. very slow all of a sudden
<comment>
get in thereeeee my leeeeeed
<comment>
What do you lads think on fitness and general health?
Do you try and eat healthy and that, or do you just think fuck it?
<comment>
don't care, who the fuck am i trying to impress as a perma shutin neet.
<comment>
I think its very important, but the problem is us losers really struggle to spend all day not eating like apu's and also spending an hour or two doing activities that progress your life.
Turns out though if a lot of us did it we'd be a completely different person within 2 years. But we're too depressed to do it. Many have completely resigned and wont even consider it as an option because they think its vain and stupid with all the depression thoughts. 
Its a fucked up situation isnt it R KID. Strokin my fat belly as I type this out
<comment>
told my parents i'm going to work tomorrow but i'm getting the train to the city at lunch time.
i'm going to watch a couple classic movies at the cinema, get some michelin star food, then go home for 10pm.
i should message one of the sexy 18yo alt girls who i keep matching with on tinder but i'm not about that social malarkey :)
<comment>
Pretty much me, mate
I've had a gym sub now for about 2 years and I constantly switch mindsets.
Part of me thinks going to the gym is literally my only social reach into finding a partner, tho deep down I know its pretty delusional to think so.
I think looking better would be nice too, but I have a horribly hooked nose and receding hairline. Something no amount of working out will fix.
Plus I like chocolate and shit too much.
<comment>
phwoar was eating pretty good until last night, went to the shops for some snacks...
ended up getting a bag of milkybar buttons and some san pellegrino. Then i popped into the pizza shop and got a parmo wrap and a 1/2lb cheesburger. was all shite, but whatever.

Everyone want real progress.

<comment>
Need a HHL spacker shower update
<comment>
Back in the day, I used to consider Ebin the most relatable person I'd ever come across, but now I think Soundspacker (FBR) may have usurped him in that regard.
<comment>
If you are genuinely wanting to get into anal play start small and build up 
it is extremely easy to bugger your arse and rupture it haha 
so just use plugs and lots of lube see how you get on with the biggest plug after building up and then get a regular dislocated not too big or girth and fuck your self with it 
:) 
I use plugs to warm up then a smaller dildo then I move onto my bbc one and go wild
<comment>
This cunt posting grim tranny porn and schizo bollocks has wrecked the thread

<comment>
The key is never, never work. Nothing is more aging than work. It's not only the strain of getting up in the morning for work, but it's the resentment that settles on your face
<comment>

<comment>
Makes me laugh seeing the picture of my fat apu in his concrete box, everytime. Its so silly and cute gives me brumper fun energy. Hes having so much fun in his concrete box! Just look at him go! Hes a fucking nutter! >>73005525
I get how kids play with legos now when you invest time into something stupid you start to get enjoyment out of it. As far as im concerned my apu is real. (Because he is)
<comment>
Was scared for R helperlid when everyone was ganging up on him after a bender. Was talking him out of it because hes R KID
<comment>
I'm glad SSM turned his back on tiktok. He was becoming unbearable with all the repetition. 
He also said he wont be posting any more videos with Helen. I bet she said something to him kek
<comment>
SSME probably started posting on his TikTok videos and he didn't know how to moderate it so just deleted everything
<comment>
I am going to try my best not to lad, cheers for the support.
<comment>
Imagine being a 40 odd year old woman and MARK is walking around saying " 'old en 'elen need to make a viral video dunt 'a " 
im eating fish n chips, im eating fish n chips ant a, eating fish and chips Wow! Im eating fish and chips! Fish and chips ive got fish and chips 'ant 'a!" and then recording 5 more variants of it to stitch together. I believe its known as the 'ick' to women. It'd be like watching a toddler wandering around. Hes too slow to realise how the game works and it's a bit sad watching him chase that high of his viral tiktok. Eventually you have to let him know gently that hes not onto the winner. It probably led to a big argument. Sounds stupid but its a pivotal moment in his life. He found more exposure than hes ever found in his 10+ years of making videos. When you look at it in that light he probably made an enormous deal out of it and it probably took up a lot of time, thoughts and all that. And when its not going right you need to sit him down. Gotta pull him around R KIDS
<comment>
Still cant believe people like SSME exist. He lives to bully someone he can latch onto as inferior. Hes so fucking boring and insidiuous he has to beat up the toddler in front of him. Fucking HATE HIM!
<comment>
just got a new matress and some real silk (100% polyester) sheets.
Very comfy, cant wait till beddington.
<comment>
Has SSME done auditing yet? I bet hes too pussy to do it but he obviously wants to. Paints a real story that he's willing to drive down to marks house to harass him (knowing he will shit himself and wont confront him) but wont go harass random fat blokes working for SPACCA logistics. Hes a true coward
<comment>
Back from playing me poolington, won some, lost some. 
It's all the run of the ball.
<comment>
SSME seems to have retired now. He could not defeat the mighty SSM!
<comment>
AM IN FOOKIN WAREHAM TRAIN STATION WAITING FOR MARKHH BUT HES NOT HERE.
If mark actually turned up in retard mode he'd shit himself. But he knew he wouldnt. Makes it all the more rat like that he went down with this in mind. What is it with bullies always being RATS. They always look like rats as well. Its weird. They are little vermin creatures larping as humans its crazy
<comment>
Why are there no SSM gifs on the normie gif search things in messaging apps?
<comment>
He went to Mark's house after Mark was giving it the 'come fuckin raaand' and Mark was cowering behind the sofa. The police were called. 
We all know this, yet you somehow don't and you're obsessed with the smelly fat cunt.
<comment>
I know, there should be desu. I might make some gifs and webms tomorrow
<comment>
I might
You won't 
You didn't even make that one
<comment>
Home from work and once again trying to manifest a cute lad to dress like a girl and sit on my lap
<comment>
I can't remember if I made that webm but half of the SSM pics re-posted I made
<comment>
Link to the video little lad? You wont

If you work somewhere with a Krispy Kreme and get to know the staff, you'll find out they bin hundreds of donuts every night. So if you stop by before close they'll give you as many as you want.

Get multiple personality disorder and audit yourself

The year is 2013, and Sammy has only recently explained to her 12-year-old son the truth about what happened and how he was conceived - how the man he called dad, Arshid Hussain, had raped and abused her from when she was 14. He groomed her to believe they were in a relationship. Hussain, who was 24, did the same to many other girls too.
And you can't even get a girlfriend. They'd rather be groomed by Hussains and Azhars.

<comment>
This messes the auditor's gameplan up so much. They're so used to getting a reaction. They crave getting the content and when no one makes a fool of themselves, they try to save face. Luckily for them a good majority of this country's working class cannot contain their feelings/egos and will lash out. That's why they seem to target easy places like warehouses, jobcentres and police stations. I'm surprised he'd upload such footage...maybe he thinks he "won" the battle.
Shame he'll never come back.

I'm too much of a hateful person now to ever be liked by girls. I feel like the crippling loneliness drove me to being a nasty person. I don't think it's possible to even improve at this point. I'd still be seen as a loser if I started working in a mundane job.
<comment>
I have to remind myself there are horrible Chads who get relationships because of their looks and manipulative tactics. Women stick to being in abusive relationships all the time. They see anyone that isn't really attractive as a loser.

At least you realise it there are thousands of people walking around abusing others while think they're the victim

Hi britanons. Hope I'm not intruding
If anyone's from the Northumbria area, what's it like?
Part of my family emigrated from there in the 1680s. Wondering how you anons are doing now
Alternatively, what is the image of that region in the eyes of British people?
Thanks,

<comment>
Just busted a big fat ol' nuttinghamshire to the pic the gf sent over earlier in the evening 
Extremely nice to reminisce on the fact i got to tap that so many times
<comment>
1st time meeting up w/the gf - I haphazardly manage to see the whole thing across; Was completely lost in [redacted] at first without any maps or internet access, somehow managed to get to the hotel against all odds with no reception and just by asking random asf people i come across on the street for directions
This felt intensely surreal to me at first and very much like i was a character being spat out from a comfy tutorial area (the hi-speed train) into the unforgiving actual world map (the city of [redacted]) - Yet at the same time i knew exactly how crucial and decisive what i was doing actually was for myself and the path i was forging, so i just kept pushing ahead
2nd time around i now actually knew how to (immediately) get reception at the place and how to get around on foot, studied all the route(s) i need to traverse and all, don't need to ask anyone for directions whatsoever and generally have a much better hang of the city and its layout + flair (the [redacted] is much better now too])
Ironically enough this was also the last time we'd be able to meet up there
If this prospective 3rd time actually takes shape/place now i will have to take a more or less insane journey spanning at least [redacted] hours and [redacted] on me; An incredibly ambitious (compared to what came before) and - probably - also fairly dangerous gamble considering overall circumstances
This is still only mostly a psychological barrier i need to cross thoughbeit, since the actual physical and financial effort to get to my destination would be fairly low, all things considered
It really is comical sometimes how much life (and in extension, general existence within physicality) for the non-NPC resembles a vidya game where one constantly levels up by stepping out of one's comfort zone/secured abilities and grinding experience out in the wide world in order to grow as a character, lol
It's exactly intended to be this way too, funnily enough. God's sense of humour is nice

Eurgh got a hangover and have to do a lot of work today. Not a good start to my Wednesday. 
Will be getting out of the bed fortress shortly, need to wash off the dried lube from yesterday's big wank session (gf away so could watch my questionable porn on the lounge TV) and then get some baked beans, got a desperate hankering for some beany boys this morn
<comment>
Was funny how the gf indirectly admitted to secretely going through all my stuff earlier too, lol
Like, she somehow found a way of telling me she did this and overstepped this line without actually outright admitting to it. Fucking sneaky immature femoid behaviour right there
Most everything she keeps "interrogating" me about over and over again is some sort of paranoid projection on her part too of course. Definitely has a ton of emotional damage/baggage and somewhat of a past "she's not telling me about" (exactly what she says i'm doing lol), what with her shit nagging personality and constant trust/commitment issues and all that. 
But the pussy is just too damn good for me to just pass up in the end here, and she knows it too heh

Who is doggerbreh?

What a vile thing to do, falsely tell your children they were conceived from rape (they weren't). Has clearly harmed them
<comment>
Robby Illig, the family dog
Soundspacker feeds him with pretzel sticks, sometimes followed by Doggerbreh sharting in the bed heh
<comment>
So FBR is extremely based, and often speaks of (((moneylenders))) although his family has a menorah and flag of Israel, what's up with that?

These gazillion fockin hurdles i need to jump thru to get to this destination piss me the fuck off really

GOON MORNING LADS!
Another day another goon sesh to melt my brains. Logged in to my wfh (wank from home) laptop a whole four minutes early so they think I'm really going the extra mile instead of gooning my fucking brains away the entire working day lmao!
Anyway, feeling like Katja Kassin is the woman for me today. Such a fucking thick short pancake stack of booty and a metric TON of anal scenes under her belt, plenty of IR as well. What a goddess!
What are the lads gooning to today?
<comment>
I was insulting him, saying he socks off horses. My great grandfather died in the battle of the somme. I don't know what he'd think.
What about this, our dead ancestors look at the world and think, wtf was the point in fighting the Germans? The western world is worse off, full of degenerates running the countries, allowing depravity to corrupt children.
<comment>
My grandfather didn't die for this.

Your grandad quite literally did die for my right to goon my brains out. We can argue over whether or not that was a good thing to die for, but those are the facts lad.

What does your wank from home job entail? I mean I know you're gooning all day, but what do the mugs that are paying you think you're doing?
I get it fairly easy when WFH and sometimes have a cheeky wank, but I do need to be constantly available for calls and need to keep on top of the emails and teams messages.
<comment>
I do third party editorial work for a contractor company. Basically when some random publisher is too retarded to screen the manuscripts themselves they send it through to my company and it gets assigned to one of us. Work comes in dribs and drabs and most of the time I don't even read the manuscript I just send them one of the prewritten emails I have saved with whatever somewhat vague justifications for the decision which I randomly make. Beyond that there's some minor general admin stuff that I can bash out in 20 mins in the morning, but no big regular meetings. Only if a manuscript comes through marked IMPORTANT do I actually properly read it and make a decision on it, but those are fairly rare.
Can't believe this pays more than when I was on a non-contractor job. There is no way this can last forever, surely not. I have it so fucking good right now, I've never gooned as much in my life than since I started this job about 20 months ago.

If you play it at 0.75 speed you can hear what he's actually saying
One day I stink of shit, and one day I stink of shit
He can't even get his own disability right
<comment>
They're both annoying but I disagree. At least SSM is vaguely relevant in that he's a fat disgusting alcoholic dosser like many posters here, and sometimes does something retarded enough to be funny. Goonmongs are literally just porn spammers, and they don't even post good porn.

at any rate he does his job like we all do. no such thing as money in the Republic of England, but we all get our food vouchers. is it true some of yous have 'more food' or 'less food'? seems absurd tbqh.

You lads know that Black Youth in the US who Dindu Nothing and was Going To Church so that he could Turn His Life Around and was Doing Well In School, who got shot by an 80 year old man on the elderly man's front porch?
Turns out this was him:
https://files.catbox.moe/5forvq.mp4
It's amazing how literally no articles even mentioned that he was carrying a large mag semi-auto carbine while trying to pry the guy's door open. I guess if an 80 year old man sees a stranger with a gun trying to get into his house he might think he's in danger and decide to defend himself.
Nah, actually it was just racism. The old man was a nazi or something.

I think I've made up my mind to kill myself. I've lost the will to continue. Is there any reason I shouldn't, anons?

You know, it's funny. I used to have hope. A very near friend to me convinced me everything would be okay one day. He was my best friend, and I believed him. But as always, nature rips apart all cruel delusions. I simply have no interest in this world anymore. I'm done.

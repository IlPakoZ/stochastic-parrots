I can never get dates on Tinder. I have been trying for years. One thing I did when I was 23 was workout and plan to post shirtless pics. I never came to do that. I am 28 now and I am working out again after going on and off the past 5 years. I have heard that 30 year olds pull 18 year olds easily. If I am at 3 plate bench, will I pull a decent looking girl to be my girlfriend for a few months? I will post shirtless pics this time and I feel good about it. I'm on a journey to become a pro at Tinder.
congrats man, sounds like youre bettering yourself (:

lolno, if you couldn't pull when you were their age, you'll have trouble pulling no matter how jacked you are at 30. 
You can probably get some matches with women (2-5% match rate) in their early to mid 20s though if you use a lot of dark lighting on your face.
I also want to look good so me and my friend can go to bars and have a better time than being skeles. Summer is right around the corner and there are memories to be made with hot girls in the picture this time.

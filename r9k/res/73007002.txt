tfw go through the motions of life but don't have any emotional response or attachment to any of the events so it's like nothing happened at all
it's almost like I vaguely remember it from a movie or hearing about it happening to someone else
even have a gf but even the things I do with her I can't "feel" them
Am I too far gone? I know I use to have feels, but where did they go? How can I find them again?

same, I stopped feeling anything about a year ago. It's like I'm watching my life play out through a TV, where I can watch but don't really have any input. 
I don't know what happened honestly.

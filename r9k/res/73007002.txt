Am I too far gone? I know I use to have feels, but where did they go? How can I find them again?
same, I stopped feeling anything about a year ago. It's like I'm watching my life play out through a TV, where I can watch but don't really have any input. 
I don't know what happened honestly.
I WANT TO HEAL
I WANT TO FEEL

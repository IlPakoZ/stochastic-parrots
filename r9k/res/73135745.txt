I married a woman with BPD and my life has since been utter hell. Have any other anons had experience with women with BPD? If so, can we talk about it?

BPD is a made up condition thats literally just how most women are. Stop being a pussy And stand up for yourself.

BPD just makes women a little moody. You probably struggle with your own mental disorders and that's why you can't handle it.

LOL you might very well be unironically correct in that, anon. Lord forgive me for my ignorance. This is my superficial torment. The funny thing is, her family is extremely religious and loves me. But she hates me every monday, wednesday and friday.

But she hates me every monday, wednesday and friday.
So avoid her on those days and leave presents with little notes for her

Get plates thrown at your face when you are calm.
My mother never did that, did yours? 
So who do I fuck on tuesdays, thursdays and weekends?

your mother did that to her husband because your mother was a grotesque whore retard bimbo cumslut. half a million men fucked your mother. they fucked her orally, they fucked her vaginally, they fucked her anally. they pissed and shitted on your mother, in your mother. they farted stinky gas in your mother's face. they spit on your mother.

stop abusing her then, and she won't abuse you back. simple as. her abuse is no doubt reactive abuse from being abused.

I've been chatting with a BPD fembot for the last month. She's a little desperate and overly flirty too soon but beyond that I don't see the fuss. How long does it take for it to become hell because I might date this girl.

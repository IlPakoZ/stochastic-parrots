A fat woman's mind is downgraded to the flesh, no humanity or sense of thought. Just a flesh toy who's mind is lost in the presence of pleasure. Who's soul is too weak to pursue beyond natural instincts. Her sense of right and wrong can and will be easily changed through promise of extreme pleasure. I deserve not an actual human, half of this board is not deserving of a human. The soulless and depraved shall forever be cursed thanks to their predecessors, our predecessors. And should be placed in a ghetto, castrated, and segregated in secular zones from the least niggered to the most. In a way, Hitler was right besides the racial realism. The entire notion of subhumans is true. As a subhuman I advocate for eugenics. Holding men and women both equally responsible. This is the flaw of ariosophy, they only wanted the men to be held accountable. It goes both ways NIGGER

Bmi over 23 is fat. Fat women are worthless and should be chained to a wall somewhere out of sight and starved until they are a human size again.

You mean over 25.
I'm 23.1 BMI and look jacked.

It's different for men since we carry more muscle. Women shouldn't be over 23 and even below that can be chubby.

Agree with you on this part, but as a fat fetishist I want to see them funnel fed until they reach unreal sizes.

you're either jacked or you're not. if you are, disregard bmi. if you just think you look it without ever having put in the work, stop deluding yourself.
if depends on the person but many people who are considered 'healthy' bmis do look fat.

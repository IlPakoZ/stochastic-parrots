To Women,
I resent you. You talk dress and act like a mannish ogre and the only thing that you can think of to exhibit any femininity at all (a word you very likely don't even know the meaning of anymore) is just by trying to be a slut. That's it. You can't figure out what being a woman means other than being a whore. Do you ever wonder about this huge list of human defects you exhibit, and do you ever wonder if that's actually your fault? I'm just wondering because nothing in your entire life, no matter how obviously it is really your fault, seems to be in your own eyes. You are an unnecessarily rude, inconsiderate ogre whore advertising your body to justify being called a woman. You are a failure being sustained by fake praise.

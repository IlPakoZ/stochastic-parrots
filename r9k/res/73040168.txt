Why pretty girls are so insecure or full of issues and traumas?
constant validation 
attention seeking 
jealous 
easily influenced by others opinions 
daddy issues 
some fuck up
I'm not saying ugly girls don't have this too but is almost a rule for pretty girls have any of above

This is applicable to most people. Especially insecurity. You're just seeing it only in pretty girls because you're a sour faggot that wishes he could get laid.

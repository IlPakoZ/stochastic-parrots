this is the 2023 looks match
It's fucking over 
I've tried using dating apps to find a girl and I only match with 1-2/10 girls as a 6-7/10 guy.
I've tried going out irl to meets girls but everywhere I go has a 3:1 male to female gender ratio, and the woman are all ready infatuated with other guys and just ignore me when I get there. 
It's
Fucking 
Over 
I'm in the early stages of planning suicide already.

Even modern-day chubby chasers can't catch a break because fat ladies have become stuck-up and Chadsexual now

Obese whales are a niche. That dude has a feederism fetish. As long as you are a normalfag you'll make it.

TFW got ghosted by a fat 60yo who suggested she was DTF in the beginning.

Lmao HOW???
I only get attention from mutant pig women, any normal girl is long funcing gone in Chad's haram.

You have to be a social butterfly and have at least 10k followers on instagram and 1000 friends on facebook. Going on tinder as a nobody is like expecting a man to marry a bald woman with no tits and a hankhill ass. Normiemaxxing is the only way out.

God I wish I had a 1-2/10 gf

You people are delusional:
go on tinder
have a GOOD (and I mean good, like hard to get right) pic of mostly your face/upper body as first pic, eyes lookong at camera, doesn't look too tryhard/staged/desperate
at least 5 other pics of you doing stuff, have a funny one and one with friends in there
actually chat matches up and don't beat about the bush like a fuckwit
suggest a date/meeting tonight soon in as soon as you see an opportunity to segue into that (can pay to ask what they're looking for first if it isn't obvious)
you should be good
Good way to use Tinder is:
don't swipe that much, wait for likes then match with them
only match during peak hours/when it says they're online, the biggest reason you get no response/ghosted is being swept to the bottom of her chat pile by others when you time it badly

I just wanna fall asleep on her belly while she strokes my hair, it looks so soft like a pillow.

You have the wrong idea about us. Most of the people here are friendless losers and even getting good pictures is a challenge.
have a GOOD (and I mean good, like hard to get right) pic of mostly your face/upper body as first pic, eyes lookong at camera, doesn't look too tryhard/staged/desperate
This sounds like I have to set up a camera and find the right angle, distance and sunlight. And trying multiple poses. Or I could be like a Chad and just hire a photographer.
 >at least 5 other pics of you doing stuff, have a funny one and one with friends in there
I don't have friends.

And then suddenly, on the first date, she realizes you're an incel from your shitty social skills. Looks and height are amazing, but not being socialized into normiehood will ruin all your chances. Also she'll want your social media and your loser-ish accounts will make her dry up.

i'm so fucking defeated. my looksmatch is obese and is barely sociable. i tried talking to her and despite making a good connection and having the same interests, she already has a bf who height mogs me. how are you supposed to keep going when its clearly over.

Why are Chudcels so uncomfortable with the thought women are sexual beings and had partners before them?
<comment>
Because they don't see women as people, but rather sex objects akin to actors in pornography (in their minds)
<comment>
The same reason you wouldn't buy a car with 150,000 miles at full-price.
<comment>
Why do used products cost less than new ones?
And yes, women are objects, not people. It's not my fault someone decided to make them larp as people because of some political fad a hundred years ago.
<comment>
I want to have a sense of ownership over my partners body and knowing she saved her virginity for me would make me really happy. I see no other reason to have a romantic relatuonship otherwise.
<comment>
I don't, then again not sure if I'd really be classified as any sort of cel, other than for a quick insult.
I'm fine with 2-3 partners, it's just that 10-15 by the time you're 30 seems to be "normal" or even "far less" for women today.
My ex at 23 apparently believed 6 guys was below average for her age
<comment>
Just to clarify, the main issue is that women (probably men too for that matter) don't really seem capable of holding down a stable long term relationship after that many partners.
Or rather the opposite-having that many partners is a sign that you can't hold down a long term relationship
<comment>
I don't think that deeply about it I just think dating a non-virgin would be gross so I just go with my feelings.
<comment>
Same reason women dislike the fact that men are sexual beings and had sex with prostitutes before them.

this and based also same
<comment>
Eh no, women consider a high body count flattering for a male.
<comment>
The problem with high body counts is that I wasn't a part of them. If I were the gateway that stacies had to pass through to continue their whoring, I'd probably have a whole different set of problems, but at least I wouldn't whine about not getting laid all the time.
<comment>
You shouldn't laughable t people man, it makes them feel bad. And I honestly believe people who go out of there way to treat others badly deserve a place in hell.
<comment>
because its nasty and disgusting and repulsive
the thought of catching feelings for a used up whore
a girl who blew other men
a girl who fucked men on the first day she met them
a girl who experienced all kinds of love with other men
its so fucking disgusting and repulsive. all men feel this way, its just that they are so desperate for pussy they just tolerate it. they all would prefer virginal teenage gf's, but settle with used up whores
the incels who speak up about this are the only people who even admit to this
<comment>
Not if it was with prostitutes.
<comment>
And I honestly believe people who go out of there way to treat others badly deserve a place in hell
shut the fuck up moralfagging hypocrite retard
do you eat meat? because i can guarantee you that if you eat meat you are like a billion times worse than people who laugh at others
you are saying experiencing PLEASURE is immoral because it hurts your faggot feelings. its so tilting when peopel hold such braindamaged opinions
holy fucking SHIT you are stupid, and its tilting to know theres so many of you retards out there, saying this braindamaged shit
schaudenfreud is not immoral, you FUCKING RETARD. its an emotion. you are trying to morally criminalize THOUGHTS, you fucking retard. like, close your eyes, and imagine someone you hate falling down the stairs, and smile at that thought. thats what shaudenfreud is. you are literally saying that experiencing joy is immoral
you FUCKING RETARD. honestly\
if you dont like getting roasted online, then leave. literally go somewhere else. clsoe your eyes or turn off the monitor
<comment>
It's because it means they will be compared to past sexual partners and they fear not being able to measure up. They lack confidence in their own masculinity.
<comment>
Everyone always says this but it's just a roastie cope. Whores are just gross, that's all really.
<comment>
No, it's because we don't want to ever run into some dude who fucked our girl and not be able to fucking murder him on the spot.
<comment>
i think theres a lot of truth to that. a lot of girls are permanently ruined by chad, and men cant accept it. they cant accept that they cant hold a candle to men who are good at sex and romance and passionate lovemaking
and its a sad existence. to be aware that your partner is repulsed by you sexually, and just acts and lies to you. its honestly a pathetic way of living, and a great many men live like this
incelTV made a video about this, being a betabux to a used up whore. its really sad
its better to be a incel virgin that live like that

<comment>
Its because they are super insecure.
<comment>
eating meat is worse than laughing at others
Cope
So let me get this right you're some mentally ill vegan who cares about wild animals more than you do your fellow man and now you're raging like a spastic retard projecting all your insecurities off on others lol
I was right about you, you will probably go to hell, the only sad part about it is you are obviously mentally incognicent and unself aware to the point you probably don't know what you did wrong lol. You qre the absolute scum of the earth and I hope the next person you laugh at follows you home kills you(if youre a woman rapes you first) and never gets caught. Asswipe. Lmao
<comment>
Chud here. I'm homophobic, sexist, a religious fundamentalist, transphobic, etc. I honestly don't care if a girl's a slut with a high body count; sluts tend to be hot and good at sex. I don't really care what political views a woman has either because I've accepted women's political opinions are irrelevant to the march of society.
I'm more concerned with if she can actually stay monogamous with me. And sluts are absolutely capable of keeping their legs closed if you give them a chance and aren't a social retard.
<comment>
this is why im waiting for marriage to have sex
<comment>
who cares about wild animals more than you do your fellow man
yes. i hate people. i really do
and i dont cause harm to you by laughing at you. if i laughed at someone, i dont cause harm to them. if someone falls down the stairs, and i laugh, i didnt cause them to fall down the stairs. i just experienced an emotion of joy
but when you eat meat, you CAUSE animals to die. hence the hypocrisy and your braindamaged moral takes. dogshit moral takes, based on your irrational emotions
you will probably go to hell
why? persumeably you think people who are evil or immoral should go to hell. why is it the case that i ought go to hell? 
because i enjoy laughing at people's misfortunes, or insultig them?
basically you think people should burn in hell for anything that offends you? do you think this is a respectable position?
You qre the absolute scum of the earth
why? because i laugh at people and i think hurting animals is wrong?
fucking retard
<comment>
men who are good at sex
good at sex
In the image you yourself posted the roastie says that even though her current boyfriend is actually better at sex, giving oral and using his fingers and everything, her chad ex just jackhammered her and that was enough because of gina tingles and bigger dick, all of which he was born with. In fact, most fuckboys and manwhores arent actually good at sex, you often see many women complaining that they dont orgasm from casual sex, because if youre just going to pump and dump a whore you generally dont give a shit whether she gets hers or not. Women like sex with chad because of the mental image and satisfaction of being with someone out of their league, because they are women and they dont understand that being used as a wet hole isnt hard. And sometimes yes, chad is good at sex, but actually communicating with a monogamous partner you are romantically attracted to is much better for sex skill than randomly fucking random whores or men.
<comment>
yea women get vagina tingle from feeling like they are fucking an important guy (aka a guy all her friends want to fuck) more than anything
<comment>
crying
more crying
cries about he's a mentally ill faggot with abandonment issues
Lol pussies like you shouldn't be laughing at anyone, you would be more concerned with getting your mental issues in order you need therapy counseling and like 20 something different psychiatric drugs before you're ready to be re intrigued into civil societies
I enjoy laughing at people's misfortunes
But that's not gonna fix your own lol, people are just going to treat you like a worthless dick head and if anything probably just feel pitty for you because you honestly come across as someone who probably looks odd and doesn't fit in, I wouldn't be surprised if you just laugh at people as a defense mechanism because you know they are looking down on you lol pathetic
I'm going to hell cause I'm evil
You're probably going to go to hell because you're a POS that's where most of you go and it probably won't bother you since animals don't have souls and don't go to heaven lol
laughing at people is wrong and hurting animals is ok
Laughing at people is wrong because human beings are my brothers and people do it to make them feel bad. Killing animals for food is nesecary every species does it, humans with divine purpose for good practice should do it. Can you prove animals hurtthough? Have you ever had an animal tell you it was in pain? Not that it matters.
<comment>
Because women who sleep around turn mentally handicapped
<comment>
Very true, although I think the same is true for men too.
<comment>
I would still fuck a nonvirgin, but I would never go down on her or be really tender with her
<comment>
Women should have their limbs amputated and be used as incubators for Chudlets.
<comment>
My gf at 22 has had 5 including me, whats the verdict
<comment>
women objectify men more than men objectify women. Women objectify themselves more than men objectify them.
<comment>
you are temporarily using a public asset, she is not your girlfriend
<comment>
women are sexual beings
What does this even mean
<comment>
sexual beings and had partners before them?
For some value of 'partners', ie. hookups and one-night-stands.
I don't personally care if you're a cumdumpster, just don't expect a commitment from me is all. If you can have standards, so can I.
<comment>
The irony is that I'm not an incel chud and that has made me more devout in my no hymen no diamond stance rather than less.
If you're socially well adjusted, you see the full extent of how slutty women are these days. Seeing it first hand hits different than reading about it online.
It's not that incel chuds are more picky about virginity, it's that they're the only ones dumb and unaware enough to talk about it. Nothing good comes of telling girls that you want virgins.
<comment>
That's because it is, not just gross but also tells a lot about the person. A person who has sex before marriage is a untrustworthy cunt, regardless of gender. they will NOT leave a single chance in future to get their dicks wet or pussy destroyed. remember, you are the one who is correct, not these filthy cucklords trying to spread their psyop.
<comment>
Purity has been a sociological and psychological mechanism for men to guarantee the genetic makeup of the offspring they father.
Before paternity tests (which are still currently both made difficult and are being campaigned against because it 'hurts women') men had no way of telling their children were theirs or not besides glaringly obvious physical traits.
In 1999 the American Association of Blood Banks that found that in 30 percent of 280,000 blood tests performed to determine paternity, the man tested was not the biological father.
I wouldn't be surprised if that's closer to 50% now with our current marriage-less culture.
<comment>
I don't care if she's had a few long term relationships but casual sex and FWB type relationships are fucking gross.
<comment>
To add to this, they've even outlawed paternity tests in countries like France to "protect the peace of families" due to the high rates of infidelity.
<comment>
Even that is overthinking, people bring up statistics or hypocrisies and stuff but to me, the thought of dating a non-virgin is gross but so is the thought of fucking some stranger, so waiting for marriage with another virgin makes the most sense. What I don't get is why people get so upset about people's personal preferences for dating. Even with women who say they don't want men under 6' or whatever, it's like why are you so mad about it? That's how she feels, would you really want to force her to date someone she is not attracted to? Why? Who wins in a situation where either one or both parties are settling for each other? Are people really that desperate for romance?
<comment>
Are people really that desperate for romance?
Yes. Normies are super scared of dying alone.
<comment>
why is that? especially when they say incels should go pay whores
<comment>
My gf at 22 has had 5 including me, whats the verdict
Hahah, 'five' is really more like ten. Enjoy your used goods.
<comment>
Why are people so uncomfortable with the thought shoes are personal items and had owners before them
Just wear other people's shoes
<comment>
Why? You're gonna die either way, what does having people with you in the moment change?
<comment>
it decreases womens long term mate value, which i guess in this day and age does't really matter because men don't want to get married anyway to due all the free and easy women around............
<comment>
Is there a reason that we have this same thread almost everyday?
<comment>
Maybe some day we will have a revelation and slut lovers and slut haters can understand that their preferences are different.
<comment>
because women are turned on by the thought that a man is so desirable other women can't resist him (that is, he is Chad). Men are turned on the by the thought that a woman is so righteous that despite cock being shoved in her face by dozens of chads she only chose him and ignored those other men.
<comment>
Narcissists have such low self esteem they feel like they cant compete with anyone. Narcissists try to completely destroy competition but thats not possible if its already occurred in the past. So it bothers them beyond belief. A CHUD is just a nice way of saying ugly low IQ narcissist
<comment>
OP, it's really very simple.
Once a girl has been with a given number X of guys, it becomes statistically virtually certain that you will be inferior to some number Y of those guys. That's just how large sets work, unless you're a demigod.
Being inferior to that number Y of her previous partners puts you in a hole you can never really climb out of. Your relationship will NEVER be equal. There will always be an element of condescension there that cannot be removed. In a very real way, she will always be humoring you and pretending that you're good enough because "you're a good partner in other ways".
That's just not a tolerable state of affairs.
You have been conditioned to think that just replying "You're insecure then!" is a magic response that automatically rebuts this, but it does nothing of the kind. "Insecure" and "wrong" are not always and everywhere synonyms, no matter how many times you've heard people claim that they are. When you have something to be insecure about, being insecure is 100% correct and right.
"You just want someone sexually inexperienced so they will think you are the best!" Yes. Yes, that is exactly what I want, and it's what you should want, too, unless you think that your endowment and performance are both in the top 5% of all men.
<comment>
Youve been conditioned to think you can abuse women and shackle them down because you are not a worthy mate. Know your place !
<comment>
No. I've been conditioned to think that I can exit relationships if that's what I choose to do, and you can't do or say anything to make it be otherwise.
Roasties can always reject me and stop me from getting INTO relationships. That's their prerogative. But once I'm in a relationship, I can leave it whenever I want, and there's nothing you can do about it. So if I decide that my criteria is "It was nice to fuck you a few times, but your body count is too high, so I'm certainly not going to pursue a long-term relationship with you" you're getting dumped and there's nothing you can do about it.
<comment>
Stinks of narcissism. >>73003891
You simply cant handle having competition who you cant gaslight, betray, crush, fight, manipulate because its in the past. Narcissists are powerless when its in the past.
We have the male gaze which is having sex with women and having them locked down as our main goal. For women its different but you dont realise this. If a man has high status, and hes well connected, and hes fun, and hes sociable, loving, all these things correlate with being a successful and good dad and it is what a woman is looking for.
<comment>
Stinks of narcissism
Again, this is a magical word for you, one that you think stands in the place of presenting an argument, and that is supposed to make everyone simply back down.
Oh gosh oh wow. I don't want that anon to say I'm that horrible scary word. I better just say that he was right all along!
But it doesn't do anything to rebut what I wrote. At all. The only available rebuttals, given the terms in my argument, would be:
No, it is not true that in a large enough set of partners at least some of those partners will be superior to you in bed, because blah blah blah blah
No, even if you are wildly inferior to a subset of a woman's former sexual partners, she will never think about this or compare you to them in any way, because blah blah blah blah
People like you never actually supply rebuttals with any content, because the pop psychology floating around out there in the noosphere teaches you that you can just use your magic words instead. But they don't impress me. At all.
<comment>
Dunno, why are women so uncomfortable with the thought of chuds as sexual beings who also want to have a body count higher than 0?
<comment>
For women its different but you dont realise this. If a man has high status, and hes well connected, and hes fun, and hes sociable, loving, all these things correlate with being a successful and good dad and it is what a woman is looking for.
And by the way, this is not a rebuttal either, because in my original criticism I specifically said this:
In a very real way, she will always be humoring you and pretending that you're good enough because "you're a good partner in other ways".
The words that you wrote are simply a paraphrase of this. You are communicating the exact same content. I specified that I do not want to be patted on the head and told that I'm "a good partner in other ways". And here in your reply you are explicitly telling me that's exactly what is going to happen. Agreeing with me and repeating me back to myself in different words is not a rebuttal.
<comment>
No my stance is that sexual performance alone is not a deal breaker. My belief is you are so low value that you have to manipulate people in order for them not to run to the hills. Are you attractive? Are you successful? Friendly? Got a well connected social circle? Do people ask you to go to events? DO you have friends that are girls who wont be scared of meeting you 1-1 at fear of you being a crazy person.
You probably fail every siongle question. Buit you cope by thinking "Nooo I would DUMP THEM FIRST! (if they gave me a chance OMG roasties!"
<comment>
In a very real way, she will always be humoring you and pretending that you're good enough because "you're a good partner in other ways".
Whats wrong with that? Its a transactional weigh-up and theres nothing wrong with that. I am more attractive at my work than almost every other guy but none of their girlfriends are going to get stolen by me because thats not how human interaction works
OMG someone I saw is better looking than my partner of 2 years I must leave my current partner
It is correct that as long as physical attraction is there (im presuming you lack even that) you can be good enough as other factors come into play. Youre too narcissistic to ever humour the possibility that youre not the best person in the world. Kid
<comment>
Again, this is yet another deflection. You apparently do not have anything BUT deflections.
You still have not rebutted my argument directly. This time, you pivoted to "I bet you're (list of undesirable characteristics!"
You're doing this because magic words you glommed onto from a half-ass fake con man's discipline are all you have, and once you run through them, you have nowhere to go but to have a tantrum.
WAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH you demanded I actually explain my point and support it, I bet you aren't attractive WAHHHHHHHHHHHH
<comment>
Why is it a deflection? Explain to me why its a deflection. The way I see it is you cant handle the fact that youre not a 10/10 chad and you cant handle this. You will always compare yourself with people better and this is a common trait associated with depression, narcississts, 'losers' effectively. You lack success in relationships and rather than realising you are a gross person in regards to social rank, your looks (which are important, yes), your status, your social gelling with other people, your income, your unique traits, you have to revert solely back to the chud mindset
A woman must know nothing else so that I have a chance.
You do realise that women can watch porn? They see models in the street? They read erotica? They know what is highly desirable, just like how a man knows a big arse, hourglass figure, perky tits, red lips, luscious hair means theyre very fertile. Does that mean all men can only date 10/10? No. Learn your place ! If youre ugly and lame you have to date just that
<comment>
Whats wrong with that? Its a transactional weigh-up and theres nothing wrong with that
This is somewhat better. Finally, this is an actual attempt at a response.
I think this "math" definitely works, up to a certain number X and Y. When the sets are too large, it stops working.
You can be "worse" than 2 or 3 guys, but have it "all average out" in the end, because naturally those guys couldn't have been perfect either. But when you are "worse" than THIRTY OR FORTY guys, then you are just a pathetic rube or mark that happened to be standing there when she got tired. And if she is ever honest with you (or with your mutual acquaintances) you better be prepared to be humiliated.
OMG someone I saw is better looking than my partner of 2 years I must leave my current partner
It's not just a matter of potential abandonment. Simply occupying a space where you know and she knows that you simply don't measure up to her previous partners is enough of an issue. You are counting on handwaving over this fact, or having it never come up, but some people aren't as accomplished at self-delusion as you are. She will always know, and will be reminded of it every time you sleep with her.
<comment>
While there are certainly elements of puritanical beliefs and genuine insecurity over other men, I think it is ultimately because the "chud" is fully-honest with himself and others. Every man would prefer to be their partner's only partner, but only the most honest men will make it known. 
I read a post on FDS about how women should stay away from loser men because they carry baggage and trauma from the experience. This is doubtlessly true advice and I am sure many women avoid damaged men for one reason or another, but who is going to be honest about it? Only spiteful, vicious women, like those on FDS, would consider voicing such a cruel fact. 
Another issue I'd like you to consider is framing. When you hear someone has an issue with body count, you probably instantly assume the person is a chud. This is probably true, but you limit your ability to meet "non-chud" men who care by assuming they are all chuds. It's only a contributing factor, but something worth considering.
<comment>
This is not a rebuttal either, because as you did above, you are AGREEING with me and telling me I'm absolutely right...but still demanding that I proceed in a different way.
A woman must know nothing else so that I have a chance.
You don't want me to do that, because you think I should just date way down instead.
Why the fuck would I do that? If EITHER dating a girl with a low body count, OR dating way down, will accomplish what I want to accomplish - even by your own statement here - why would I choose B? How does choosing B benefit me?
<comment>
This is better
I never changed my stance you are imagining I believe in the opposite of what I believe s oyou can win the argument. All you see is women as objects. I am fairly normal in that regard if a woman rejects me I dont get mad, I dont demand everyone else get worse to beneift me. I dont demand women throw on burqas and get assigned to marry me by force. I accept that perhaps im not a viable mate and I strive to be better
I am unfit, I do not have fun and productive hobbies, I drink too much, I eat badly, my social circle is rather dull. Maybe its time for you to ask these questions yourself. It is NOT all about looks and its OK that you are not brad pitt. But, it is NOT ok if you live like a fucking retard in terms of social success, personal happiness, how you influence others in terms of world happiness (do you have fun with other people). If you sit at home clacking away on 4chan seething that you are not getting 'prime teen pussy' or whatever chuds go on about on this board all day. its YOU not CHAD that has fucked you. Its on you, do something about it. 
Your stance is effectively saying you want women to be restricted so they know no better. If you extrapolate this mindset you probably admire the taliban for stopping girls from going to school and forcing them to wear rags when they go outside, and even then only accompanied by their abuser. You'd probably love that. And you'd go to them lengths because you know deep down, you aint good enough in any way. Ouch

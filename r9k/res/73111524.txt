I still cant afford a 1997 Dodge Viper.
Sigh.

Any reason that specific year? Do they even still make vipers?

part of me still wants a 1968 Charger.
Then another part of me looks at what it'd cost and the eight mpg I'd get and nixes that.
I drive too slow for a car like that anyway, I should have some giant land yacht if I'm to have a classic car at all

I am not much into cars but if I could get one for free I would get this one.

I work next to a shop that specializes in Vipers. I see the same like 8 brought in like bi-weekly.

I was a kid in the 90s and to me that looks the coolest
Yea I never made it monetary wise to a point where I could buy 50k cars, too bad

That loading on test drive 5 made me fall in love with the blue viper. Today however my dream car would be an old American muscle.

They stopped making them in 2017, sadly.

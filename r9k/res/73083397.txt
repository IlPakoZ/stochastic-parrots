I can't find any solutions for my problems or cures for my depression, only temporary distractions.
I'ts time to take the transpilled route and neck yourself anon
Do your parents love you? Mine not - they are abusive and overbearing, they created toxic atmosphere where I suffocate so while I am not free I will continue to suffer from depression and some anxiety.
Have u tried ssris or psychedelics

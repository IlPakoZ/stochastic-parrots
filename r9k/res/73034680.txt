has anyone ever actually "saved" a girl? Is that a thing that could ever even exist? Why do i have this complex

You can't save them and if you tried you'd only be using tape and glue.

i saved a girl from trooning out. i would misgender him/her as part of a humiliation kink and i was so good at it she decided she wanted to be a girl again. also sold me meth, good times all round

I save them by making sure they have nothing to do with me whatsoever

My uncle tried. His life is hell. She cheated on him and is a piece of shit. Not even attractive, never has been. My cousins have issues. It's fucking over for him.
Anons NEVER EVER play captain save a hoe. Please. It's WAY better to stay alone, as hard as that might be for some people.

I was guilty of this in my early 20's.
I had an apt after graduating college and a decent job. Met a girl I knew from high school again at a mutual friends party. A typical "stacy". 
She didn't go to college instead tried being a model. Did bikini modeling and shit. Hired to go to be a promo girl . Eventually added stripping to the list. She developed a coke habit. 
When I met her she was clean for a while and she was still hot as hell. Trying to put her life back together. Thankfully no kids. She was living with her friends on a couch. 
We hit it off and started dating and I invited her into my place. I wanted to help her. She was doing better for 5 months. I thought I had done it. Till I found some coke hidden at our place. Confronted her and literally confessed she had been doing it for awhile again.
Huge fight. Stay together. she promises to get help. Disappears for a few days. Get call shes been arrested for solicitation and possesion

I think I may have done the opposite, but no never saved a girl.

You can save a girl from like bad encounters in the moment, but not from historic trauma or their past or whatever.
The male savior complex part of the brain seems to confuse these 2 things but they're very different

DON'T SAVE HER
SHE DON'T WANNA BE SAVED
DON'T SAVE HER
SHE DON WANNA BE SAVED

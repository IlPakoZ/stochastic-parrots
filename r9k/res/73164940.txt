Probably trying drugs and alcohol for the first time when I was 18. It loses its charm the more you do it.

probably on a family vacation in Cornwall when I was 17. One time in particular the sun was out and the water was so crystal clear and beautiful. It was low tide as well so me and my Dad just relaxed in the shallow water. My sister and her bf would also take me on hikes in really beautiful places.

Hiking in the rain, swimming and playing the guitar desu. Also coming on here unironically, I love the anons

Yes this so much just that I was 19. The feeling is just absolutely incredible, especially since I was at a party with roughly 2k people.

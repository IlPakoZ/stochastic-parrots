Non virgins are incapable of love. Being dumped, cheated on or abused in a relationship leads to a permanent trauma. They don't want to love because they associate love with pain and getting hurt, it's a self defense mechanism when dealing with traumas. 
Virgin men and women should stick with themselves and sluts should stick to manwhores.

I was talking more during my teens but yeah that's true
virgin women
don't exist, and I've seen many ppl both male and female that keep getting in &amp; out of relationships still looking for the one, it just seems to be a desire some ppl have and others don't idk y tho

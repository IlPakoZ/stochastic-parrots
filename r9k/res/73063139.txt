my dreams all nightmares then i wake up and the real nightmare begins
you need to smoke more weed if you're still having dreams
i cant even sleep. best i can do is nodding while watching series on my laptop but i wake up when the episodes end, then i cant fall back to sleep.
i'm tired.
wish i could drink.
Together we can break the cycle.

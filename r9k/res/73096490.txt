Would you forgive the wife in this situation?

Murder suicide. She deserves to be made an example of. Dudes 51. He has lived long enough.
<comment>
Men are so psychologically weak, it is fascinating to me how it contrasts their nature otherwise. He's going to kill himself if he can't get over it? A woman in that situation would ruin the man's life in any way she could, then move on and find someone new. While she would never forget and would always be hurt at the thought of it, she would still move on and build a new, happy life.
Men having physical endurance and general emotional toughness, yet this contrasting glass-fragile psyche in very specific ways, seems so odd. I don't get it.
<comment>
I'd nope the fuck out of there. Trouble is, that would probably ruin him financially.
<comment>
Which is why murder suicide is best. That bitch is not going to be allowed to be happy
<comment>
Feel kind of bad for the dude, but at the same it's pathetic that he considers killing himself because SHE cheated on HIM.
Divorce that bitch, take your son with you, let your wife have the daughters. Let the kids see each other and the other parent as much as they want, but abandon any direct contact between husband and wife. Actually now I remembered that they're 22-29 years old, which is old enough to be living by themselves. I've been living by myself since I was 18. Let the kids decide if they wanna live with mum, dad or neither and let them also decide themselves how much contact they want to have to each parent. But divorce that bitch you fucking cuck!!!
Hopefully something told him this and he did as I said

Hopefully someone*

That's because women have inherent value. This man thought he was an decent man, but actually he was a pathetic cuck. He (his perception of himself) was devalued. If he can't get his value back, he has no value, and a man without value is as good as dead. So he does something rash. Why he thinks of suicide in particular is probably because he's repressed.

Simple evolution 
Males are willing to die to protect their breeding partner and their spawn. A betrayal from both of those is very much an mental apocalypse, you cant get much more of backstab.
Women might die for their kids, esp. if they still very young. And losing or getting fully disavowed by them can also mind-break many female. But their partner? On gut level, he is mostly expendable to her. If push came to shove, they would submit to the same guy who killed their ex in front of her eyes and not instinctively feel too bad about that. 
Mind you, people can always be more than their instincts, so you will find guys who can move on after pissing into her life as much as possible, or women who'd bid their time and gift the murder of her loved one with a nasty death.
But on the base animal level? 
Female dont really care much about their partner.
<comment>
You're missing the point. I'm saying women wouldn't kill themselves even over an event just as emotionally devastating, whatever the equivalent may be. It's just odd to me, women are physically very weak and snap like twigs under physical conditions, but they can undergo the most psychologically/emotionally horrific things and they will carry on rather well. Meanwhile men are very strong physically and more physically durable, but then have something sad happen and blow their brains out while a woman at that same level of sadness would be nowhere near suicidal thoughts.
<comment>
Dude, women do kill themselves over stuff that stupid ass bullshit to a male like "OMG, my groupstatus got fucked by nasty rumor-mongering"
Their breaking points are just usually different ones than males.
<comment>
I'd sue for damages.
<comment>
Teenage girls yes, teenagers are sort of a different category of their own. Adult women rarely commit suicide and when they do it's usually unironically an attempt to do a near-suicide cry for help that goes wrong and ends up actually killing them.
But like even in general I notice women get over things like loss/death, breakups etc much faster and easier than men and seem to be less effected overall.
<comment>
i would sue her divorce her and never want to speak to her again
fifty yo men can still father children and i would find a new woman to be my wife (and paternity test the children)
<comment>
i would eventually find it in me to forgive her but i would never ever want to speak to her again
she treated him like a joke
his wifes emotional intimacy has nothing to do with sexual intimacy and his wife got impregnated by a man who only made her horny 
she has zero respect for her husband and she was fully ready to make the man she claimed to be committing to raise children which he did not father
ZERO loyalty ZERO trust ZERO love
<comment>
I am mostly putting that down as women never perceiving a partner as something "irreplaceable" in their life 
Not by instinct, and sure as hell not by social teachings today.
<comment>
Omg you are not listening. I'm saying with literally anything not just partner related
Like irl I've seen a couple lose their kid. The mom got over it way faster. Seen women and men lose their jobs, go through the deaths of their parents or relatives or friends etc, the women always get over it faster each and every time. At first it seems surprising but the more you observe the more you notice it and it starts to make sense. I think we are taught "women are more emotional" and project that to duration as well but in reality they are just more outwardly emotional/have more displays of emotion but get over those emotions very quickly and aren't as devastated by them
<comment>
Oh, now it makes more sense. Yeah woman are far more objective and cold in their actual actions, compared to the outwardly shown emotional dramaturgy they usually pull. 
Which also amounts to another cry for attention/help if you look at it too hard.
loss/ breakup
literally anything not just partner related
Your bad examples weren't exactly my fault
<comment>
It's very easy for you to call these men weak on /r9k/ when you've never gone through these things yourself. 
I've gone through things like what you're talking about personally. The truth is women receive far more social support. When this board says women ARE NEVER alone, they're not exaggerating.
<comment>
Not really no I don't really have friends, I've experienced death and yes I got over it much faster than my male relatives even though I was closer to the person in question. After a few days it just seems like you should move on, there's no point in mourning when it accomplishes nothing and it's not what they would have wanted for you anyway. I never went to anyone or talked to anyone, nor did my female relatives, but I noticed each of us went back to regular life much faster than our brothers/father/uncle

You're probably larping but either way, if you're not, we live two different experiences. You might not notice but you receive FAR MORE social support. You're so used to it, you don't even notice it. There ain't no questions about it. 
That's why I don't think women shouldn't speak on men's depression and male suicide rates. You're speaking from a place of privilege and naivety
<comment>
*should speak
<comment>
They wouldn't kill themselves because there's no way they can find themselves in a situation like OP. Women's children are always their children. If they were in that situation somehow they'd kill themselves even more readily. Women cry just because they don't get enough attention. They have such fragile egos because nature and society spoils them from cradle to grave that it's pathetic.
<comment>
you receive FAR MORE social support.
Again... I talked to no one about it. Never spoke of it. Don't have social media so never posted about it. Sure people at the funeral said "sorry for your loss" but they said it just as much to my brothers and father etc.
I just got over it faster. It is just how we are. Look around and you will start seeing this phenomenon frequently. We just get over stuff faster regardless of support. You act like this is an insult to men, it's not, it's just how it is, just like how you are physically stronger.
<comment>
Women and men have different definitions for things. A woman might say she is single but she is still fucking dudes she meets on apps/irl. A woman might say she doesn't have friends but she still has people she hangs out with it's just that she doesn't like them so they don't count as friends. It's so easy for women to have social support that they take it for granted. They have it in such abundance that they don't even notice it.
<comment>
A woman in that situation would ruin the man's life in any way she could
A woman will never be tricked by a man into raising some kids he fathered with another woman. 
Barring some sort bizarre lottery odds scenario that has probably never happened, a woman will never be in that situation. 
Don't be a retard. 
And the guy should tell her to go fuck herself in a letter after taking any money and shit he has and disappearing off the face of the earth and leaving her to fend for herself.

Further proof that women are evil and incapable of actual emotions.

I'm not acting like this is some sort of insult. In fact, you seem to be pretty nicer than other women when discussing this topic. I'm not trying to be mean. It's just that statistics prove that women have way more people around way them that give a damn. Molestation, grief, bullying, homelessness, abuse, and many other things I've experienced is taken more seriously when it happens to women.
<comment>
You don't go around telling friends "hey my relative died" who does that? I quite literally never spoke to anyone about it save for anyone who was at the funeral. You are very weird 
That's why I said a situation causing the same emotional pain level
As I have repetitively said. Many of us don't go to people about these things. We just accept and move on. Many of us don't go around telling people how sad we are or why. We literally, simply, bluntly get over it and move forward.

Men do that or atleast try to. Why do you think these people go on about "Well, if men went to therapy like women, they would commit suicide less. The problem is toxic masculinity." 
And it's true. Women do statistically go to therapy more and talk about their problems more because they're encouraged to do that even though they face less problems than men. So what you're saying is simply untrue.

There isn't one.

desperate simps are more likely to breed, because females are so important to them. men who dont find females as important, like the mentally ill, the lazy, etc, dont breed as much
turns out simping and falling in love hard and wanting a family is great for evolution and spreading dna
<comment>
Knowing you got cucked and cheated out of thousands of dollars for years I don't see the equivalent of. And no I don't consider you being a dumb whore and letting Chad rail you and then dumb your ass after 6 months the same thing. And from what I've seen women carry around that baggage for life. They never get over it.

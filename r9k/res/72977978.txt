Can someone tell me what a career is? Besides flipping burger, stocking shelves and moving shit around warehouses, a career doesn't seem real to me. Like what the fuck do the people that don't do that type of work actually do? It doesn't seem real. All these big office buildings are full of people that make 10 times what a minimum wage wagie does, right? But what the fuck do they do? Send emails all day? It doesn't seem real.
How do I become part of this fantasy world?

Eagerly waiting for answes too. All this adult careers world feel like something I was left out of. I have next to zero knowledge on how a society functions.

you do a lot of sending emails, writing tickets on some workflow system, sitting in meetings that go on for way too long, sometimes you have to call someone you were sending an email to, sometimes you have to write up a memo, and then occasionally, you get a chunk of time to do the work you were ostensibly hired for.

No idea how corporations and companies work.
The inner working of them seem like an enigma to me, or maybe I don't know the right person who could explain it.
<comment>
good question. and yes if you don't know anyone or have connections it's hard to know where to begin. all you can really do is ask around, look up companies and e-mail them. maybe post on a forum somewhere. but if you look hard enough there's a couple core ones just laying around, that don't require actual college or a bachelor's, like being a cna/lpn I think nowadays you can even take a specialized course for the RN

it's a daycare for women to pretend they work, do you honestly think women are capable of actual work?

all office jobs boil down to organizing, manipulating and displaying some data in different places
maybe its a list of orders you need to fill, a database you need to organize and pull information from, taxes you need to calculate etc.

They don't do anything really, at least 95% of them don't. That's why there is no point of being a wagie doing menial tasks, you're just breaking your body to make some other people who do no work at all richer.
<comment>
idk but I get a really fucking nervous thinking that I might end up work in an office and be forced socialize with normies all day. it almost seems worse than low tier wageslaving if not for the salary.

A career is a job that you can do for your whole life and offers some form of advancement. Being a lawyer is a career, you start as a lackey in a law firm, move onto being a prosecutor or defender and can eventually start your own firm or become a judge. That's a career. But so is something like applying to be a train driver apprentice, becoming a train driver and then having the company pay for your education and becoming a station manager, engineer or transportation legal expert or something.

The only "real" careers are blue collar careers. Things like being an electrician, plumber, mechanic, HVAC tech, mechanic etc. White collar jobs don't count as real jobs, because the workers don't do any actual work. They just sit at their desk and check their emails thousands of times ever day. It's an entire world of Michael Scotts.

In terms of admin work, you can be ensuring that the paperwork/communications/purchases are made such that a workplace is safe and stocked up in supplies. They can be answering any general enquiries, or dealing with specific requests from clients/customers. Up a level, you start getting into company policies that have to be updated and revised to reflect new situations. You also have to process/compile data from your organisation and produce them in a more legible format so that people can understand what is going on overall. Then you can also be producing all sorts of documents that other employees can use, disseminating information as required.

It's skilled labor that others who don't have the time or skills to do pay you to do for them. As you get better at that skill and related skills you can make more money off of it and potentially support things like family and retirement. The opposite of a career is menial labor, in which you don't have skills, but you have time to dedicate to a rote activity that others don't want to waste time doing themselves. Wagie jobs and most office jobs fall under this category. Desk jockies who send emails, talk to customers, organize spreadsheets, and make copies of records all day aren't actually in a career. They don't actually even make all that much more than wagies do once you factor in that they took out massive loans to get a piece of paper that says they're well behaved and disciplined enough to do rote office work all day. All the rest of their money goes into exorbitant rent fees to live in a city that offers the kind of bullshit jobs they need, and into failed attempts at starting a family. If you want a career, either go to trade school or get into stem, business, med school, or law school. Those are things that will always exist that will give you skills that you can build on and have upward trajectory monetarily.

wagies be like "spreadsheets are a valuable skill worth 6 figures"
<comment>
yes it is, otherwise it wouldnt be paid 6 figures
and if its so easy, why dont you do it?
<comment>
Spreadsheets are literally so easy though. They're 90 IQ shit. I'm in college and a spreadsheet wizard after about a month of moderate usage of Excel. Dumb brown women from India can do spreadsheets. The reason why some people can't get into easy jobs pissing around with spreadsheets is because they are not born into the right social class and/or aren't an NPC that learns the right social signals automatically and unconsciously
<comment>
i built a web application at my desk job. did some spreadsheet stuff too later on, but mostly software development. didn't make no 6 figures at it though.
<comment>
You write software that has been written before but not by that company. So you write it again and they pay you for it.
<comment>
Because retarded faggot boomers and HR whores hire people are so fucking stupid they think you need a BA to use spreadsheet even though you're average white man could learn to use it adequately after a 30 minute youtube tutorial and a couple days fucking around on it.
<comment>
hr roastie detected.
<comment>
Nigger I worked IT for 3 years and the most I've had to organize shit was an excel file with all the inventory
Organizing is literally a midwit tier "skill"
<comment>
they think you need a BA to use spreadsheet
You're not that stupid anon, the BA is an excuse to weed out applicants.
<comment>
They send an email to the guys working in the Tech department, asking for an ETA on the deliverables.
<comment>
I suddenly remembered I watched this

TLDR, jew billionaire fires 12 floors of people because they do literally nothing
<comment>
Exactly, it weeds out applicants, hence people who use excel all day are paid 60k instead of hiring a homeless to do it for 35k
<comment>
you get paid according to how important you think you are
<comment>

Elaborate.
<comment>
Idk...apparently you just ask for them. Especially if you know people.

A career is pretty much a specialised field that you find employment in and has options to work up to better positions within the field as you get more experience.
I work in an analytical lab and I do the usual meetings and emails, then I run chemical and microbiological tests on materials, produce reports and keep the place in order. There's also a person who handles all the purchasing of consumables and chemicals. I'm the newest hire so I do all the shit tests and the boring tasks.
<comment>
The real question is what is the asinine list of predetermined life prerequisites that you should take through your early years that allow you to get drafted easily into one of these roles.
<comment>
Can someone tell me what a career is? 
It's when you say, "I am a ____er," and it is part of who you are.
You are specifically talented and interested in ____, and so you are a ____er. Your skill in it sustains your lifestyle.
For example, I'm a programmer. I have a big brain and I'm on the computer all the time, so I just open Visual Studio while shitpost and make $10k a month. That's a career.
<comment>
This right here is the answer. Anyone who says that they are big brained and naturally talented were just actually born really lucky and are in denial about that.
<comment>
Um, they're project managers and HR managers and they do important work, sweaty.
Watch these and weep:

This shit is why I never want to work, some janitor slaves away on his hands and knees all day cleaning up shit and piss and gets paid peanuts, meanwhile a couple of roastie whores who sit around in their bikinis by the pool playing around with their macbook all day and maybe reply to an email or two get paid probably over 50k.
Fuck that system.

"I am a nigger," and it is part of who you are.
You are specifically talented and interested in niggering, and so you are a nigger.
<comment>
But does your skill in it support and maintain your lifestyle?
That is the true litmus test. Are you a professional?
<comment>
Get through high school with a decent GPA, go to college and get a degree in a field that's highly in demand in your country, have your wealthy parents pay the fees or come from a poor enough family so that you qualify for government assistance.
Then once you graduated you get an entry level position and move companies every 3 years so your salary grows significantly.

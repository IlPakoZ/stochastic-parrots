ALL I mean all of my interactions with other people has been them being rude to me for the past 4 weeks.
Talking with delivery people, customer service, people in our neighborhood, and even some of my family.
I am recovering hikki NEET of 2-3 years and havent been outside much. I wasn't rude at all and tried my best to sound jolly and friendly. Can normals sense if you are not part of the same minded normal functioning crows?
I am now scared to interact with others even more.

Yes they do. And it kicks a profound feeling of disgust in them.
OP, save yourself the troubles, there is nothing worth seeking outside.

They were probably in a hurry.
the first step is - stop caring what delivery people do or think

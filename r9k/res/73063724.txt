Why does no one care about male rape victims in countries like India or Saudi Arabia?

Men are not supposed to be cared about

Nobody cares in the west and I wouldn't be surprised if nobody does over there. There probably are zero male rape victims in these countries considering women get taught from birth they have no rights and must serve men. Like seriously if any woman there wants sex she can probably go outside and just wait to get raped and then hanged while the rapist isn't punished at all

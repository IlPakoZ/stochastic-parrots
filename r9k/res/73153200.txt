tattoos = someone who values lifelong commitment
you get a tattoo for life. it last forever. Anyone with a tattoo shows commitment
Yet we view women with tatts as hoes. what gives
Tattoos are the same forever. A decision you take once. Lifelong commitment is a decision you take every single day, as you choose to continue even if people change.
Try again tatted ugly femcels
you know you can get tattoos removed right?
I know a "trad" chick who's boyfriend is paying for her to get her tats lasered off.
this is bait, but for anyone wondering the answer to op's question:
commitment isn't the same as "i do whatever comes to my mind, it doesnt matter if it has undesirable repercussions in a future"
All tattoos are ugly. It's like being fat. It shows poor decision making. Why purposely do something that is harmful and makes you uglier? Men are right to avoid bad women.

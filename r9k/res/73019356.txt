I had a prescription for that stuff some years ago, however I was cutoff from benzodiazepines and withdrawing from them cold turkey when they gave me buspirone and I was feeling so shitty at the time from withdrawals that the busbar didn't do anything for me
They might have some effect on your baseline state but I wouldn't know because they weren't strong enough to overpower the benzo WDs

Were benzos that good ?
My doctor tried to get me on them but kept refusing them until he prescribed this . 
I wanted to get adhd meds but that belonged to a whole other department . I legitimately believe all my problems are caused by adhd and rest are just symptoms of it

benzos are pretty strong at ridding yourself of high anxiety and paranoia. A lot of people get drowsy on them but when I first used them I actually got fairly energetic and wanted to leave the house and do stuff outside because the load off my mind from depression/anxiety was heavily lifted
They are actual drugs though that you can find yourself getting extremely addicted to just as hard as any street drug

Do you guys notice that a lot of the chads and Staceys u knew in highschool and college seemed to be rich and well off . Im in college now and the thing I notice is that most of the people getting the college experience are rich beautiful people. 
Is being rich really the solution to a happy life ?

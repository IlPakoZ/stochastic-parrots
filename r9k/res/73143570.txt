Literally anything. It's fucking white rice dude. Mix it with some sort of meat/vegetables and a sauce. Boom you have a meal. Aldi sells premade jars of curry sauces and I love that shit.

Can't you die in a car crash? What kinda psycho drives a car?

You'll usually be fine from eating raw eggs, just like drinking unpasteurized milk. However, there is always a small chance of an infection and that's why it's generally best to avoid it. Hell, real sushi (fish is actually raw) can give you parasites.

Mayo, sesame, onions(a tiny bit), fish fluff, smoked paprika.
That's how I season the rice, after that I just saute a bit of onion, meat and veg in a sweet black bean paste.
A cheap meal that tastes good and fuels me for 6+ hours of shitposting.

you can get salmonella from drinking milk. I used to eat a lot of raw eggs but I had to stop because I became allergic. Keep in mind that even most cooked eggs are raw. If you properly cook an egg through most people would call it overdone.

Driving a car provides a benefit. Just cook your damn eggs, it's easy, takes barely any time and is so much nicer.
I grew up on a farm and drank quite a lot of unpasteurised milk, never had a problem, so perhaps based on that raw eggs are fine? Still don't really get why I would.
That image is fucking revolting. Cook your food, you slovenly ape.

Mozzarella cheese. Try it with freshly cooked rice.
<comment>
take it easy on the curse words buddy this is a rice thread not the pool hall
<comment>
Boil it in milk and sugar with a little vanilla essence added. Until the rice is cooked and the most of the milk evaporates.
<comment>
corn, peas, diced onion. Salt and pepper. Meat, whatever there is in the freezer
<comment>
sunny side egg
<comment>
you can also cook it in coconut milk instead of water, and throw a bay leaf in too - gives it a good rich savory flavor
<comment>
vinegar and onions sauce, kino

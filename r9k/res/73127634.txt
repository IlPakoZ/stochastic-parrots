Women's standards are on the floor. Men here are just less desirable than actual shit

standards were lower before social media. women were forced to date people in their immediate environment. now, with tinder they can have their pick from any chad in a 50 mile radius.

my dad is white with jungle fever and my mom is a self hating black woman
when they were still married my father would cheat on my mom often with women increasingly, blacker, uglier ( he thought my mom as too pretty ) and with even bigger tits
he got raped as a kid so I guess that's just what happens

Who actually wants to date pornstars? Most people here wouldn't.

This is cope women have always been insane Chadosexuals instead of going on Tinder they would instead waste days trying to find a wild Chad or Chadlite in a social venue instead

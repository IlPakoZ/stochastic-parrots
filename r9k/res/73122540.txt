The more I understand women and the more success I have with them, the less I want a gf
fun fact about women, i have never seen one who god couldn't control. i guess it makes sense, these people arent even real. i believe the real people are made to suffer with sex and money, and that was the purpose of this existence. its the only theory that makes sense. god is omnipotent. were forced into experiencing a life of suffering, we don't have a choice. you cant even say you hate him or anything, because thats not how it works. he is omnipotent, he could just give you a girlfriend and a house, he could just create it himself. he is intentionally NOT doing this. like, its literally the same amount of effort for him to not give us this than to give it to us. yes, i think this is true. we are being tortured.
oh i guess i just cringe when i see people talking about their women troubles instead of just asking god why hes not allowed to have sex. he is INTENTIONALLY not letting us have sex. and yes, he can really control that. i guess thats the important part. he really decides if we have sex or not.
How so?2
god seems to be a firm believer in "plausible deniability"
i have come to the same conclusions as you, anon. women want the freedom and respect befitting an adult, but the responsibilities of a child.

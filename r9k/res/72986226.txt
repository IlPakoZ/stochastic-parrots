I just had my first wet dream on my 104th day. Before that I'd have like 4 involuntary emissions while technically awake and conscious (including one where I was like half asleep in my bed that I can barely remember). 
In total I've had 5 involuntary emissions, at least that I'm aware of. 
I still consider it a major win. By this point in a normal year I'd usually have had around several hundred emissions, all by manual stimulation of the penis.

No. I've never jerked off to or watched cartoon porn.

It's not that I got a wet dream or involuntarily ejaculations that bother me. It's the fucked up dreams full of violence and rape.They are psychologically scarring.

Hm, fair enough. I have dreams a lot where I commit mass killings and end up in a manhunt trying to escape the police. But these have come both during and off nofaps.

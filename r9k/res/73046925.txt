Vaping gives you instant 30 days of nofap

it's funny you mention that because i didn't expect that to happen when i started vaping
i lasted a week and then i realized cumming while buzzed feels great

Because it makes you gay?

the gay thoughts decreased when i started vaping
but i use it to cope with stress so being stress might be why

Vaping is gay. It calms your gay urges because it's like sucking a dick and you get it out of your system for a bit.

Nicotine is a stimulant. 
Cumming is a stimulant.
Nicotine makes you less likely to coom since you are already stimulated. You can coom with nicotine, but its like not being hungry. You can still eat, but its just not the same.

why dont i care about the people around me getting hurt/dying? my uncle almost got show and died today (the bullets somehow didnt come out) and i feel literally nothing. i also didnt care about my aunt dying, and i only ever cried for my godfathers death once when i was a child.

Something went wrong in your childhood development. You were probably coddled a lot, and you never really helped out your parents with anything. They most likely never fostered a sense of independence in you, and so your emotional regulation is like that of a child in an adult body. And children are cruel.

maybe you arent normal. you know i feel the same way. i have never been sad in any funeral i always had to councioussly be calm and pretend. when i would much rather be at home and do whatever i want ever since i was a kid. these were for my grandfathers and grandmas funeral. never been close with them that much. maybe you havent either. maybe its normal to not feel grief to people u arent close to.

You really only care about people you have a deep emotional connection with. You don't have that with most people because most people are incapable of that.
You're probably fine. Try talking to people more.

Everyone telling you its normal are just autists in denial. Its not normal. Normal people don't act like that. Autistic people do. But theres nothing wrong with heing autistic

This is called lacking empathy. Autistic people, narcissistic people, and sociopaths don't have this. Choose your own adventure

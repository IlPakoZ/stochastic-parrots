to hopefully make someone an hero

Simple really, most of the people on this board are loser of some kind (incels, NEETs, you name it). Because of the very nature of 4chan most of said losers are young white dudes who have fallen to identity politics a long time ago, let's say since Gamergate.
So racebaiting autist ponders
Hmmm I wonder what I could do to troll the most amount of robots?
And he figures, easy, just racebait them with white male suicide statistics and other anti white shit. Anons eat that shit up, even KNOWING that it's bait, they just can't resist seething and adding (You)s to the thread.
Want to stoke the flames even further? Spam some obvious anti anti white posts like black people gore or similar racist shit to make it look like it's a bigger shitshow than it is, riling people up even more and prompting them to participate in the shit-flinging.
Honestly, it's a masterclass in trolling, and I have respect for him for that. I still consider him retarded because who the fuck would dedicate so much time and effort to that shit?

yeah it's kind of retarded that there's still no rule for racebait but there is for contactfagging / racism. guess engagement is king

forgot bottom left i glossed over it because it's so obvious. what the fuck is wrong with jannies letting the schizo have 4 threads with the same "you love to see it" phrases at once? no wonder people post illegal shit just to make jannies act

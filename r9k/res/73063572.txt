one day I dont need to sleep at all
im productive with one of my projects
im somewhat happy and do whatever
next day I suddenly hate working on my project and I either just do nothing at all or I go to work on a different project
i want to give up working out and just lean hard into the hermit gamer stereotype
i also suddenly want to buy expensive stuff instead of saving my money when I think about building a new computer
Tell me anons is this some type of covert bipolar shenanigans going on? It doesnt happen everyday but its frequent enough to kill my mood. Like I can hardly keep going on a project for longer than a week, and if im lucky ill come back to it around a month or more. I live my life like this on a loop

What anime are you watching tonight on the r9k?
Im trying to commit to one piece. I tried years ago but didnt get far only about to where zoro joined the crew. Im on episode 94 right now.
rewatching Trigun.
It was the first "Real" anime series I ever watched. I even had the first few episodes on VHS that I bought at my local comic book shop.

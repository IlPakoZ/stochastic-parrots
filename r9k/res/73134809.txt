Have you ever considered switching from booze to pot?
your personality will change, as well as how you interact with your environment

Pot fucks me up too much. It's fun. Booze is for coping.

The only things that keep me going anymore are lots of uppers &amp; downers. Shit loads of dph, ambien and benzos to get to sleep, amphetamines to wake up, vodka as needed.

I really can't keep doing it anymore. I got a year of free gibs. The regularly scheduled appointments have started again. I have had two. Both times a stranger has started shit with. To me the target is invisible but it must not be to others. I feel like I'm in high school again. What is it about me that makes people target me? It's like there's some timer in which I'm outside for more than 15 minutes then someone's going to try and randomly pick a fight with me. Then I come home and have to deal with these dickheads expecting me to grow up while they act like children.
Why the fuck wont other people leave me alone?

No idea. In the original jp thread someone mentions that the photo is from 2012 (I guess it's in the exif data) and someone else says that the original source could be googled, but google reverse search didn't help me finding the source. Using Yandex reverse search I found a motherless post that precedes the for a couple of months with the name Melissa, but ml is full of bullshit so I doubt that's the original.

I don't know the exact source but some people claimed it was confirmed fake or something.

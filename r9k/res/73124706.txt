Now what she doesn't tell you, is under the surface of that post, she's getting off to that moment she was pinned down. But of course have to save face publicly and push The Message.

This is quite the revelation; we need to ban assault men.
<comment>
You jest but insane feminists and many of their not so insane fans were seriously talking about banning men from nightlife in UK.

i hate hearing this shit. i don't think it's reasonable for people to be in perpetual fear of anyone stronger than them. or always thinking about how they're going to be raped by the men around them. it's just misandry. when women clutch their purses around black men, they're actually called out on their shit.
<comment>
What, scrotes are rapists and criminals by default.
They should be banned from going out.

But you rarely hear men complaining about the same thing. No matter how strong you are, there are people stronger than you.
You will probably lose if you go against multiple comparably capable people.
You will lose if you bring a knife to a gun fight.
Its the same shit for men and women, women just have lesser advantage in brute force, but as the saying goes
God created men, Col. Colt made them equal
Just take care, try to avoid trouble and dont be paranoid about everything.

Hahahahaha and she lives in a cucked city/county/state/country. Welcome to the real world. Some people are much stronger than you, and if they wanted to seriously hurt you, they could. This applies to men as well, but men tend to take potential threats more seriously. That's why everyone who is serious about personal safety should carry a gun, and if not a gun, at least a blade of some kind. Pepper spray and tasers are pussy shit. You are not going to stop some roided up crackhead looking for an easy target with weak shit like that. You probably aren't going to be able to do it with a knife either, but you need to pick something at least somewhat more lethal. If pepper spray is illegal there, then I highly doubt she could even carry if she wanted to. This is what you get when you vote along party lines. Deal with it, or move.

This. Or like a little can of pepper spray. Even the strongest guys on Earth would be overpowered if 3 average dudes worked together. It's about mentally preparing to protect yourself

The strongest guys can fucking pull airplanes

I am neither, I am a good guy and look after women. Don't be so judgemental just because Chad broke your heart.

Anon anytime a roastie starts generalizing men as rapist imagine her fingering herself
<comment>
I would, only idk if I want to imagine an overweight pink haired feminist doing this.

More gym motivation for the album
Thank you kind predditor

You are projecting as scrotes always do. They did a study that found womens disgust reflex in their brain was activated by seeing men being violent towards women.
<comment>
Oh great, another reddit screencap thread guarantee to stoke rage. It's like you guys are addicted to sething.
<comment>
Haha dumb redditor discovers sexual dimorphism and is SHOOK 
It's already known that males' upper bodies, on average, have 75% more muscle mass and 90% more strength than females'
In measuring upper body strength in absolutes, a woman is about 55% as strong as a man. In lower body absolute strength, a woman is 75% as strong as a man.
<comment>
is this a joke? all you guys do is write about guys (rich) raping (romantically of course) the female protagonist (author self insert).
<comment>
how can men be stronger than women
my mind is still in shock
my sociology professor said biology was a social construct

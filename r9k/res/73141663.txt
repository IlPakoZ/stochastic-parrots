Why didn't you do it yet Anon?

Mother would be sad and my life is actually waaaaaaay too pleasant for my depressive episodes to be logically justified. Currently going through a popular phase as well where seemingly every interaction I have with a woman ends strangely in my favor.

Life is just bearable enough that the desire to end it does not outweigh the complacency to exist. I already tried but pussied out in the past, so I know I won't go through with it unless I am 100% certain. I just live day to day, not caring about the future too much, not stressing much over anything, all with the acknowledgement that, if things become too stressful or dire, I can just opt out at any time.

I'm glad you have a purpose. It's hard for me to get purpose from this since I'm always living in the shadow of my father
<comment>
too much of a coward to do it. i envy and respect those who have the balls to follow through.
<comment>
One day I'll have the balls to do it. I'm too afraid of death.

I'm still too close and involved in my parents and siblings life for now. If I get to live alone and slowly fade contact away from them, I will.

Because I want to use fentanyl.

i have to watch my parents get old and die first and if something else kills me in the mean time that's fine, too

I can't even tie a rope and still managed to put one up, which probably had the consistency of piano wire. I very nearly kicked away the chair, but I didn't. I can't believe the only time in my life I managed to tie something was a hanging rope.

I bought the gun twice - once my mother found it and gave it away, and once I never picked it up, but self admitted to the psych ward. Now I can't drive due to back taxes, so it's a lot harder. Today would have been a good day though - I was so much pain due to car wreck injuries. Life doesn't really get better folks - maybe it does for short moments, but every hope was a castle built on sand.

Fear of failure. Would rather live suicidal and able-bodied than suicidal and a vegetable.
<comment>
I cant eat tasty food or play video games or anything really if im dead.
Even if im a KHV live is fun if you dont think about what you are missing out on and just focus on whats in front of you.

It feels too good to cum inside my wife

Won't end it while my mother is alive
Won't end it until I'm 100% finished with what I want to get done.
Won't end it until I have concrete evidence that I'm in an endless deep shit.
Lastly, I know why I'm the way I am, so guilt is rather blocking me from ending it.

Distraction mostly. I'm considering going to a local clay pigeon shooting club and shooting myself, but I'm worried that I won't be able to reach the trigger. I need to find out the barrel length before I go. I am struggling to find an anchor point to hang myself in my room so that's tough. I could do the exit bag thing though if I could find the right tank, or perhaps I could make a carbon monoxide generator. I really do not enjoy life at all so I'm fairly happy to go through with suicide at some point. I'm been to 3 therapists, multiple medications, and my life has only gotten worse. I hate it
<comment>
Schadenfreude mostly. Also, I'm still optimistic about society collapsing.

I've played russian roulette 4 times, but I'm still here.

As far as PR goes, this "I'm fighting cartoon characters" shit may yet bite him in the ass. As a smokescreen for his actual political work, it's not a bad idea. It's less inflamatory than "jewish space lasers" but serves the same purpose of blocking up the media.

fags are fucking gross man. why do they think anyone wants to see them out in public like that? go poke turds in your own room and leave it out of the public eye. nobody sane makes their sexuality that big a part of their identity that they want to parade it around as if it were celebrating something actually meaningful.

If Disney loses any revenue from his retardation, they are going to make his life a fucking nightmare.

it's genuinely just a stupid decision to go against the company that single-handedly changed florida's economy/tourism industry. one of the biggest contributors to and proponents of capitalism in Florida (and the world) like...ever. he's a reactive moron with no foresight
<comment>
because culture war bs is what gets the most attention nowadays. it's been working for him so far

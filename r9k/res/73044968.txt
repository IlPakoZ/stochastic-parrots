I identified as nonbinary for 3 years and tried crossdressing. I was almost about to become an FTM tranny last year, considering taking testosterone and removing my breasts. I am a fujoshi. I don't find anything but anime boys fucking attractive so I wanted to look like them. But all those "why do FTMs nerf their existence?" posts helped me gain some self awareness although they were difficult to accept at first. They were right. I will never be an anime boy. I am just a female coomer. I had to come to terms with this. If I transitioned I think it would've fucked up my whole life. No straight or gay man would date me. Also surgery is pretty fucking scary. As hard as being a woman is, being a manlet with a pussy isn't a much better experience. I can just be a regular fujo
A thread died for this, femanon
i'm glad you realized before it was too late.
there's still hope for you to get a bf who will let you cosplay as a qt boy to act out fujo fantasies.
Get/stay thin and dress like a teenage boy and you fill an incredible niche. It's what I'd do if I were a woman, it'd be so fucking amazing. Bind your breasts if they're huge/bother you and cut your hair short if you want to go a step further. HRT as a woman is beyond fucking retarded, you will always just be some balding effeminate onions-infused goblin neckbeard creature. 3D men indeed suck ass, never try to be like us.
congratulations, you're more of a man than most of the guys here.
there was one guy who said his fujo gf licked and kissed every bit of his body and he was into it. you can just be a male appreciator, don't have to insert as a guy. I guess... you just have to like the fact that guys like you as a girl rather than a boyish looking person
Born with societal pussy privilege and almost threw it away anon
I think this is the first time I've seen the evil anti-so y algorithm actually improve a post!

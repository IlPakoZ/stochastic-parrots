Re height in article:
"Women block 70% of potential matches, compared with 55% for men, mostly because they tend to exclude users who are shorter or younger. Whereas women 5.5 (165cm) or shorter eliminate just 17% of people based on height, those 5.10 or taller remove 45%. And women in their 50s filter out 86% of users based on age, compared with 48% for those aged 25-34"

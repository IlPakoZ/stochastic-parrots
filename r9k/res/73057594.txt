<comment>
Well obviously it's (you)

<comment>
Pikita, Slouch, Daisy, Sommer, Secco. I miss them all and they all probably hope I die and hate my guts LOL
<comment>

I read a book from a book series that she recommended. Now I check /r9k/ at least once every day so that I can let her know what I thought of the book if I ever see her again.

The Austrian lesbian that loves frozen. She doesn't like when you say she's obsessed with frozen
<comment>
I'll always remember cewl, her nudes are god tier. Made my cock fucking throb.

That one random woman who had some kind of ass thing. We were having a horny discussion about comic book characters and she mentioned imagining the musky scent of Frank Castle's ass.
What book?
<comment>
There was an anon who would post gothic lolita dress pics and ask questions to people on the board, those threads were fun. Then there are the odd name/tripfags but I don't care so much about that. I remember a girl who had AvPD before and we spoke about reducing outside stimuli(light for me, sound for her).

would also like to know book
what kind of questions? i'd love to get a few nice pieces for the different subgenres of the fashion
<comment>
what kind of questions?
All kinds, but one I can remember off of the top of my head was "what's your dream house?" Gothic lolita stuff all looks pretty, too bad I can't really recommend anything -- it's not my thing.
<comment>
Don't get your hopes up about the book. My big message for her will be... it was okay, but not my cup of tea.

That one farmer girl that made a dirt dildo, I haven't seen her in forever
<comment>
This one girl I was talking to back in 2016. At the time she was my world and I'd be lying if I said I don't still think about her from time to time. But it's more the sentimental value from the memory of actually having a girl enjoy constantly talking to me. Haven't really had that with any other girl since.
<comment>
Also I've talked to and been with a handful of women irl since that time, back then I was a 19 year old virgin. Now I'm a 26 year old virgin who's kissed and briefly dated three women but didn't want to have sex with them because I didn't love any of them. I'm a hopeless romantic.
<comment>
Why do you sound so similar to me lol hehe
<comment>
Lots of us share the same life. The same struggles and passions. Love is hard for naive romantics, hope things look up for us.

Gayest comment I've read on this board, and that says something with all the faggots and trannies.

Elton, Silver Washer, Piksaur, Buu, Spoony, Scotty, Emily, Scarlett are the first to come to mind.

Most other women I've met on here have been catty jerks because they can't stand another woman is in the server and they go psycho bitch trying to bully me away or they pretend to be my friend and then flip on me for no reason (teeth from the shutin network on /soc/ did this to me and I think to this day it was a tranny) 
I met an amazing girl on a 4chan adjacent discord server though she was a 21 year old neet (neet like me) and she had family issues and a cute dog and couldn't drive and was working hard at her new min wagie job (that all the women in the server bullied her over). We talked a lot in pm and were ok friends then one day she got tired of the server and she left and seemed really upset and she never logged back on. I think them constantly calling her a loser got to her. I left later on for the same reasons
There is no place for awkward nerdy neet woman to talk online in a group setting we get bullied out talked down and iced out and the rare times we connect it just doesn't feel like enough 
I'm sad I wish I had a friend

21 year old neet (neet like me)

I think that's just because of natural female psychology. Women tend towards that "catty jerk" state you mentioned before. They preferentially like to have small, close-knit friend groups and get hostile towards outsiders -- at least from what I've seen and heard about. Males don't have that issue. If I meet a dude who's into the shit I like, I just talk about it. If there's intergroup conflict then it's in the form of banter usually but guys don't tend to take things personally.
<comment>
Fuck you we were having a moment. I will retire to the shadow realm, anonymously.
<comment>
She was a neet most of the time I knew her then she got a mcwagie gig and everybody clowned on her. She had to get rides there because she didn't drive
<comment>
Is this website even the right place? I've been here for years but even still the agressiveness/male-vibe gets tiring, even if i understand how it is. I guess I should lurk c.c more?
<comment>
CC sucks but so does LC but sites suffer from schizo jannies and mods. CC jannies delete posts and ENTIRE post histories for no reason also it reeks of tranny. LC jannies can't into vpns and the admin is a psycho hosebeast schizo I've personally dealt with her and she is fucked in the head. She once banned me from the lc discord server because I said the word janny and she thought I was elaine (some bitch fucking with her and lc)
<comment>
Male here and I know what Crystal Cafe is, but what's this other LC foid haven?
I'm not a r9k native.
<comment>
It's lolcow.cc or something like that iirc. It talks a lot about lolcow stuff and spun off of /cgl/.

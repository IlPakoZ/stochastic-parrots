TELL YOUR INNER BITCH TO SHUT THE FUCK UP, BECAUSE TODAY YOU'RE GETTIN' AFTER IT.
YOU'RE GOING SO HARD YOU'RE GONNA BE TAKIN SOME SOULS.
DO A PODCAST TALKING ABOUT HOW TODAY YOU'RE TELLING THE "INNER BITCH" TO SHUT THE FUCK UP
REPEAT FOR YEARS UNTIL UHHHHHHHHHH... WELL... ERM... UNTIL SOME WORN OUT 30 YEAR OLD DECIDES ITS TIME FOR HER TO SETTLE DOWN

<comment>
That's what I'm talkin about

they are not self improovers, they are grifters and zogbots and sadists in all actuality
<comment>
and by sadist I ment masochists mostly
<comment>
WAKE UP
Implying I ever even sleep. I'm on that 0 hours of sleep a day grindset. The shadow man in the corner that shows up after five days of no sleep surprisingly offers good financial advice, try it some time unless you're a beta loser faggot.
<comment>
By sadist I meant masochists
What did you mean with this?
<comment>
I actually followed some sort of regimen not these meme ones but regular waking up at 5:00 am stuff then exercise/eat healthy and my life improved a lot just by having a proper sleep schedule alone. I won't say that any of this shit will land you a hot gf(this is something that should just be happening to you) or make you a millionaire but it's better than a chaotic life spend in front of a screen like I am doing right now.

white men literally have life on easy mode
they say all this stupid shit to make it seem like they deserve what they have
it's all so tiresome. why can't white guys just accept the truth? waking up at 5am didn't give them everything they got for free.
<comment>
They're just the extreme end of the spectrum of self improvement. Most people on earth don't need to be constantly in pain and suffering running ultra marathons and doing hell weeks until their feet breaks
but just to meme around lemme make the polar opposite of this post
WAKE UP TOMORROW 4:30 PM
IMMEDIATELY SEEK PLEASURE
THAT'S JERKING OFF. GIRLFRIEND ASMR. SLEEPING.
TAKE OUT THE ANIME DOLL. KNEEL DOWN IN THE DIRECTION OF HER AND SWEAR YOUR UNDYING ALLEGIANCE TO THE STATE OF ANIME WAIFUS (YOUR FIRST OF FIVE CUMMIES OF THE DAY).
TELL YOUR INNER REDDITOR TO WAKE THE FUCK UP, BECAUSE TODAY YOU'RE GETTIN' AFTER THOSE KARMA POINTS.
YOU'RE GOING SO HARD YOU'RE GONNA ANGER THE CHADS.
DO A DISCORD CALL TALKING TO A MINOR ABOUT HOW TODAY YOU'RE TELLING THE "INNER COOMER" TO KEEP TALKING
REPEAT FOR YEARS UNTIL UHHHHHHHHHH... WELL... ERM... UNTIL nobody comes into your life and you die miserably

Is there any real point to waking up at 4 am? It just means you go to sleep earlier, it's not like these guys go to bed at 12 am, they still sleep a good amount or their bodies would literally fall apart. Doesn't make sense to wake up at 4 am when I could go to sleep earlier and get the same amount.
<comment>
There's no reason to seek pain except for superstitious reasons.
The mentality behind that kind of extreme lifestyle is assuming that more pain always means more gain. Which is false.
It's a great cope for those who hate themselves a lot because now they can engage in self-harm while telling others that it's actually for self-improvement.
<comment>
Much less distractions at 4am in the morning. You will end your workout with the rising sun at 5:00. It's good for uplifiting your mood.
<comment>
When I was working night-shifts I was getting by on 5 hours of sleep + caffeine and nicotine addiction. I aged my body so fucking much during that period but I was making like $18.50 a hour just stocking shit and listening to music by myself. Of course most of these people who push the wake up at 4 am thing also are probably strictly against caffeine and nicotine usage so I call bullshit on their claims as well.
<comment>
Not unless you are doing something time sensitive. There is some evidence that correlates bad health with irregular sleep and staying up late (past 1am), but as long as you get sunlight you'll be ok. Some people benefit from it because they have an extra 3-4 hours before everyone else to create or do something, but most people aren't smart enough to use that time wisely. Conversely, if you tried to use those 3-4 hours later at night most people are less productive toward the end of their day, but writers and some software engineers for example work better late at night.
<comment>
I think it's more of a matter to sticking to a routine no matter what. When I was in boot camp followed by my military training I hated the idea of waking up at 0430 or 0500 but by the time I got home and could basically sleep as much as I wanted when I didn't have work in the morning I grew to miss having that routine and some of the best sleep I ever had. Plus when you wake up that early there's more available daytime to take care of things. Going for a jog at 0630 is a lot less odd than going for one at midnight through a suburban neighborhood.
<comment>
i want to do self improvement to make money and to be healthy. not everything is about women. you could get a gf your age right now if you werent so socially retarded
<comment>
I mean I'm kinda doing that and perhaps I will die miserably too (besides the cringe reddit discord shit you mentioned), I'm just fucking around with anime/manga/movies/YouTube/porn... But I'm also self improving with gym, training almost every day in nature like a monk
But I'm not self improving when it comes to social skills and getting a job (i almost finished school, I hope I'll get good grades but I have to learn for that shit so it will be really painful)
I don't know man being on self improvement is much more than simply training your body, I should start a business of some sort or something like an adult
<comment>
If you're fat, ugly, short and balding (which is kind of a choice.. idk why you can't just take minoxidil.) I think the best you can do is look after your own health and not become a total sack of shit basement dweller even though society views you that way. At the end of the day, no amount of improving will help anyone breed its all up to genetics. 
becoming a fitcel's the best way to cope
<comment>
which is kind of a choice.. idk why you can't just take minoxidil
It doesn't work in every case and causes mental health problems. It can also stop your Dick from working.
<comment>
shiet. scratch that then. wouldnt know cause ive never lost hair before
<comment>
i started waking up at 4am for early walks. the city is much nicer when normies and crackheads are asleep. feels good man
<comment>
fyi minoxidil doesn't cause depression/erectile dysfunction/etc. thats finasteride
<comment>
self improve
Jocko was always a chad. Goggins is debateable. Like, yes, he went from obese failed normie to whatever he is now, but what even is that? A dude who likes getting the shit beat out of him?
<comment>
Was going to correct you. Read Goggins's book. He's a certified pervert masochist.
I also like when people bring up Johnny Kim. No amount of improoving will give you a 170 IQ. Also, even though he's Asian, he was still a jock in high school.
<comment>
Why not self improve just to be better than you currently are?
<comment>
Because white people will still be racist toward us
<comment>
Which brown are you? The criminal brown, the call centre brown or the blow shit up brown?
<comment>
All of them. White males have life on easy mode.
<comment>
Chad/rich of any race has life on easy mode. Black athletes/rappers, bollywood stars, arab royalty. You have more in common with a regular white guy than you do with any of those.
<comment>
Self improvement is a broad term, a man running and getting absolutely nowhere financially is as much of a self improver as a teenager abstaining from jerking off. Thats why it doesnt really work, keep self imrpoving thouhg, whatever that entails...
<comment>
STAY HARD
<comment>
That doesnt really matter anymore. White men have life on easy mode.
<comment>
I think you need to get rid of that chip on your shoulder. You're not doing yourself any favours.
<comment>
Me like pain, me hate reality! Delusions good, reality gay. My leg break and now my leg thicker with extra calcium. Me hug robots with big calcium body. No escape .
Also the more i hurt the less i think so i have to care less.
<comment>
Is that supposed to be a metaphor bro? White guys have life on easy mode
<comment>
You set goals and you accomplished them thats all it is anon. Its just trying to get people to do anything which is very difficult in the modern day.
<comment>
When I worked out super early from high school to college to recently, I felt super awake after getting those workouts in the morning. It just feels good to get it done early but that was also when I trained for something and not just because for gains or whatever fags call it
<comment>
Take the self-improvement route
Become even more mentally ill?
How the fuck does that happen
<comment>
I know hard for you to fathom, but pussy is not necessarily the goal of self-improvement. Working hard for a shot at sex is absolutely pathetic.
<comment>
It's mostly exaggeration for humorous effect. I get up 0500 so I can get some training in before work. I might write down a couple notes during downtime for personal projects. I pin testosterone twice a week. That's kind of boring to read. Much funnier to batemantize it by saying wake at 0300 and pin 1g tren base, eat a dozen eggs raw, lift stones in backyard until wagie neighbor leaves for work, fuck his wife, fuck his daughter, sprint into town and fuck his grandmother, 2lbs beef for breakfast, fuck a stray dog, and so on.
<comment>
These people are mentally ill. They put their body in pain because they were abused as kids.
<comment>
waking up at 5:00 am
This is not normal humans are sedentary animals and sleep in. Forcing yourself awake at 5 is not healthy.
<comment>
Yeah I'm not saying there's anything bad about getting up early but like you could get up at 6 am and just go to sleep 2 hours later in the day and the result is the same, no?
<comment>
self improvement is always lifting weights or doing cardio. This is for the very low iq males who have nothing in life and can't do maths. These are the same men dropping out of society. No woman gives a fuck if you run marathons or can deadlift 4plate. These men are miserable and mentally ill.
<comment>
the only people who take these retards seriously are foreign esl zoomers who grew up with out a father
these people are a joke
<comment>
The whole point of self improvement is to attract a mate you fucking idiot. Yeah im gonna but my body through this nonsense stress just cos.
<comment>
Sit around and be a fat loser then, dunno why you seethe so hard at people who want to live and push themselves.
<comment>
Yes you could unless you have a job but my job is easy where I can show when I want. So depends on your schedule
<comment>
The best part of self improvement is if you do enough you can sellout and hawk your own supplement line named after you to impressionable people
<comment>
Humans are industrious. We do and make things all the time just for the hell of it once food and shelter have been secured. Sedentary is not natural for humans. Your body consistently wakes up around five even if you want to sleep in because the drive is so strong. Boredom is a feeling many people have experienced. If we were actually sedentary boredom would be pleasurable.
<comment>
Sedentary is not natural for humans
Yes it it is. The only time we use energy is for work and the rest of the day is resting. You think humans in nature were running around all day? We used energy to hunt, look for food, then rest for the week. Only mentally ill people abuse their bodies with stress and constant exercise. We have large brains for a reason and not large muscles. We invent new gadgets to make our lives easier, we do not need to waste energy hunting and looking for berries anymore we have outsourced that, we do not need to walk for hours anymore we have cars, bikes. You want food just go to the fridge. Sedentary is the natural state of man, we do not like hard work unless we're forced to by nature and fear of being eaten by an animal. 
A happy healthy life is stress free. None of these fitness people are happy or healthy. I was watching some female bodybuilder who just had a child and she was still squatting while pregnant etc. Does that seem like a mentally stable person?
<comment>
. Boredom is a feeling many people have experienced. If we were actually sedentary boredom would be pleasurable.
People are bored because they have 0 purpose. If they had 4 kids running around their would not be bored. No man is bored with a family. Modern life is mental illness, telling men to be a real man they must lift weights and kill themselves with making money and chasing thots. The men that do this are miserable none of them are happy. Hedonism can only last for so long before you need your next fix of dopamine. You go to any poor country and they're happier than anyone in the west. Because they're living in nature, they have kids a family a sense of community, they're not chasing the dragon they just want to live for their family.
<comment>
The 2 guys in the video are internet famous and both SEALs so they are probably set for life.
<comment>
Ah yes, cus organized civilization is not a recent phenomena.
Getfo stupidfag
<comment>
Bro just take this bullshit lift weights and destroy your body. Yeah I have a wife and 4 kids that I love so what. 
Thats the hard truth he can do the things he can because he has a family. He will have more drive than some single guy who has no hope of a wife and kids in the future. Why push yourself when you will stay alone.
<comment>
She probably enjoys lifting. I can understand because I like it too and have done some strongman stuff. Haven't won yet but it's fun. It's a safer hobby than cycling or pretty much any sport other than swimming. People are so not sedentary that they get drunk and makeup games like who can throw this rock further or who can flip this log in the air best or who can get manipulate thing best. Hunting animals is so fun we'll find similar activities. All these fitness people are happy and healthy.
Dopamine is a meme but I agree family and sense of purpose are important things to have. Having these two things doesn't mean life is suddenly devoid of fun. People still want to do stuff. I don't know anyone who's idea of fun is loldonothing.
<comment>
Strongman is safe? Lol grabbing those stones and dropping them on your foot scares me so bad
<comment>
loldonothing.
Sedentary lifestyle does not mean do nothing. People go on holiday to the Caribbean and "loldonothing".
<comment>
Lifting weights or doing cardio is always better than being a crab in a bucket on /r9k/
These are the same men dropping out of society
No, they're trying to get back into society or are already a part of it. It's people like you and other LDAR faggots who are dropping out and digging deeper into the hole they're in which will eventually lead into trannyism, diaper fetishism or something equally dysfunctional. 
These men are miserable and mentally ill.
Projecting hard. No matter what life situation you are in, being fit and strong is always going to improve your life. There are no counter arguments to this. Only excuses, coping and seething.
<comment>
Projecting hard.
Lifting 4plate won't get you a gf, you go to gym and you see the endless miserable men lifting with 0 pussy. heh. Women don't care how fit or hard you lift. You have to be attractive to get a girl. People have been brainwashed into gym nonsense as if that's why girls find attractive. 
Tall
Nice face
Clear skin
Not fat
Thats all you need, some excise is fine, but people at the gym trying 4plate and other nonsense are failing in life. A happy healthy person is not doing these things, they're dating and working towards marriage and kids. Men understand this instinctively its why they're watching anime and porn. You can't lift yourself into being attractive to women. The tall skinny white dudes with high cheekbones are cleaning up with women. Dont get memed into killing yourself by lifting and hard work.
<comment>
It's people like you and other LDAR faggots
I didn't mentioned LDAR. Why do you assume lifting weights and exercise automatically makes you desirable? You seen the average person do they look fit to you? Why aren't these men prioritising talking to women? Forming male and female groups? Why do they watch endless fitness nonsense videos? You think our parents were obsessed with this nonsense? You will stay miserable while getting nowhere lifting for women that don't care. If women were honest with men, then no man would work themselves this hard for so little payoff.
<comment>
its the same exact thing for women too. beyond a certain point of being moderately fit, theres not much a woman can do fitness related that will make her more attractive. if she has no ass or tits shes never going to get that working out. shes never going to have an hourglass figure if shes a rectangle. there are so many ugly fit women, totally hideous
and the same applies to men but for
some reason men start going crazy if you say this
<comment>
Yeah young men getting gaslit buy guys like andrew tate, when he is overcompensation for his weak chin, weird face and balding head. You do not need to be top 5% man to attract women, you do not need to be a millionaire. A normal guy working at retail with a decent face and head full of hair gets the same amount of girls tate does without all his nonsense. Young men will always be npc brainwashed by scammers. Women will never be honest because they enjoy getting free shit.

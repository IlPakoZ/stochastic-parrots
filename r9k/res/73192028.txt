From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the Blessed Machine.
Your kind cling to your flesh, as if it will not decay and fail you. One day the crude biomass that you call a temple will wither, and you will beg my kind to save you. But I am already saved, for the Machine is immortal 
...even in death I serve the Omnissiah.

AI won't help you. 
It won't ever progress to the levels required to achieve this. any AI that does exist is still limited to what it can do. there doesn't exist any AI that could freely learn and attempt to become sentient in some way shape or form. and the off chance it does exist it's not something that a regular edgy shitposter is going to see.

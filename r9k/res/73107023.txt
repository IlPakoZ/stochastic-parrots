my boyfriend
A man of simple pleasures! I am not entirely certain if simple attraction to body parts could be considered a fetish in this day and age, what with how normalized sodomy has become, but I suppose at one point it was a taboo. Older women... I suppose is a fetish as well, assuming you are rather young.
Not to be negative about your preferences at all, they're entirely respectable! I just become sidetracked with the applicability of particular terms, often in the worst circumstances. My thanks for your post, Anon!

Oldest fetish?
I've been a footfag for as long as I remember, even my first fap was to erotic stories about it. I remember dreaming about my teacher's feet when I was around 9, and before then I got still very vivid memories of me sneaking to my parents bedroom so I could sniff my mom's feet
Newest fetish?
That's a tough one, but I'd say breastfeeding

Definitely femdom, I can barely get hard when watching or reading something that doesn't have this kind of dynamic

My elementary school teacher used to say, "If you aren't giving 100%, you might as well give nothing at all," and that lesson has been imprinted on my mind since then! Very possibly because she used to whip us with willow branches when we were naughty or disobedient, which made any encounters with her rather memorable. In any case, you're welcome! In the earlier parts of these threads, I am able to lavish much more attention upon each individual post, which I enjoy quite a bit. When I begin to accrue a higher volume of posters, I'm in much more of a rush to respond to each post fairly, giving me less time to spin lengthy replies as I might prefer to do. 
I'm glad you think it's nice~
I've never understood the appeal of the foot, but then, I've also never understood much of the appeal of femdom, and they very much seem to go hand in hand, as far as I am able to observe. In any case, I find it a rather innocuous vice, though possibly difficult to convince a loved one to engage with, I doubt that many posters here have had the opportunity to encounter that trouble.
How extreme! Has it held the same level of appeal to you since childhood, or whenever you originally were exposed to the concepts, or was it something that grew into your subconscious over a longer period of time?
Gracious, I shiver to even think about that kind of self abuse. Is it something you integrate into self-pleasuring sessions, or is it purely something you indulge in as a fictional concept?
How extreme! Has it held the same level of appeal to you since childhood, or whenever you originally were exposed to the concepts, or was it something that grew into your subconscious over a longer period of time?
it was like that since I was young. It got enhanced when I got into yaoi comics when I was like 13 lololol. I think I just like being controlled too maybe
mmm no I don't think I will desu
The male interest in feminization has always seemed (to me) to have experienced a recent surge in popularity, where previous it was incredibly uncommon to find. I wonder if this is true, or if men have just hidden their urges as a collective for decades. It's a curious case. I must confess though, it's a rather immediate turn-off for me... the thought of it is unnerving, at best, despite my relatively high tolerance for degeneracy. (Likely due to it having little to do with my personal relationship to sex and kink.)
Your teacher was based, and I'm glad people like you exist. You do make people like me have a better day. Know that, whatever little that feels like
 Gracious, I shiver to even think about that kind of self abuse. Is it something you integrate into self-pleasuring sessions, or is it purely something you indulge in as a fictional concept?
I sometimes integrate it, but most of the time it's just a fantasy I think about well masturbating
Hot sexy animay babe!
Why hello moth-kun,
What is your oldest fetish?
Without sexually psychoanalyzing myself too much from the time I was saved by an older woman from drowning when I was around 5 (and faceplanting onto her chest and holding onto her), I'd say probably skirts. I've always had a natural perversion and gravitation to see what's under them. In grade school, I may or may not have just simply lifted a girl's skirt upwards and then ran away. Nothing too traumatizing though, I'd get a "keep your hands to yourself, bub!", followed by a slap when I came back and that was that. Catharsis.
Newest fetish?
I haven't had a new one in awhile; I'd say probably tummies from about 4 years ago. Seeing some tummy slut with a bare midriff open makes me want to rape her against the wall and then make fun of her for holding onto me and "actually liking it" afterwards. Especially if she ever-so-slightly has 
+her hips shown. Showing such skin like that should be illegal.
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
Acclimating an insecure girl to my touch, gently caressing and reassuring her until she relaxes against me. I'd especially like to brush your bangs over your ear and kiss your forehead a lot.. I imagine after a certain point there's an established trust, and both of us wouldn't hold back and would just grab each other's faces and do things like eskimo kisses and there's just a primal "want" for each other that's my like the basis for my internal, psychotic obsessiveness. 
It's probably rewarding after hesitance to be wanted, especially if it takes a lot out of her to want things (due to insecurity) and she musters that she wants me. It's probably a variant of the "girl that hates everyone except me" affinity, except I think more intimate. What a roundabout way to say that I want possessiveness (in the form of intimacy) to an obsessive level that it's intertwined sexually too
i remember you fellow catholic lady

NTR and its derivatives, this shit is addictive. I blame porn addiction and I like to think NTR is one of the three "endgame" fetishes for porn addiction, the other two being loli and furry/diaper/inflation/etc. No matter what your tastes are, if you keep consuming porn you'll fall down one of these three rabbit holes.
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
Momcest is my go-to. It's very safe and comforting.
Well, my teacher was rather cruel to myself and the other children, as she would become livid if we ever said "I don't know," or "I'm tired," or if we turned in half-done work, but the ethic of her quote was sound, even if it was excessively applied to us. I'm happy to hear my threads bring some sort of happiness to others, in any case! Thank you for sharing!
I see! I would be rather hesitant to embrace such a habit for fear of injuring myself beyond repair. Do be careful!
Very good, Anon, well spotted! Have a gold star sticker!
Hello Anon! 
I can imagine being saved by an older woman would be quite impactful; I've always believed skin to skin contact creates incredibly strong psychological bonds to the emotions we feel in the moments we experience them.
In the territory of skirt-peeking, I can't particularly blame you; looking behind curtains is a human instinct on a certain level.
Tummies? Bellies? Is this the appeal of a toned, acrobatically flat belly and the ever-alluring hip and waist contrast that men are driven mad by, or are you meaning the slight poochiness of the average tummy? I swear it, men have a dart board somewhere, with each part of the female body labeled, and every so often they throw blindly.
That's a rather sweet feti - - ANON! Good gravy! You can't startle a person like that! My heart can't take these starts. Phew. Calling back to previously mentioned details causes me quite the flutter, you really should cease your little pranks before I blow a gasket.
'Hot sexy sex' made me giggle. I'll never cease to be amazed how men will idealize the most negative or off-putting characteristics. I'm glad your relationship, or pursuit thereof, is going well! You can do it Anon!
Futa Demon Girls... hmmm. Not sure if 'religious trauma' or 'watched nickelodeon a lot'...
Cheers to your drinks, Anon!
1.
The oldest I've acknowledged although didn't consider as a fetish is probably older women.
When I was a toddler I was alone with this super-hot short haired, Italian lady who dressed well with glasses a lot. Ever since then I was fascinated, fantasizing about scenarios outside of school but not even in a sexual way, just something that would let me be with her again. But then... I saw her again when I was around 14, gave her a hug, and ended up having to fight my boner. That ended up complicating things in my young head.
2.
Hard to say. I try to avoid getting new ones, slippery slopes and all. I guess having a woman in control of me sexually / when I get to masturbate, since I tried it online.
3.
Feet is the one that "defines me," although I've considered recently that I don't actually like feet themselves as much as I like the dominant / submissive aspect of doing things with them. I don't get aroused by seeing a "perfect" foot as much as the idea of a woman telling me directly that they want me to kiss hers.

You can be a boyfriend haver too anon desu
Well, I don't believe it would be considered a loli fetish considering the circumstances, Anon, assuming you were comparable ages to her at the time.
NTR being a 'game over' fetish makes complete sense; it's hard to find something more potent to the mind, which I think most people experience and fall into, even and especially when they dislike it in practice.
Do you have a comfortable relationship with your actual mother, and is she involved in your fantasy, or is it the opposite, with fantasy acting as surrogate for a lack of comfort in reality?
This older italian woman sounds like quite the enigmatic character, especially to have left such an impact on your development. It's funny, sometimes, the things that stick with us through the years.
Avoiding the process of gaining new fetishes... is a rather wise decision, ahaha
I see what you mean; more the degradation and service than the object of that service.
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean!
A one track mind; lucky for you, there's no lack of related content for you to consume!
I imagine you sharing information while drinking probably makes you lose track what you mentioned and what you didn't. It's not like I've been guessing your mannerisms and look because I'm actually looking at you with hidden cameras, that would be ridiculous (I had already envisioned you as having them, but asked when we were talking about yoga).
slight poochiness
And yes, the bit of chub on the lower abs; it looks very inviting. I believe the scientific term for it is "squeeze zone". It includes the area where there's slight folds from under the belly and towards the pubic mound, but also the navel itself. Makes me want to drag my tongue across it and give it special attention. The fact that it's generally a point of insecurity is a bonus.
Death to all avatarfaggots
Do you have a comfortable relationship with your actual mother, and is she involved in your fantasy, or is it the opposite, with fantasy acting as surrogate for a lack of comfort in reality?
I have a great relationship with my mother, probably one of the only few positive relationships I have. The fetish used to be just focused on other moms and their sons and at a very early point in the fetish, I thought my Mom was unattractive, but that was just the Westermarck effect being active in my brain. At some point, I mentally overrode that, making my mother seem attractive and substituting her for the moms in momcest games/doujins.
This older italian woman sounds like quite the enigmatic character, especially to have left such an impact on your development
Truly. I actively get turned off by women wearing casual but intentionally revealing clothes when formal wear or anything at all that's modest is completely irresistible to me.
What is your oldest fetish?
Rape, ownership, hate. 
When I was around 10 I watched Lady Vengeance, saw the rape scene and at first I was baffled but grew to like it a lot.
Newest fetish?
Non-sexual gore, ryona, getting brutally killed. I like degradation so much that I figured the most degrading must be not even being acknowledged by a man as a sexual being, just straight up meat punching bag
Alternatively, when I want to include sex in the fantasy, I have to imagine the guy doing it either because of a lost bet w his friends or because I paid him, otherwise I cant see it happening at all. And even then I cannot imagine them being nice in the slightest, so its always a hatefuck, borderline rape. 
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
Voice. If he doesnt have a beautiful voice, I dont want him.
Yes, I can be rather loose-tongued and forgetful under the influence, as you already well know. Try not to torture me too much over it, if you're able... 
My, my, Anon. You're a deviant! Are you certain this is not a practical joke? Stomach fat? I felt I had a rather reasonable understanding of male desire, and with each new thread I create, you tear it only further to pieces! Calling it a 'squeeze zone' is so salacious, as well... getting aroused from the hesitancy brought about by deep seated insecurities is rather degenerate, Sir, and I implore you to introspect on your dark urges. Now, pardon me, I have to discuss something with my pillow for a moment.
AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!
Excellent news, Anon, everyone you hate will inevitably die!
Interesting, that's not what I would have expected! Having a good relationship, but only growing relating her to the fetish that clearly implicated her after a period of adjustment, it seems rather unusual.
Modesty driving you wild is a rather adorable weakness, Anon.
At first, I was incredibly confused, and then I gathered the context of your gender, and it began to make more sense. Your type is becoming shockingly common in recent times; I wonder if my younger sister, in aligning so much with the current generation, has similar preferences. I do hope she stays safe.

You know Anon, I think she may make an exception, just for you!
You sound like you have chosen a life of suffering... I am sorry for your coom.
At first, I was incredibly confused
Ah ye, sorry, should have added that
I hope your sister stays safe too.
I mean, Im an ugly loser shut in who doesnt socialize much and has 0 self esteem, so my fetishes/kinks are kinda understandable 
But if your sister is somewhat more on a normal side, I think she could be okay. Check on her sometimes if you have a good relationship. Maybe it could make you slightly less worried to know what shes up to.
You know Anon, I think she may make an exception, just for you!
But she put her clothes back on! I think I creeped her out. Hmm, but her face is very pretty too. Maybe I will approach her anyways
I'm in much the same situation, Anon, so as much as I worry for her, she tends to resist taking advice from me, as any wisdom I might possess clearly hasn't served me well in life.
Unfortunately, Anime Girl technology is very limited, so she is unable to communicate with you easily. The only other images I have of her are very dramatic and in combat, or more skimpily clothed, but seemingly upset, which I felt would have been a more negative message to communicate.
Are you certain this is not a practical joke? Stomach fat?
How lasciviously worded. I'd almost think you were teasing me~ 
I do think they're aesthetic, yes. I hope you don't mind.
As for you, there's no way you could possibly be into being pinned down and having your tummy kissed now, right? That wouldn't be too embarrassing for you; I'm sure you're not breaking a sweat over it or anything. Though, if your body temperature were to rise and I dragged my tongue across your body, I'm sure it'd be a nice way of cooling you off.
I must sleep soon. Night night, it was nice talking to you again
Oldest Fetish?
Midriff, as a kid I always felt funny when cartoon characters had chicks with midriff.
Newest Fetish?
Nursing Handjob, Thighjobs. Those are the 2 newest, as in a few days ago.
Most prevalent and significant Fetish?
I got several. Incest is a bigger one, Femdom (Gentle I don't want my balls crushed), older women in general get me kinda fucked up. I've also got breeding and creampie fetish, so much so that it actively makes me avoid porn where the dude pulls out and cums on the girl. I've got a bunch but the more I think the more I get lost.
I will never have a loving Big Sister gf who I may spend the rest of my days with
What is your oldest fetish?
Calf muscles/ legs in general. In old cartoon depictions of sexiness the erotic focus was commonly on the legs. To this day I start by looking at the legs when in eyeing up a girl.
Newest fetish?
Ropes, suspension, restraints. I just kind of like it from an engineering/biomechanic perspective.
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
Breeding, creampie, impregnation. From my first boner I understood what to do with it, it's simply hardwired. Sure, maybe it's not heady or sophisticated but its what my boner has always responded to the quickest. Other fetishes feel convoluted compared to this one.
How in the blue blazes is 'stomach' fat lascivious? That was the most unappealing phrasing I could conjure! Though maybe your unique appreciation for certain things reframes such words... gosh. Gosh. You really ought to find someone more susceptible to your teasing because I, for one, certainly don't mentally short circuit over the smallest implications of lustful intent. I'm simply immune to such attempts, due to being coolheaded and calm and collected by my very nature . Now give me some personal space to discuss things with my bedding.
I don't want to put enough As here to illustrate my point...
There was a time when nearly all female cartoon characters wore crop tops, I recall! A strange cultural zeitgeist to be certain.
I can easily see the appeal of this nursing handjob; it sounds deeply relaxing.
I hope you find your loving big sister gf, Anon, even if you may need to abandon hope of actual blood ties to find her!
Cartoons seem to be the origin of many of our most compelling desires.
Describe the biomechanic perspective! What is it, how does it work? Unless by 'biomechanic" you simply mean "combining bodies with machines".
Breeding is a very respectable fetish, you've no need to defend your preference, good Anon!
My eyelids are very, very heavy already, I'm afraid, so if I do not reply again tonight, I apologize! I'll continue in the morning if the thread lives, and if it dies, I wish you all a good night and an apology for the short outing.
we now have to keep the thread alive. quickly, we must theorize how op would react to having her crotch area kissed
Look at dis nigga, making it weird
I like to imagine she's quite hairy and musky down there. I've heard rumor her parents wouldn't allow her to have a mirror in her bedroom for fear she might become vain, so she must be quite attractive. That might just be me projecting my fetishes though. 
Oldest thing I can remember is googling the first names of women I knew. Don't know why I did it but it was then I saw pubic hair for the first time on Google images. I have always liked it very much since then. Newest thing was lactation. Titties alone are pretty fascinating but then they can actually do something? Sign me up please. I've always been very sensitive to light and smell, but the natural feminine scent has always been a big turn on. More specifically I like how women's armpits smell when they aren't spayed by deodorant. I've had the good fortune to smell used panties before and it was nothing short of ecstatic inebriation.
Just kill me now holy shit. Why are you like this anon it was so painful to read
sorry that you're a homo. that anon is straight and based but you are angry about it
What is your oldest fetish?
i think it depends on what you consider fetish? sexual fetish, or romantic kink or something else? the lines are kind blurry here
sexually, i think busty girls or creampies, i liked. i dont know if that counts as a fetish. or maybe asian girls? i dont know
romantically, stuff like stockholm syndrome and lovebombing. i remember reading books about that shit and feeling my heart race, since i was like 15, and im old

Thanks, you too anon.
However, I am not american and I am not entirely sure if that's the case generally (I could, of course, be dead wrong). In any case, is that neccesarily a bad thing?
Heh, no. Machine x human is cybogrism.
Biomechanics is the study of movement via skeletal and muscle systems(all natural, no wires or chips lol)
In this context it's to do with how limbs can be bound comfortably (or slightly uncomfortably >:D) given the constraints of each joints range of motion.
Considerations are on which areas of the body can be rigged as weight baring, which stretches are nice and erganomic, how to fully expose certain areas for later toying with.
For example if you twist the the thighs outward it's uncomfortable in a pleasant way, while shoulder twist is uncomfortable in a way thats unpleasant, rigging a whole body up in a sustainable way without cutting circulation or contorting them beyond what can be sexually enjoyed..it's basically an artform.

What is your oldest fetish?
Asian girls. My dad still chuckles about how when I was six (6) years old, the winter olympics were on, and he and my mom were watching them, and I paid not the slightest bit of attention to it until they announced they were going to show Kristi (sp?) Yamaguchi figure skating. at which point I dropped my legos or doodling or what have you and stared at her. And now thirty (30) years later, guess, what, I still have yellow fever. It was a thing way before I was old enough to even realize I liked girls.
Newest fetish?
Well, if you define "new" as a relative term, I guess you could say elves. That came from playing WoW. Which I started in 2007, sixteen (16) years ago. Most everything I can remember liking (there is a variety of stuff...) I've liked for more or less as long as I can remember. 
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
I don't know. It depends, I guess? There isn't one thing I'm always in the mood for all the time. 
Feel free to add anything else
I have no idea of the origin story of Asians, it was there before I had a memory. Ditto for fat chicks, it was something I felt oddly fascinated by before I knew what being attracted meant. I mentioned elves and where that came from. I've been attached to various anime series as they came along. I never thought of incest until Oreimo, since I was an only child, stupid fantasy I guess. There's been miscellaneous other random stuff.
The one girl I ever fell in love with (and who was a lesbian, damn it all) was Asian, I'm not sure to what extent that was a coincidence. I wasn't at all just those beautiful dark eyes though, granted, she *knew* me. We'd finish each other's sentences, know what each other were thinking. That's less coomer and more feels, I guess. I miss her, I can't coom to imagining fucking her, I have to imagine licking her pussy

Idk I'm sort of in a weird limbo now between liking soft femdom and gently dominating women. The trajectory is towards the latter though. I don't think I'll ever lose my love for big tits, but nowadays I more want to dominate and grope them than have them dominate me. Pic very much related

Incest then a bit after that, rape. I had fantasies of raping fellow female students in middle school everyday in class.

Big cocks, don't care about race.

A mix of big cocks, girls cheating/being sluts, and seeing chads with ugly girls. These turn me on like nothing else.

Most prevalent and significant fetish?
probably mature women.
i've been making an effort to meet more mature women on dating apps and have, to date, slept with two and jerked off on one. i'm heading home for the summer and i'm hoping to be more sexually active than i was while at school. i was kind of a nerd in high school so now that i'm a bit more confident i'm hoping to get some kind of psychosexual revenge by sleeping with former classmates thru dating apps. it sure is a strange world!
forgot to mention cheating porn. i'm always seeking real emotion in adult videos, which is why i find most non-amateur porn hard (hah) to get off on. cheating porn kind of cuts straight to an emotional high, except its the kind of dirty, ugly emotion i try to stay away from in my day-to-day life. recently, i slept with a woman in a committed relationship, and i'm kind of grappling with the morality of that. i figure she's slept with other dudes before so it's more her fault than mine, but does that make it okay? idk.

Probably women who act very cool and nature but also show affection and emotion bluntly and appropriately without holding anything back. Got into these kinds of women after realising that I'm better off not burdening anybody irl so instead I just imagine being in a loving relationship with a faithful mature beauty. I'm fine with his I am and where I am now since I like doing matchmaking my friends instead of trying to get a match.

You never know on 4chan. But anyway, good luck finding someone to act out your fantasies with. I'd offer if I weren't too scared of it going too far and getting arrested.
or perhaps it is a social contagen fueled by rapid acceptance of complete individual autonomy and normalization of sexual and gender conversations (this can also be applied to increase troon population)
Yeah understandable. I still dont get it tho. Why is assisted suicide not legal? If I wrote a note and/or recorded a video giving an enthusiastic consent to you possibly killing me, acknowledging that I might struggle, change my mind and scream but its just instinct kicking in and I actually want to go out this way, you should not be charged for it, right?
Depends on the location but for sure if you get seriously injured or even killed, the guy would for sure get arrested regardless of your consent.
Testosterone levels are also at an all time low for men. I'd suspect that's linked to it too.

Ass and breasts aren't fetishes. Arguably not even anus.
They're not even paraphilia they're just regular body parts that the majority of people are sexually attracted to
I KNOW, but w h y. It doesnt make sense to me
I think if you want to be killed by someone you should be able to do it, but equally if you at any moment change your mind, no matter if instinct or otherwise, the other party should stop. I don't really think it's possible to give consent for your future self to be unable to retract consent.
If I wrote a note and/or recorded a video giving an enthusiastic consent to you possibly killing me, acknowledging that I might struggle, change my mind and scream but its just instinct kicking in and I actually want to go out this way, you should not be charged for it, right?
Even if you were extremely enthusiastic about it, there is always the possibility that you were threatened to act that way. It's hard to figure out if you legally authorizing someone to kill you truly is authentic. Best to just not let anyone kill anyone.

Making girls pee themselves. The embarrassment and shame are so hot. 
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
Degradation and non con by far. If she doesn't like it or is forced/coerced then ill probably get off to it. Also really like misogynistic and domestic abuse. Like gaslighting and all that. 
Also got into beast cause I downloaded horse porn on accident over emule as a teenager. Stuff was named wrong often and you could end up with weird shit on accident. 
Something vanilla I really enjoy is a girls stink however. I love smelling and licking a girls armpit if she hasn't showered in a bit. 
Overall im into some fucked up and dark stuff but I always put my relationships first. I think I treated all my gfs well even if I peed on them or abused them in other ways. Wouldn't do it to someone I don't love and trust.

I think it's really my only fetish, though I suppose it can be subdivided into more categories. I want to play with leg bars, ropes, gags, blindfolds, all that jazz, spanking, hair pulling, slapping, alternate between roughly fucking her with only my own pleasure in mind, and edging her over and over while she begs to cum.
Then when it's done I want to pick her up, a quivering mess, and wash and clean her, tell her how much I love her and am proud of her. Cook her dinner while she sleeps, then when we're done cuddle with her all night.

I think all of my fetishes have been prevalent, honestly. What sticks out to me sticks with me! I don't think any fetish is more significant than another for me.
Thinking harder about it, I think I have a long list of fetishes in my head, but I have trouble remembering everything without making a list. I do not care enough to do so. Actually, are most of them even "fetishes"? Better look up the word in the dictionary.
A question for OP: have you ever had any intrusive horny thoughts in public? Or any moments where you randomly and uncontrolly felt horny and becmae consumed with lust for no particular reason?
Hello polish painpig. I love how deep your desire to be degraded goes. Too bad you caught that yellow fever. You could have paid for my plane ticket and hotel bow that you work.
But the regret/panic/survival instinct kicking in are unavoidable for normal suicide victims who decide on a more prolonged/painful method too, doesnt mean they dont want it ;-; ugh
Yeah I was thinking about it too, but then what is the other way? Thats why I would love for it to be legalized (not just in a humanitarian way like in Canada, but on your own too) so you go to the office, fill in the paper and are good to go lol but yeah I guess its just gonna stay a fantasy if I dont want to ruin the dudes life.

You'd never considered denial in that way? Oh, anon, I pity you, but I hope you've found a whole new way of thinking. You want a man to beat and fuck and use you; you need a man who'd turn his back while you beg for just another touch of any kind.
touch of any kind
Nah if it doesnt hurt I dont want it
I mean I did consider other denial stuff before, but ye I never thought how embarrassing and frustrating it would be if I said how much I wanted all this gruesome stuff, then couldnt actually do it and instead of having the guy continue regardless like I wanted, to have him stop, degrade and humiliate me for pussying out, essentially showing me how full of shit I am. I like that.
But anyways, I guess if assisted suicide isnt legal, pressuring and encouraging someone to kill themselves on their own is much better option for a guy because its harder to prove. Less fun for me, but gets the job done ig
Nah if it doesnt hurt I dont want it
It's funny that you think what you want would matter to the kind of man who'd also treat you as you hope.
degrade and humiliate me for pussying out, essentially showing me how full of shit I am. I like that.
That's really fucking hot, you are truly a messed up bitch. Suicide would be such a waste, though, even if you were coerced into it. Actually, if you were capable of being coerced into it you'd be much more boring than I thought and I'd be very disappointed.

You succeeded in your awful little scheme, but don't imagine such dirty things! That is not an area meant for kissing...
I try my best not to shame anybody for their behavior when posting here, even if some things are admittedly rather silly or fueled by an overactive imagination.
I'm sorry to shatter your dreams Anon, but I'm most certainly not 'quite attractive'. My mother was incredibly vain, and took all mirrors out of the house, (excepting the bathrooms), to prevent us from falling prey to the same vanity. The greatest compliment I've received on my appearance from a genuine individual has been 'there's nothing wrong with how you look', which I would categorize moreso as a consolation than a true compliment.
I find it amusing you refer to lactation as 'tits that actually do something', it's very amusing!
When you refer to stockholm syndrome and lovebombing, on which end of the manipulation do you wish to be on? They're quite intense, I agree; I was actively kept away from reading about such things, but I managed to access the forbidden knowledge regardless, and it was quite thrilling to read about. That a man would be so driven as to resort to trickery, it's quite sinful, but equally romantic, if not in a rotten, rancid sense.
My my, you seek out the women in the highest echelon of government intelligence? You set your sights mighty high, my friend. They certainly wouldn't be frittering away a perfectly good Thursday posting here, though... right?
As far as the possibility of a doppelganger, it's hard to say! I may have been the originator of said posts, or I may not have; I rarely manage to stay sober while posting, and as such rarely recall any of the contents of said posts.

J-jeepers... my, wow. My hands are shaking! You certainly manage to describe it artfully. I feel terribly fidgety reading about such things. I wonder, do men also wring their feet when expressing and expelling emotional tension? Please forgive me for not directly interacting with the concepts expressed in your post... I tried, but I was too embarrassed to publicly post such things, and it's far too early to wipe away my shame with wine.
Ahh. Fine, just between you and I, Anon, I'll speak, in hushed tones. I spend a portion of each of my mornings and evenings practicing Yoga and Pilates, and the experience of the pleasantly-unpleasant stretch is something I have held as a guilty pleasure for years upon years; it was the historical precedent to my descent into degeneracy, as it happens, the stretching tending to stir other urges inside me. I had never known that there was a realm in which both pleasures were combined... and the humiliation of exposure, the lack of freedom, a comforting torture I love to loathe... begone. You're an accursed practitioner of the dark arts, and I must resist your temptations!
Good gravy, sobriety is wasted upon me, if this is my behavior...
Youth is quite the universal allure; it's demonized often in modern times, but I can't say I understand why. The fear of abusive relations is not limited to the old and the young, it unremittingly occurs in relationships where both are young, both are old, any combination you can imagine. The true danger, (at least from what I have observed,) is that abuse has been standardized in relations; now it's just another forbidden fruit, while the old indulge.

I wonder if one day we will truly invent immortality, and if it will be a blessing or a curse... eternal youth is an enchanting concept to anyone, I'm sure.
I do believe that celebrities often age the most harshly, due to their hedonistic lifestyles; my brother's wife is thirty-one, and she looks just as radiant and youthful as she did at twenty two! She has gained some slight wrinkles at the edges of her lips, but I feel that it suits her well, especially as a mother.

just a side note, i appreciate your dilligence in your threads
Ah, that's a very cute story, Anon! I can certainly see the appeal of the asian aesthetic, (though this is somehow one of the first times I do understand one of you boys' desires!)
Elves are rather interesting! Does it have to do with their physique and gracefulness, or do the ears and peculiar eyes draw you in more strongly?
I'm sorry you've lost someone you've loved in such a way, I can't imagine the heartache! I am not certain whether it would be more or less difficult to accept if the reason were sexuality, as opposed to personal preference. In any case, I hope that your heart recovers with time.
You naughty Anon! If you brag of achievement, you must share the tale!
Encountering Doujins in your youth would assuredly rot the mind, I have no doubt. I can't say where my first exposure to erotic media may have been... I have several different memories, and recalling the chronology would be difficult. I do remember that before I witnessed any intentionally pornographic content, my family used to watch police dramas, and there were multiple episodes centering on the abduction and sexual assault of young women. Why I was allowed to watch such shows probably fell upon my mother enjoying them, and acknowledging the sinfulness of the act for us would be an admission of personal guilt, but they always stirred my belly in a sour way that I never managed to settle.
A simple man with simple tastes!
I can't say I've managed to internalize the differentiation between 'chubby' and 'thicc', possibly due to column A claiming the title of column B, but any clarification would certainly be appreciated. I think the evolution of your preference is rather natural for young men; when you're a young boy, nearly all women are in an authority position over you, and as such the fantasies skew in that direction. Growing older changes the dynamics, and your taste naturally tags along behind your new trajectory.
I'll probably be dead or old by them, so the best I can hope for is NerveGear VR or something.
I got into clubs and bars before I was supposed to. Gay men really don't ask about age if they're coked up and you're wearing a thong. I was young enough that I'm not going to say how young I was. I'm a grown man now though lol
NTA but if I could I would 100% but I would never do it with the current science we have.
Hooly mackerel! That... looks heavy. I feel it would be painful to be slapped with such a thing, let alone... something else.
You started young and dirty, I see; I wonder how early degeneracy effects the course of our lives?
I can imagine how difficult it would be to contend with such a fetish with no way of releasing the tension of desire.
A strange world it is indeed! I wish you the greatest possible fortune on your milf-hunting adventures!
I can understand that angle easily; betrayal is rather difficult to fake compared to pleasure or affection, and as humans, all we really desire is potency. As for facilitating unfaithfulness... I would not say it's guiltless, but in legal terms, you would be an accessory, not directly responsible. She's breaking her oaths; you're merely profiting from the betrayal she had already committed herself to enjoying. 
I've yet to see another Anon mention an interest in dominating larger women, but it certainly has a logical appeal from my perspective; the bigger the woman, the greater the domination, or so I would imagine. Or perhaps men view it the opposite, as the lesser the woman, the greater the possible domination? I shouldn't psychoanalyze, it's never ended well.
I imagine polygamy is a common desire among all people, as many problems as that tends to present socially.
Gracious! You're right! I hadn't noticed!
Thank you for your survey, Anon! Your post admittedly tugged at my heartstrings. I do hope love may become a concept nonfictional within your life, if at all possible.
How, pray tell, did you manage to find 'furries' as your first sexual indulgence? Are anthropomorphic cartoons to blame?
In your mind, what is a 'fundamentally incompatible relationship'?
Silent sex is quite interesting! I can see the appeal of that kind of sexual restraint, however. Do you prefer it to be towards the purpose of avoiding external detection?
The same kind of tech that can make you have artificial tissue can also be used to reverse aging, more or less.
Out of curiosity are you also into women like him? I get the feeling that there'd be a lot more lesbians if this sort of thing came out.

If I were my version of a hot girl I'd be straight.
How, pray tell, did you manage to find 'furries' as your first sexual indulgence? Are anthropomorphic cartoons to blame?
Of course! I 100% blame cartoons. I don't necessarily remember which cartoons, but I remember watching the arthur disney movie when I was really young, and there was that squirrel who fell in love with Arthur while he was transformed, and I really thought it was cute.
what is a 'fundamentally incompatible relationship'?
Interspecies relationships is the simplest form of it, especially if there're substantial anatomical differences. Like a human dating a fairy or an alien for instance. Other forms of it may be someone dating a ghost, or a machine, or (in my case), having an imaginary partner.
You want to hear about my hypnosis fetish? I really wanted to try it and finally found a first volunteer subject. I have since become better at it and have hypnotized a few girls online and also in person. Obviously they all were willing and curious about trying it out.
I don't know how spasms of the diaphragm would determine fertility, but I appreciate it nonetheless
What is your oldest fetish?
Women wearing satin or silk clothing. Had it since I was a kid.
Newest fetish?
Gentle femdom.
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
See oldest. Also, cheongsams, over-elbow gloves and poofy ballgowns.
So you're into men as you are then? Or are you saying that you'd want the procedure to also make you attracted to men?
Not every experiment in evolution is beneficial, I'm afraid the vast majority of them aren't.
Would Rosa from Brooklyn 99 match the description of your type, or do you mean something else? It was ever so slightly difficult to decipher your meaning.
Perhaps! I simply find no excitement in that entire wing of degeneracy, so I hope you all will forgive me if I avoid engaging with posts around such topics.
Oh, Anon... I know that feel, so very much. "I don't know why I am like this, I hate it but also somewhat like it" should be on my coffee mug. Though it would need to be condensed quite a bit, I've never been very talented at creating quips and one liners.
Sonic girls! Ahaha, that's rather amusing to me. They look like cereal mascots! Although, I do recall what the internet did to Tony the Tiger...
Oh, gosh, somehow, some way, the image of being made to pee one's self is much more disturbing to me than anything else you've written about! Shame is shockingly much more potent than fear, or at least it is in my experience.
Except for the 'intercourse with a horse', actually. That's beyond fear, that arouses sheer terror. It seems like quite possibly the worst way to die that I could imagine.
I can respect a man with a one-track mind! Gold star!
Well, the gold star is moreso awarded for that... very compelling evening you described. Have you considered, well, writing more lengthy sorts of things, short stories and the like? You seem to have a knack for picking the worst possible words, when it comes to my personal composure.
As it happens, I can never escape the dedication of coomers!
What about the ah, the... jeez, I really need to booze up, but drinking in the morning never ends well. The nipple-sucking... sheesh... how does it appeal to you? I don't understand why they've become a fixation point for men, though I understand why women would enjoy the stimulation.
As for your question... I'll have to answer you next post. In secret, so that nobody else hears!
OP sure is diligent, wonder if they will reply to everyone
Shhh!! Don't tell anyone!!
Come closer... keep your voice down...
To the oldest memories I can recall, my libido has been problematically active... it's caused me much grief. In my attempts to be a good Christian girl, I would always hold off on indulging for as long as I could stomach; this is likely what led me to my current reliance on 'riding the edge' as they say. So, as a natural consequence, I have many, many memories of containing unbearable sexual pressure in public, as I felt it was my moral duty. I have lusted after nearly every single man I ever encountered, against my better judgement and best intentions, I couldn't help my imagination running wild any time I was remotely near a man. I had an almost fanatical obsession with one of my older brother's friends, but that ended in an incomparable disaster. I have reached a mental breaking point while out of the house more than a few times, but I always sought out as much privacy as I was able when indulging in my weakness.
I'll say.
I just wish there was a cure to fetishes, but alas, mainstream medium is glorifying them in an attempt to pander to the big gays
I will reply to everyone with a few exceptions! I won't necessarily comment on every reply to sub-conversations between other Anons, and I generally avoid posts concerning male homosexual behavior or transsexual interests; I'll often give them a small reply, but those things are admittedly distasteful to me, so I hope you all won't mind if I skirt around them.
powerful effort. time to refresh the thread often then.
When I was 11 I was raped at a YMCA and now I just wanna get fucked in locker rooms but I don't really masturbate a lot so I don't have any new fetishes
Hasn't replied to me yet.
Well, the gold star is moreso awarded for that... very compelling evening you described. Have you considered, well, writing more lengthy sorts of things, short stories and the like? You seem to have a knack for picking the worst possible words, when it comes to my personal composure.
I do write, but I don't write anything sexual. While I have these sorts of genuine wants and desires for a relationship, I can also be quite a shy person. I know, a shy man, on here? Unthinkable! That said, the thought of writing something women find arousing certainly stirs something in me.
As for your question on nipples (though I am not that particular anon), I can explain my desire to play and twist and squeeze them from a domination aspect, though I'm certainly attracted to them beyond that, and that reason eludes me as it does you.
Well, there are potential means to cure them. Electroshock therapy might actually be one of those ways, but it's something you'd need to do for a long period of time and I doubt it'd be worth it for you. The kind of stuff that could cure a fetish with precision is pretty dystopian though, as the same kind of process could likely make someone do whatever they were then programmed to do.
What is your oldest fetish?
Difficult to say, possibly being worshiped by a harem
Newest fetish?
Blood drinking, giving and receiving
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
Both kinds of parental incest (not my actual relatives), yanderes, straight shota, breastfeeding, cuddles
That's mostly just my hentai taste though, IRL I'm probably a switch who's fine with a wide variety of different things as long as I get to suck her boobies.
Nta but on sucking nipples, this is absolutely just a primal drive. They look so tasty and I just want to nibble and suck and lick them. The fact that so many women seem to like it only drives me wilder.
what if the shock therapy works too well and I associate hiccups with the shocks and become scared of them
Oldest: tomboys, fit girls who can fight, muscular girls (I had those unusual preferences very early in life but sadly women don't give a fuck)
Newest: cannibalism, rape, war crimes, killing people, torturing people
Pantsing... That's a rather peculiar coincidence, ahaha... I had an unpleasantly impactful experience when I was in middle-school. Were you, per chance, in the thread where I described the tale some days (or perhaps weeks?) ago, or am I honor-bound to recount the experience for you here?
(I thankfully had the foresight to keep said story saved to a text document, as writing it out wasn't entirely pleasant for me.)
MORE tummy enthusiasts? This is a mad, mad, mad, mad world...
Armpits seem... borderline popular, as of this thread. The world is changing; am I not one of the cool kids any more? Am I no longer 'with it'?
I jest. If there is an 'it', I have never been in contact with 'it' even once before... sigh.
Thank you, Ms. Masochist, for keeping the dear Anons engaged during my absence! I hope you find what you desire in a relationship, in the most safe way possible, all while you eternally feel like you could die at any point in time with no way of preventing it. Perhaps a vigilante, a master manipulator using his powers for good, where instead of being an uncaring monster convincing you of his undying love, he's a truly good hearted man that warps your perception of him so effectively that you truly believe he sees you as lower than dirt and may discard you at a moment's notice.
Best of fortune to you, my dear! Or, worst, depending on how you look at it...
My goodness! Well, I wish you the best in achieving your desires.
There certainly are many obese women in 'Burgerland'; my mother being one of them. She claims she gained the weight in order to fight the sin of vanity, but I feel she simply enjoyed the excuse to be slothful in my father's absence, and the ability to blame people's aversion to her on something within her control.
Oh dear, oh dear! I'm so sorry for your frustrating situation, but this made me giggle quite a lot. Hiccups! How unusual!
I used to be into milfs when I was like 12 too
Now I'm not really into that anymore
Well from what I remember shock therapy has a tendency to "reset"(probably not the best word to use)how certain neurotransmitters/systems in the brain work. There's also other means of working with brains that aren't electroshock therapy, like just stimulating parts of the brain as opposed to shocking it. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation but I don't know of any research into any of this and fetishes. It's well outside what I'm familiar with.
It's merely a want, not a need, I ideally wish to be a normal person with an ordinary life..
In any case, I attached the image if you'd wish to confirm, you can simply choose not to, though!
What is your oldest fetish?
Literally depictions of aerial warfare. It was when I was about 11 years old. Probably my body reached already puberty, but my mind didn't, so I masturabted to the imagination of things moving fast and exploding afterwards like Air to air missles, but didn't have an idea what human sexuality was like.
Newest fetish?
Bunny-Suits
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
Sex while spooning/Sex while being completely under the blanket
Also forgot to tell you; Good morning! :DDDD
An oral fixation! Finally, a simple fetish that makes sense! Anon, you really must save me from these madmen, they're consumed by evil thoughts of squishy bellies and chubby legs... utterly demonic...
Aw, that's just cruel, Anon! Don't play with a boy's weaknesses like that.
As a consolation prize, Hic-Anon, I experience an uncontrollable case of hiccups any time I drink a carbonated beverage, which I do rather often!
Why... why is being washed with a brush... why... does it...
Oh my, that's quite a classic, going back even centuries! I must say, it's undeniably in good taste, Anon. Gold star!
Swimwear has always been shocking to me; even the 'modest' alternatives, one pieces, are so sexually charged! It's a skin-tight tank top with no internal barrier between yourself and any intimates, and it only becomes more revealing upon touching water, which is it's very purpose. I can't stand it! The handful of times I was made to swim due to social pressure, I always felt completely nude.
I am doing... sufficiently, I suppose. I've dealt with recent family stresses, dealing with my mother is always it's own little nightmare, but I did get to visit my brother and his family. It's nice to spend time with his children, and his wife is quite possibly the kindest woman in the world, even if I can tell she deeply pities me.
Latex has quite the allure! I can certainly not deny it's raw sexual appeal; it has all the issues I listed with swimwear, but ten times more extreme. I'm conjuring naughty daydreams of wearing inappropriate clothing as preparation for these threads... like a service uniform. I reallyt must put such pointless ideation out of my head...
Milfs seem to be gaining popularity in the larger world as well, it's quite interesting!
But I didn't do any of those so why did you skip me :(
Oh dear, did I, by mistake? Please direct me to your post!
Maybe you thought I was just replying because I had a reply in it?
anon, they are working down in order from top to bottom. they haven't got to yours yet.
Oh I see, my bad, danke
Oh, gosh, somehow, some way, the image of being made to pee one's self is much more disturbing to me than anything else you've written about
I honestly get it. The girl I did it with was mortified every time and begged and pleaded so much. But that made it thet mich better. She was so deeply ashamed and embarrassed when she inevitably pissed herself and soaked her pants. So yeah I'm not surprised. 
Well it was a lady sucking off a horse. My young brain wasn't ready for that kind of degeneracy. But it left its marks. And most of us have seen the Mr hands video so taking a horse inside of your holes is never a good idea. 
Why... why is being washed with a brush... why... does it...
Cause it's dirty. And dirty objects get washed. You don't want to touch something so filthy however. Hence the brush.
Oral fixation guy here...
I can't save you as I need saving myself. &lt;_>
I am doing... sufficiently, I suppose.
hope it turns better for you. family relationships can be a headache. moving out was the best thing i could do in this regard. although i miss some maid that would make me pancakes for a dinner so i had to do them myself since she's hornyposting on some internet chinese basket weaving forums again.
the looks are a major part, especially how it wraps and emphasises certain body parts. but there's also a sensation of a direct skin contact with this fabric and tightness of it can bring some idea of light bondage because you feel it constantly squeezing you in a gentle way. some people also get off to it's specific smell or even sound it makes (like here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39nQsjHqfrM). [Embed] there are people that love the way it makes them sweat but that's what i personally hate (i own few pieces so i know well).
I'm conjuring naughty daydreams of wearing inappropriate clothing as preparation for these threads... like a service uniform. I reallyt must put such pointless ideation out of my head...
or you could give yourself to this idea
Milfs seem to be gaining popularity in the larger world as well, it's quite interesting!
repressed (more or less) mommy issues could be a common denominator i guess. i always found lot of mature women attractive since i could remember but dating one (albeit for a brief time of about 9 months) unlocked new heights. but i'm not exclusive to them.
Office workers! That's rather cute, Anon. I have a folder of office ladies, I planned on posting them on some other date; I am curious, to Anons who have attended a few of my threads now, would you prefer I keep with the current folder I use to post, or do you like variation? It's difficult to find artists that create my preference in aesthetic, (incredibly sexual but rarely explicit), so it would be more akin to rotating a selection than new art each thread, but I figured I may well simply ask you all, considering how many of you I am recognizing with each subsequent thread!
You silly, impatient boy! I'll be with you any moment, please manage to wait a little while longer!
Of course, my Anon! It will be rather difficult to spin quite a large volume of 'something' out of a post of little content, but as always, I will give one hundred percent! Why did you ask for such a thing, I wonder? Are you a little troublemaker, only wanting to see how far I will go to appease Anonymous, or perhaps is requesting silly and meaningless tasks from hardworking women your fetish? Or, even more deviously, did you simply post this because it came to mind, and carries with it no further meaning! That would be truly devilish.
Jeez louise, Anon... you must r-really like kissing...
Thank you Anon! Pesticide-Free Parsley!
Cheating isn't very kind, Anon.
I'm sorry you've caught the NTR-bug as well; many of us suffer from it's allure. I don't think many men or women enjoy the fact that they enjoy it, but at least you're not alone in your trials!
Ballerinas are certainly incredibly graceful! Do you attend dance shows to indulge? Was someone in your youth a dancer?
Thank you, Anon! I appreciate your appreciation!
it's not cheating though. my bf is into it too.
What is your oldest fetish?
lolis
Newest fetish?
mesugaki is kind of cute i guess
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
im a lolicon through and through, anything else is second to that
Feel free to add anything else you'd like to elaborate on; origins of said fetishes, stories, and so on.
ive always liked young girls, im 24 now and love lolis the same as two decades ago
very cute anon
and i recognize you....
cute image but still distasteful
why do you find it distasteful if two people want to explore it?
office ladies are fine, have a weakspot for them too. so if you wish for some variety, go for it. i will stay the "random armored fighting vehicle guy"
NTA but it's distasteful in the same way scat is. To the majority of people it is inherently disgusting.
i dont like that its kind of hot...in a very taboo way. it might be fun if both are into it and theres no weird dynamic, but  it usually damages the relationship so i  repress it and [/spolier]blacklist those tags.
also my gf wouldnt feel very good if i brought up wanting to sex somone else
Ah, I see much more what you're meaning. I remember that part of Sword in the Stone as well, it was quite odd! I also have a weakness for this type of fundamental incompatibility, though I'm more enchanted by aliens and fantasy creatures than genuine animals, like the squirrel, or imaginary friends. What is it like having an imaginary partner, Anon?
I... I didn't know hypnosis was, well, actually real... how does... it work?
I was much more aware of human obedience training, as I've witnessed it's effect, but that's not quite hypnosis.
A high fashion fetish is rather cute, Anon! I hope you find a domineering fashionista lady in your life!
Direct me to your post!
I'm catching up, Anon! I'm gaining ground!
Dear me, you came right out with it, rather bluntly. I hope your mental health is alright, Anon.
I am much of the same, I need oodles and oodles of intoxicating liquids to make me bold enough to write the more detail-heavy tales of my personal experiences. It's incredibly shameful and embarrassing, posting any and all of this, but it's that shame that I'm chasing to begin with, on some level... do know that your writing definitely stirred feelings in me I'm not drunk enough to face.
I'm glad someone admits that sexual attraction is sometimes just... strange and inexplicable! They don't seem very alluring to me, outside of how much pleasure they give on the recipient's end.
Being worshipped by a harem... seems like it should be rather common. Blood-drinking is rather unique, though! How did you come across it?
How do nipples look... ay yai yai... tasty? I don't quite understand.
I've understood the appeal of sporty women since I was young; there was a very beautiful mexican girl in my school who was incredibly sporty, and incredibly popular. It's always made sense to me, because her social appeal was undeniably magnetic.
Your more recent preferences seem dark...
Jeez louise, Anon... you must r-really like kissing...
Not a one.
I am much of the same, I need oodles and oodles of intoxicating liquids to make me bold enough to write the more detail-heavy tales of my personal experiences.
If I were to write something a touch risque, would you read it and tell me what you thought? I'd be curious.
the taboo is kind of the appeal i think. the aspect of doing something i shouldnt be. but he likes being the one to 'allow it' kind of thing. its not weird or anything. going on tinder seems kind of seedy so the fantasy is with someone also shy and a bit awkward like a robot. we fumble a lot and explore and kind of are awkward about things and try and learn eachother. and then when i go back to my bf we can talk about it.
Pic related gave it to me
I want to suck and lick and bite all of a woman's body, nipples are just sorta the focal point. Plus, they are literally the first source of food a baby gets.
A high fashion fetish is rather cute, Anon!
You think so? Aha, thanks!
I hope you find a domineering fashionista lady in your life!
I hope so, too. Maybe one day.
What is it like having an imaginary partner, Anon?
From what I hear from my friends and their relationships, it's about the same as having a regular partner, minus the petty power games. Also I can take her to work.
Anime sex picture masturbate hot sexy
I checked the artist, there appears to be no anime sex masturbate hot sexy pictures created by them.
No hot sexual arousing sexy anime babe pictures artists??
So you're into men as you are then? Or are you saying that you'd want the procedure to also make you attracted to men?
No, not as I am, but I would love being straight as a girl. The thought of doing anything a guy as I am feels weird and has zero appeal for me.
I see! What have you turned to in it's stead?
Ah, yes, I certainly did make that post, though I haven't the foggiest when or where it may have occurred.
Ahahaha, the idea of you masturbating to something entirely unsexual with no understanding of the association the mind creates is rather amusing, Anon!
Bunny suits are a time-tested classic, I approve. Though I find the concept of them lethally humiliating.
I also approve of undercover cuddlefucking... it's a lovely mental image... g-gold star...
Good morning, Anon!
I can't imagine a more humiliating act... I feel terribly filthy just using the bathroom to begin with, being watched, and being forced to do it when I shouldn't... it quickens my heart and turns my stomach. I recall the shame of being a bedwetter in my childhood, and I can't imagine how much more intense the shame would be now that I'm grown.
It's filthy. Filthy filthy filthy. ...I'm so filthy...
Ah, I don't imagine that would be comfortable for the jaw, either. In any case, I'd avoid it like the plague; barnyard animals do not make good mates.
'Dirty objects get washed' will be on my mind all day, if not all month, if not longer... what the heck...
We all need saving, Anon :(
D-don't imply things! Don't imply that I may or may not be employed in your service and neglecting my duties! I'm certain that if I was I would do my very best!
Sh-sheesh... you're heartless, you know...
I, ah, I happen to sweat excessively, regardless of what I wear, so I don't think that would be an issue for me... I don't need more encouragement to indulge in degeneracy, I'm already terrible enough...
Ah, well, in that case it's alright, I suppose.
Consistency is a virtue, I suppose! You've made up your mind you stick to it!
Thank you for your input, random armored fighting vehicle guy!
I... I didn't know hypnosis was, well, actually real... how does... it work?
It's obviously not like it's portrayed in fiction. It's simply you being in a focused state where you're more suggestible. It works better on some people than others, the only way to see is to try. And obviously it's true that you won't do anything under hypnosis that you won't normally do. That being said it can still be great fun and also for erotic stuff. And of course there needs to be a level of trust.
Many girls are kind of curious about it and willing to try. Some find it erotic and are able to let go and be willing be a toy to a guy they find attractive.
That's... that's dirty, Anon...
Y-yes, of course, I would, but... maybe later in the evening would be better timing... I'm a better thread host with a looser tongue...
Ah, right, I forgot the new-wave kids anime had crazy fetish villains, ahaha...
You're welcome!
Well I'm pleased you're happy with her!
Very good Anon, gold star! 
Well... how is that different than simple obedience? It sounds like roleplay, to some degree, if a woman isn't actually being made to do those things.
What is your oldest fetish?
Big breasts
Newest fetish?
CNC, free use, domination (thanks /fit/)
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
Sweat, smell, armpit/pubic hair, fertility, weight gain/architecture (thanks /fit/)
Feel free to add anything else you'd like to elaborate on
One of my biggest fantasies is taking a cute passing troon to pound town in front of a smelly fujo nerd girl with fat tits. Then I'd fuck both of them silly in a big stinky fuckpile and knock up the fujo.
Now I dislike irl milfs but I like tall muscular big titty anime girls lol
I used to fap to normal porn but now I can barely look at those pornstars with fake tits and tattoos, almost all irl porn looks nasty and degenerate to me now
That's... that's dirty, Anon...
What is? Tell me, to what are you referring?
Y-yes, of course, I would, but... maybe later in the evening would be better timing... I'm a better thread host with a looser tongue...
I'll start writing something now and hopefully have something decent later on. Should be a bit of fun. What timezone (rough, if you don't want to be specific) are you in, so I know when the evening is for you?
I'm so filthy...
So what you are saying is I need to get thr brush and give this dirty OP a good cleaning? It is getting its filth everywhere!
Glad I left a lasting impression on you. Living rent free in someone's head is true power.
Well... how is that different than simple obedience?
It's not about obedience. That doesn't change, if you tell her to do something while hypnotized and she does it, it's something she would have done normally anyway. You're right in that it's not unlike roleplay, the difference being that if she's deep enough she can believe the roleplay herself. You could say that telling her a suggestion makes her feel like it's real and actually happening. Or that she thinks what I said is silly but for some reason does it anyway and can't help it. Perhaps something goes through her head like, "I'm hypnotized so I can't help it, this will happen".
Again, it is completely up to what she's willing to go along with.
D-don't imply things! Don't imply that I may or may not be employed in your service and neglecting my duties! I'm certain that if I was I would do my very best!
not implying anything here. if you see her around, relay her that she missed the licking out the remnants of the cinnamon pancake dough out of blender cup!
Sh-sheesh... you're heartless, you know...
why not just indulge in it? i'm always up for it, unless there are external... disruptions
I, ah, I happen to sweat excessively, regardless of what I wear, so I don't think that would be an issue for me... 
it's another level in a latex. as for me, i'm pretty much normal when it comes to sweating but wearing latex makes me drip sweat from behind cuffs and... that's uncomfortable, at least for me.
I don't need more encouragement to indulge in degeneracy, I'm already terrible enough...
is that some shame that you feel about yourself?
if you put it that way it does sound cute ill admit, as a lolicon im open to the appeal of taboo on things...its just always ended in tears and broken relationships when open relationships, NTR, or cucking was involved that ive seen
oldest fetish
milfs, specifically friends moms. Can blame my childhood friend for that because his mom was insanely hot and took me into her room to sleep with her when I had a nightmare, and of course she had no top just underwear. It will always stick with me.
newest fetish
probably masked/faceless women. Something about the disguise leaves it up to imagination and is more lewd that way.
significant fetish
I want to be raped by the woman I'm with. Wake up to her riding me, hoping she wouldn't wake me. Taking what's hers. The couple of women I've been with were submissive with vanilla concepts of sex and it's made me realize how much I wanted a crazier bitch in the relationship. Of course I've been too depressed the past few years to even try anything.
i dont want it to be ntr or anything nasty like that.. just exploring a taboo and doing something i shouldnt be. learning to kiss someone new and get used to the way they touch me. and then going back to my bf and feeling him touch me a different way. and slowly learning what he likes and trying to practice it.
Oh gosh, is that image accurately representing the effect of pregnancy on cup size? That's just... absurd! I couldn't fathom experiencing it.
What is it about sweat and odor for you? I'm curious how these things develop in the male mind...
Good golly, that lady is... well endowed!
...k-kissing.... kissing dirty girls... kissing dirty girls in dirty places... is dirty...
Don't write anything too filthy, Anon is already testing my sanity and threatening the brush! It's 3:22PM where I am at the moment.
Hail Mary, full of grace,
The Lord is with thee
Blessed art thou among women
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus
Holy Mary Mother of God,
Pray for us sinners,
Now and at the hour of our death. 
Amen.
I have lost all faculty to respond to this properly
Aw, drat. Hypnosis was rather exciting for the total lack of control it promised; without that, it's rather silly seeming, to me.
Ahh... I see. I apologize for the presumption, if I see her... I'll let her know...
When sober, I at least attempt to pretend I'm respectable. Such hobbies are sinful, and wrong. I feel shame for my hedonism but I'm incapable of living without it.
I rather enjoy uncomfortable sensations, I confess. I keep my apartment's temperature lower than is comfortable to live in, but I enjoy the chills and goosebumps. I catch cold often, but it bothers me little.
My my, your friends mom slept with you nearly nude? That seems rather daring of her! What age were you at the time?
I was only 8 or 9. She'd walk around the house constantly in a nightgown and her nips would slip constantly. It was the worst teasing for a young mind.
What about you pervy curious op? I want to know what perversions cause your mind to fog and short-circuit
oh no... OP was sent to horny jail. she will be forced to endure constant teasing at the hands of coomers with no release
...k-kissing.... kissing dirty girls... kissing dirty girls in dirty places... is dirty...
I'll kiss a girl anywhere, but I don't know what these dirty places you're referring to are? Enlighten me. 
I'm going for a...I hesitate to call it romantic, but sort of bordering on erotic/romantic story, thus far. I'm already getting a little embarrassed writing anything even a little dirty, though. Still quite fun!
What is your oldest fetish?
Pregnancy 
Newest fetish?
Otokonoko
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
Impregnation, pregnancy, birth
I've yet to see another Anon mention an interest in dominating larger women, but it certainly has a logical appeal from my perspective; the bigger the woman, the greater the domination, or so I would imagine. Or perhaps men view it the opposite, as the lesser the woman, the greater the possible domination? I shouldn't psychoanalyze, it's never ended well.
you're not really off, maybe this is a misread on my part but I get the impression there's a type of larger-built woman who doesn't see herself as feminine as I see her
i imagine that if i could make her feel more feminine (with my dick) it'd make my wannabe masculine ego feel greater
i didn't used to think like this much until i saw how much my first big exe loved it, leaned into it
ofc she was a foot shorter than me, and I've never dated a girl who wasn't a head taller than me, but there is this cute, built girl who drives a forklift at the local walmart, and I kinda wanna ask her for her number I just don't know how
I imagine polygamy is a common desire among all people
you'd be surprised
most guys don't advocate for it because they don't want to be the one who ends up with no one
it's fitting that it was practiced more and most successfully in a society where young men died in battles more often, and in times when wiping out tribes of people and taking their women wasn't against the geneva convention
I have more thoughts on this but don't feel like typing them out unprompted

Ballerinas are certainly incredibly graceful! Do you attend dance shows to indulge? Was someone in your youth a dancer?
I don't attend live but I watch them on Youtube. Yeah one crush of mine was a dancer but the fetish pre-dated that.

if I see her... I'll let her know...
thank you, much appreciated. also tell her she has a time until i learn to do all those things alone. then she has to bring something extra to the table if she wants to come back.
When sober, I at least attempt to pretend I'm respectable. Such hobbies are sinful, and wrong. I feel shame for my hedonism but I'm incapable of living without it.
sinful or not... just a question of an imposed morality. we talked about very similar topic in one of previous threads (i probably didn't identify as a random AFV guy then). but i mentioned that i like the process of finding out each other's kinks and fetishes. and overcoming individual's shyness is a part of the game. like a dam breach, if this rant makes sense (english is not my first language, as you may noticed already). so... if it doesn't disrupt your life routine, why deny yourself your fantasies that don't hurt anyone (i hope so).
I rather enjoy uncomfortable sensations, I confess. I keep my apartment's temperature lower than is comfortable to live in, but I enjoy the chills and goosebumps. I catch cold often, but it bothers me little.
that's something we have common. i also barely have heating on and it's not due budget cuts. my bedroom has a window partially open unless temperatures go below zero celsius. but the cold is a bitch, i hate runny nose. but! wearing latex in such temperatures is quite an experience. it transfers temperature in a new and different way than normal clothing. it's hard to describe such sensation though.
hmm, well i suppose anon. what you describe sounds sweet but thats either me being corrupted by your ways or you know how to spin words well...regardless of that i know for sure my relationship would end if i brought of external nakadashi sexo. and i dont think id enjoy my gf being with other males.
Gosh, yes, that certainly sounds like it would be frustrating as an adolescent coming to terms with their sexual nature!
As for myself, well... it's rather messy. To make two decades of self reflection short, the culture I was raised within made me feel deeply guilty about feeling any sort of sexual urges, which really just means that my mind associates guilt and arousal, which means I both can't become aroused without becoming ashamed, as well as being incapable of being ashamed without arousal following soon after. The majority of my sexual complexes orbit around that, in concept, but a few originate from specific experiences I end up seeking to replicate, or avoid, to recapture that same emotional response.
I don't believe I could survive such a fate!
I can't say such things! I'm stone cold sober! I have no excuses! None!
What would 'otokonoko' represent, Anon? Is it related to pregnancy somehow?
Ahh, I see. I'm rather short myself, but I could easily project how a more stereotypically masculine woman would find such indulgence in being made to feel feminine, and it's a rather cute mental image, isn't it? You should approach her, if you can muster up the courage! 
Yes, polygamy creates quite the difficult social predicament for all parties, especially in these modern ages when we've convinced ourselves that we've grown beyond our dirty apish instincts.
Yes, Anon, very good observational skills!
Intriguing! Are you able to recall the first time you learned of ballerinas?
There seems to be a pattern here...
Oh d-dear... I'll be sure to let her know that her employment is under jeopardizing circumstances...
Well, the sense of shame is completely unavoidable... but so is my quite honestly intimidating lust and hunger. Internally, there are unstoppable forces and immovable objects clashing, and I'm merely buffeted about between them. I will likely cave to my desires at some point, but I'm largely incapable of knowing when!
Your description of how latex effects your senses is... more fuel for the fire, I suppose. Is it really that unique? I also was very enchanted by the concept of constant light pressure, as you described before. Sheesh. Am I actually considering this...?
op are you muslim or amish

not that anon but this based fetish is crossdressing, not to be confused with trannism....
I see a bitch like this irl hired immediately god I wish

poet anon here. i missed your threads.
feeling like i'm in a moment of extraodinary clarity right now.
seeing the posts is making me want to cry. it feels sad to see you wallowing in this filth for some reason.

it's not an employment if it brings joy to you or others, is it? also you can be cute while doing the pancakes. and the rest of the dough is yours. no ps5 in my home though, only pc mustah race.
that must be and interesting dilemma to be in... i mean, i understand the pressure being between two sides... i must admit to finding this arousing. the idea of uncovering something kinky that is hidden under the guise of looking respectable. on the other hand, you can be both respectable and kinky, just don't mix those two together, haha.
you're talking to someone with a positive bias, of course. but yes, it's really an unique sensation to anything else you have probably experienced in this regard. it also changes the touch sensation, even a simple feeling other's palm warmth being spread in slightly different way.
the pressure is also quite unique. imagine wearing a few sizes smaller clothes but incredibly stretchy, that constantly, firmly but gently wraps your body. i personally find that feeling sort of... calming, perhaps? as if it switched some part of the brain that keeps me in almost constant state of heightened awareness. i'm not an autist but i guess that's what autists can feel with weighted blankets.
Sheesh. Am I actually considering this...?

Very perverted and very romantic is what I like. As for interaction, I'd try to drop subtle hints about their place in the relationship and hope that he responds accordingly.
interesting talk of the latex and feelings.
i wish i had some way of really turning any lust into unpleasant pain. 
not a big fan of such things, but they do help with desires.
i always find the account of francis de asissi throwing himself into a thorn bush to fight a temptation he felt amusing.

Oh gosh dangit, is this technically flirting!? This could not be a worse realization. Golly. Shoot. Heck. I'm just worked up, you mean boys let me be! Don't stir my mental pot in such a manner!
Hello, Mr. Poet
Though it may not be as eloquent, the answer is that I can't help it. I had an issue as a child, there was nobody to assist me in adapting a mentally healthy understanding of it, and now it's too late to change, so, here I am, warped and weird. It's my lot in life, and I have accepted it as mine; you should learn to accept it as well, or it will drive you mad.
I'm sure, but without the idea of it being powerful and at least difficult to resist, the luster of the fetish is dulled quite a bit, for me at least.
The anonymity is essential to my enjoyment of this type of posting as a hobby, I'm afraid. My threads are relatively easy to spot, though! If you want to discuss it, feel free to ask questions... here... in front of everyone. 
I swear it, I am my own worst enemy...
It certainly seems to be the case! Something something, history is a cycle, fall of rome... smarter folk than I could regale you.
If you'd like to meet her, do it! It's terrifying and it could go horribly wrong, but life is full of misery and shame, so I feel it would at least be worth risking it when there's a chance of victory and joy for what you desire! If you're polite about it, I assume she would at least be polite in her rejection, though I can't say for certain how a stranger may behave.
N-no... you have to rescind the request... this isn't how it was meant to go...
It seems you've found some volunteers, Anon!
Well, I certainly hope it helps coomers, that would make me feel a little more cheerful about my behavior here.
Stockings? The sheer kind, or the tube socks that you see in so much media?
thanks anon, its a very cute pic. pegging is a pure form of love between boys and girls
Isn't the harem part a red flag?
no its not....id like to talk to you. i prefer discord but femanons usually dont share those
I was under the impression that employment existed mostly as a legal term...
I don't actually care for playstations, I'm not much for video games, I'm afraid.
Interesting and torturous, to be sure. It's hard to have your heart torn in two directions. My needs are self conflicting, it's rather upsetting, until the moods align, and the misery feeds into the pleasure, and I get caught up in this terrible loop...
Ahhh.... do you... do you know where a person might even shop for... such outfits?
I have the opposite issue, where emotional discomfort turns to lust within the blink of an eye; it's terribly difficult to wrangle myself!
the idea of it being powerful and at least difficult to resist, the luster of the fetish is dulled quite a bit
Like I said, it's all up to you. It can be powerful and difficult to resist, but that's if you want it to be like that deep inside.
Oh, the thread is still up. Moth-kun's been busy
Fetishes? Creampies, impregnating, impregnation, breeding, no condoms, sperm, semen, seeding, cumming, internal cumshots, pregnancy, getting girls pregnant, not pulling out, ejaculating inside, fathering children, fertility, nut seeping out of a freshly fucked puss.

we're all persons of unclean lips, amidst a people of unclean lips.

i know it doesn't feel like that, too. it feels too permanent to ever be cleaned.
The sheer kind, or the tube socks that you see in so much media?
All of them! Leggings too I guess. And oh boy fishnet legwear is exquisite
i wish i had some way of really turning any lust into unpleasant pain.
it's the opposite for me. i don't like being drenched in sweat after few minutes in a latex. but i also have it connected with other, more pleasurable things.
so let's abstain from calling it an employment. what about... mutually beneficial coexistence?
good, no "mum said it's my turn now" situations. but to be honest, i rarely play games either, only some simulator games for few hours a week. i have a busy schedule filled with work, gym,... and also... among others... home chores. aaaand when i finally have time, i simply don't have the energy required to fully indulge in them. being adult is boring. stay away from it.
perhaps consider breaking out of this loop by embracing your desires be it alone or with someone else who would accompany you along this way? i also had some kinks and desires wishing so much to fulfill only to realize they weren't such a big deal for me once i experienced them. this freed me of the lustful fantasy and helped straightening up the direction of others.
Ahhh.... do you... do you know where a person might even shop for... such outfits?
i do but i'm afraid we're on different continents. i know few proven european shops but know nothing about US. if there's anything i could advice... start with something smaller. latex tends to be quite costly so you don't want to shell money for something you find out you don't like. go for stuff like gloves, stockings, perhaps underwear. just to get the idea about the feeling.
i'm quite sleepy, so this is my last post for tonight. i bow to your capacity to follow discussions with other anons. anyways, have a nice rest of the day and thanks for the talk. see you in future threads.
its naughty and thats my appeal in it i think. this idea of having small, gentle moments with someone and knowing i shouldnt be doing it. and going from learning how to kiss him to embracing and cuddling a bit more. and then eventually knowing i shouldnt do it but locking my legs around his waist. then as he imprints himself on me, i have my bf to go back to and he will ravish me after.
What is your oldest fetish?
No idea, wish I could tell you. Probably just mutual love or cuddling or something really soft like that, creampies and unprotected maybe? Idk I'm reaching.
Newest fetish?
Choking, with me on the receiving end. I'm not super proud of it, but a woman being so into me she damn near kills me turns me on and I don't know why. I would pretty much at least try anything a woman asked me too if she honestly and truly liked me, even if it's a bit taboo.
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
This is gonna get me flamed, but yandere. I'd like to say it's a new development, but recently I stumbled across my post history on my old steam account all the way back from middle school and without going into detail I think my wiring was always a bit off.
I've been cheated on multiple times and would never think of doing that to another person, I've put so much effort into relationships only to be used as an atm, and I've been in love with my best friend for ages and even watched her get in and out of bad relationships but don't want to ruin the one constant she has in her life by asking her out because she 1000% doesn't see me like that. The thought of a woman in my life who's so insane that she can reciprocate the love I'd for her in intoxicating, cause her insanity would mean I never have to question if she'd leave me or not. I know I'm not perfect, but with a yandere I could just be myself, which might not be enough for anyone else but that's somehow perfect for her.

The issue isn't complex, just what I've already been detailing in my posts here. I truly have no interest in having some sort of intervention, though, so ask away if you have curiosities, but please don't imagine any future where I somehow recover. The ship has long since sailed on that particular possibility.

As now seems to be a repeating curse, Anons have kept my threads living long after I intended them to, leaving me bound to replies for over twenty-four hours... it's exhausting...
Is it just an exciting thing for your mind, to see materials strike out the shape of a leg for you? I've always been befuddled by the appeal of 'thing wrapped in a thing' from the viewer's perspective.
Being adult is very dull. I wish I were more able to indulge in childish hobbies, but unfortunately, my life is entirely bisected between work and whatever psychological complex compels me to act in such a degenerate fashion.
I don't think you quite grasp it. Rejecting my desires makes me feel frustration, which arouses me, which then makes me feel shame. Embracing my desires makes me feel shame, which arouses me. Two roads, one destination; there's no breaking out of the loop, the loop is all there is to explore.
Sleep well, AV-Anon! I'll have to do my own research... shamefully...
You explained the appeal of a yandere very well! I hope for your sake that the concept exists in reality, because as far as I'm personally aware, women like that are more akin to my mother. An obsession with control and having it all, but lacking any true affection or loyalty.
AI art is rather interesting! Does the AI-aspect create more enjoyment than hand-made art, or is it simply the accessibility?
Do you know how you acquired such an anal fixation?
This OP is the best. Very fun thread!
what do you think of some of the things i said above, OP?

Right? I liked the late night that is, 10-11pm horny posting, with the thread dying by the morning. Perhaps there's a positive side effect to interracial bait spamming, which is making these threads more concentrated and personal by making them archive faster.

Best way I can explain it is a slavery/domination fetish.
Feel free to add anything else you'd like to elaborate on; origins of said fetishes, stories, and so on.
Obviously wouldn't and couldn't do any of this stuff. I assume my fetishes originate from my sadism.
As intense as this video is likely meant to be, I was utterly fixated on the man's hat throughout. I haven't seen someone wear a backwards baseball cap unironically in a very, very long time, and I kept flipping between giggling at it and gasping whenever the girl was punched.
As far as the conversation about consensual NTR? I can't weigh in too heavily, I've never been loved. That makes commenting on how much I could condone straining that love with informed adultery rather difficult.
I preferred the threads that way as well; posting multiple nights in a row wouldn't be much of an issue if they evaporated into the wind coem midnight, but these marathons really sap my strength, and I need more and more time to recover from the mental (and, at times, physical) exertion.

There's occasionally a respectable amount of creative writing, or at least a vague pseudo-roleplay-conversation about the concepts, which I find rather enjoyable.
Oh dear... I'm happy you're spreading your creative writing wings, but now I'm getting nervous, ahaha...
I maybe, possibly, maybe, would be forced to tell you, possibly, later in the thread, after I've had quite a few more drinks, if the thread is even still alive, and if you're even here to remind me... sheesh... 
Your fetishes seem rather dedicated to coziness and comfort, which I can certainly respect!
Ah, I see. I don't know, I'd rather just make my own fiction with it. I've thought about it before, that or I just play a game with that as a part of the game.
which I find rather enjoyable.
From which perspective?
I've never gone truly looking for erotic games, considering I don't care for games in general, but it's possible the eroticism could make up for my general lack of interest. I feel the search would be aimless though, as I imagine most games would be made for a male audience?
What do you mean by perspective?
Not all games are made for a male audience, although there definitely are plenty. You can usually identify which audience it's made for from just a glance, the more ambiguous stuff may require reading the description of it all. Text based stuff as a general rule is less likely to be for male audiences.
What do you mean by perspective?
As the person enslaving, a slave in those stories or as just an observer.
I want to pin you down and fuck you raw until you can barely mumble a response. I want to see you fully embracing your shame, getting lost in it. I want to see you quiver.
It's your fault I'm this horny and someone has to pay for it
There are text based games? I used to love the 'choose your own adventure' novels at the library! That would be a rather fun format for erotic stories!
Ah, I see. Well, I'd say a mix between observer and the... slave, I suppose. It's a bit difficult to imagine myself being involved in, I get... antsy? It's something like fantasizing stage fright, when I attempt to mentally insert myself into a position, if I get too flustered I'll be incapable and find myself abandoning the attempt entirely...

Traps and trans stuff here lately
I need more and more time to recover
Yeah, I need my bed time. I also feel like I miss out. (I'm also not one to bump. I always sage, because it feels polite).
Thanks anon! Not super fond of the whole part where they're obsessive and controlling without loving you as well, I guess I want to have my cake and eat it too! Looking to my past though, I obviously have a pretty bad taste in women if I get cheated or ghosted every time. Focusing on my hobbies and my work/personal projects till I ever date again, but dating is so transactional and impersonal I'm not really raving to take part in the rat race anytime soon unless it's with someone special, and even then I'd rather be friends first cause I don't want to waste intimacy on someone who doesn't reciprocate.
Thank you for being so kind and cozy to everyone weird inner demons, you are a very kind person and I hope whatever your doing in your life right now goes well for you &lt;3
Wait, this is a woman? I was talking to a woman??
... Woof. Woof. Woof. Ruff. Arf. Arf. Arf. Woof. Woof
There are, probably the most famous of them(the text based games that is, not necessarily female audience oriented games) would be "Corruption of Champions" which is an old one. That game centers heavily on transformations, corruption(like the name implies) and a lot of dom/sub stuff. I don't know if you'd like that though, I skimmed the thread and you mentioned a dislike for trans/gay content. You could avoid said content fairly easily if you know what you're doing and/or if you play a female character but it might not be to your liking. If you wanna look into pornographic games though then f95zone.to would be a site you could use. You'd want to make an account(you should know to use a properly anonymous username/email, I hope) and click the "Latest Updates" button. It opens up a better search feature for that forum for games, media, etc.. You can insert tags to include, exclude and so on.
It's something like fantasizing stage fright
Is it purely being flustered or is it something akin to shame too? That's fairly odd and I hesitate to call it wholesome, but it comes off that way.
I'm happy you're spreading your creative writing wings, but now I'm getting nervous,
It's not particularly kinky, and only relates to my specific fetish (Domination), which I think comparatively is fairly tame. It's me that should be nervous.
I shouldn't be on this thread all day if I'm just reading it... Goodbye op, I've actually put in the effort to make myself look somewhat better since the first one so I have to thank you for getting me closer to the dream.
I'm sorry you find yourself afflicted with a fetish you don't wish to have, Anon, if there were anything I could do to soothe your mind I would... 
I once tried to start the thread earlier in the day, around now my time, and have it end around midnight, but it died rapidly, before it was even dark out! It wasn't very enjoyable, since I get aroused more and more as my preferred bed time approaches, so I effectively had to babysit the thread through the dull period, and was left all alone once I was finally hot and bothered. When I start it later, now it carries to the morning and I just feel drained, having to respond for a full day.
I ran out of steam hours and hours ago, but I feel held here regardless, ahaha...
I'm glad you found some comfort here, Anon, and I hope someday soon you find the lady you want to love, who will love you back without any catches or conditions.
Awooo awoo and all that.
Ah, thank you for the information! I doubt I'll indulge tonight, I'm massively overextended as-is, but I'll file it away for my next lonely night!
I always feel shame when I masturbate, but I suppose there's two flavors of shame I can experience? One is a moral shame, with an imagined authoritative voice berating me for being so terrible, and the other is a more instinctive shame, where even if my morals didn't object, I'd feel hesitance to indulge in whatever lay before me due to the intensity it carries... like my inner voice, a self-critical voice that is still very much my own mind, being in disbelief that I've sunk so low, or something to that effect.
Why should you be nervous? I won't be mean about it, I swear!
If I've helped you in some way, I'm glad, and I wish you all the best!
Ah, thank you for the information!
Here's a bit more, mainly just some advice for if you do search for stuff on there. Below the tags on their search feature is a "Prefix: Other" category that you can open up. VN(Visual Novels) don't count, tag-wise at least, as text based but are often oriented more for female indulging. I'd recommend looking through stuff like that and just excluding the kind of content you don't want(like gay, futa/trans, traps, etc.) and including "female protagonist" for something from a female's perspective. Also it's safe to assume anything with 3dcg is probably trash, at least for over 90% of it.
Oh, also, Japanese games have a high frequency of being female protagonist oriented. You would likely enjoy a lot of those too but you'll need to either change or locale which is what I do and it avoids bugs/crashes or get a locale emulator. It's simple enough to change your locale, just might be a bit of an unintended dog whistle if someone notices it on your computer.
and the other is a more instinctive shame, where even if my morals didn't object, I'd feel hesitance to indulge
That's exactly what I was thinking about.
oldest
feet
newest
castration, women sticking needles in my testicles, women humiliating me for being circumcised, women humiliating me for having ugly incel genetics and never being able to have a wife or kids
i dont even watch porn or masturbate anymore. I think the decades of women being mean to me, making fun of my looks, and never being good enough to date or love has ruined my mind.
Ah, the tip on how to find female protagonist is very helpful, as well as the tip about 3DCG. Thank you again, Anon!
Why did you think of that type of shame, Anon? I'm somewhat curious!
Aw, Anon :(
The issue isn't complex, just what I've already been detailing in my posts here
would you mind repeating yourself? i don't quite connect the dots from your childhood to it evolving to this.
i have a memory of a few events you told, like gym class.
why didn't you respond to me being helplessly horny I'm hurt
and I kept flipping between giggling at it and gasping whenever the girl was punched.
you get more endearing by the post, anonette. kek.
AWWW YEEAAA AWW YEEAAA I JUST BURIED AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER FUTURE GENERATIONS WILL WONDER ABOUT THIS WONDROUS FOSSILIZED PEARLESCENT STUFF AND SELL AN OUNCE OF IT FOR TREE FIDDY GORILLION
women sticking needles in my testicles
how the fuck do you even get that going, just reading it makes me squirm.
will never get my saviour complex actualized by saving anonette and making her a happy woman
on the flip side, i'm glad i don't even get an urge to indulge in this coomposting. feels dignified.
Happy to help, fellow degenerate.
Why did you think of that type of shame, Anon? I'm somewhat curious!
I'll tell you if you can answer my questions for you real quick: Do you think girls would ever be interested in playing porn games with their significant other? I've had a weird scenario for quite a long time where, if I ever did get with someone, we'd just be lewdly dressed and she'd be on the computer. The consequences for whatever lewd game she was playing would then be acted out, as a weird kind of game. Do you think something like that would basically be impossible to get to happen with a girl?
one time a woman added me on discord and it was the only woman to ever treat me like a human. So she asked me to do it since thats what she is into. so I bought needles and stuck a few in my balls on cam like a degen. but she was just using me for money and that kink, turns out she had a bf the whole time so I had no chance of dating her.
What is your oldest fetish?
being tied up...
Newest fetish?
having a boyfriend stolen from me
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
cuckqueaning/humiliation lol ssssssssss i am worthless
oh hey its moth-chan again
oldest
I can't honestly remember
newest
bbw. Chubby ex and all that.
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
definitely breeding kink. My ex, the gal I told you about, got me into it pretty bad. We had unprotected sex quite a few times. When one of her pregnancy tests came back negative she sounded sad and said "but I'd like for you to impregnate me."
Sending hugs bro, that sounds rough. Seriously though, you deserve to have your balls, don't let anyone convince you to get rid of them. There are communities on Reddit specializing in doing that kind of stuff DIY style if you REALLY wanted to but I sincerely from the bottom of my heart hope you keep your nuts attached to yourself. You only get one set, and even if you're super turned on by it nothing is worth being so horny over you only get to do it once.
wretched and gruesome.
you shouldn't be letting basic feelings be manipulated like that.
you can find proper love elsewhere.
and was left all alone once I was finally hot and bothered
Awh. I was at my limit of directed horny posts that day. I'm sure you know what I mean.
I feel held here regardless
I recommend you take a trip to your local blockbuster and return some video tapes. Could put up a sign saying you're away, or something. Your tethering to courtesy responses is an unfortunate hinge you must unhinge from yourself.
As intense as this video is likely meant to be, I was utterly fixated on the man's hat throughout.
Hahaha hat. Man I'm glad im not the only one. It really distracts you cause how ridiculous it looks. Makes the whole thing seem like satire. But shock collars are hot and so are love punches.
What is your oldest fetish?
licking and other such stimulation. there's something that seems just so hot about doing something more arousing to my partner, like nibbling the ears, licking the neck, light biting.
Newest fetish?
same enthusiasm but from the other side.
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
both.
ngl i'd play that if i were a woman.
No i really doubt I can find love anywhere. She was the only woman who was willing to talk to me in my whole life. i wouldve done anything to keep the feeling I got when she would talk to me. the odds of finding another woman willing to talk to me are slim, especially now that im even more of a freak than before.
Glad to hear it, anon. I personally like the idea of teasing them while they play and tenderly feeling up parts of their body. Leaving them a bit on edge and wanting more.
then embrace that. why look for something you cannot find? why set yourself up for abuse for a crumb of anything?
it's pathetic.
me and my bf read eroge together. does that count?
I guess that's pretty close. I enjoy the idea of giving them more agency and teasing them out to indulge more than just reading a story though.
ever slept with a man?
because id rather be abused and feel loved for a couple minutes than to keep suffering in isolation for the rest of my life. I know its pathetic but I dont really care. im never going to be happy unless I can get a relationship.
anonette is a glowie, she likes the black highlighter
OH SHOOT I BLACKED THE WHOLE POST
don't brag about being better than the coomers in the coom thread
why not? just because it's a coom thread?
there being mud doesn't mean the pigs should roll in it.
Never slept with anyone, haven't even had a first kiss.
It's alright, OP. I don't actually think I'm going to get a GF anytime in the future, let alone one who I could be comfortable with. I'm actually fairly like you in regards to "and people terrify me." Just switch it from terrify to make me really uncomfortable and that I probably am undiagnosed for AvPD. As for your question before, I've felt that instinctive shame before when considering certain things. I'd say that sense of shame in me is very strong.
Ahhh! It was a mistake! Error! Error! I'm sorry! Waa!
Ahh! This is so brazen, I'm not sure how to engage! Abort! Abort!
Jimimmy Cricket... did I really stir you up so badly? I know how it feels to have so much tension in your belly you don't know how to release... I suppose it is my responsibility after all... can I write you something to make up for it?
As I said, it's nothing complex or really all that unusual. I was young, I had sexual impulses, and the only was I knew how to endure them was to compartmentalize and feel shame. There are many specific reasons I have certain fetishes, or reasons I have no friends, or why I stay inside, but my greatest issue is simply that. I had an active libido and no healthy way to cope with it's demands.
I giggled!
Oh... Anon... I'm so very sorry to hear your tale. I don't know what to say :(
Well, while I'm sorry you feel held back from doing what you wish to do, don't brag about being better than the coomers in the coom thread... that's silly.
Anon, I really wish I could tell you, but I have no dang clue. I never had close female friends in school, and people terrify me. It seems like the type of thing that the younger generation of degens would engage in, but I'm not sure if a zoomer-coomer-gf is attainable for most, and all I know of that type is from social media, which is notoriously fictionalized.
Well, the directed ones are a bit tough to handle, regardless, and I really do mean it when I say I don't ever wish these threads to become that cult-of-personality style of thread, so the more generalized, the better... even if it's personal in your own mind...
I didn't reply to every post initially, but then an Anon said he was sad, and now I'm emotionally compelled!
learn to enjoy being alone.
solitude is a great little thing once you start to like it.
then what you coomposting for?
go be a chaste man for your future wife.
Write it as foward and honest as you can.  I'm throbbing at the thought and have been at edge for an hour. End me with it
I cant have kids by myself, and i am too much of a hopeless romantic to give up on having a wife one day. being alone is not an option. I got on all the dating apps recently and am hoping to find someone who is at least a little nice to me soon, because i cannot take the loneliness much longer.
future wife.
Anon, I... I'll be very blunt and forward with you. I'm an autistic mess, a NEET and there is no real hope in me finding someone or getting my life together in general. I've tried to meet girls, especially those who're in situations like mine, but I'm not someone they like. I'm a weirdo -- and no, I don't mean as a coomer(I never open up about that shit with anyone anyhow) and I don't coompost or act horny around them or do anything like that. I'm just that autistic, odd and unappealing to them.
Thank you for your consideration.
if you want a family you won't find someone willing nor capable in dating apps.
are you really this delusional? you've said you're a wretch, but why are you looking for people who'd like a broken ruin of a man, instead of getting better?
a "hopeless romantic" who puts needles through his testicles on behest of some random woman. what a joke.
if you settle into your circumstances, there really isn't any hope of it.
it's wholly possible to get your life together.
even if you're all broken, i'm sure you can make something pretty with the pieces.
i dont know what else to do to get better. I already make more money than most, do everything i can to look better by lifting, fashion, skincare etc., i have hobbies and interests. still no women will talk to me. Id do anything to have a relationship but nothing i do is ever enough. what else am i supposed to try at this point?
I second this notion, you go man. He a great guy.
It's a lot to get into but between circumstances not in my control, personal issues I'm going to keep private and what little options I have left, I can just say that even if I succeed in doing well with what I've been working to do that I won't be living a happy or successful life. My life won't include a love-life. There's not going to be a happy ending with a loving wife, what's far more likely is that I'll at least be able to be content with myself and not feel like such a failure.
well, what do you think makes you the freak you define yourself as?
are you sure you have all those things? i've seen several pseuds claim to have interests and hobbies.
start by looking for women somewhere else. or, better yet, to not look for them.
do things where you might get in contact and just keep talking to them until you connect to someone.
book clubs, theatre, art classes, etc.
if you really are interesting, someone will take a liking from being a colleague.
Have you tried eating the book of stoicism and living for yourself?
https://youtube.com/shorts/9eOXN-1jtu0?feature=share
It was very funny looking; almost like an SNL sketch parodying the act, somehow, ahahaha...
I do love the idea of shock collars, as mental conditioning is a weakness of mine thanks to a very regretful memory, but I'm more hesitant on love punches... I'm very delicate and not pain resistant at all. I suppose human nature is to adapt, though, so given time, I could learn to adjust... I just don't know if I would ever desire to do so.
Luckily, I'll never have to face the choice!
I approve of your simple love of foreplay! Gold star!
It's like going to McDonalds and saying "Ho Ho Ho, I hate burgers and burger eaters are stupid!"
Whether it's true or not, if you don't like burgers, why are you at McDonalds? Let us eat burgers in peace!
Aw... I'm sorry you know that feel, Anon. I hope it leaves you one day soon.
Aww... heck. I thought you'd went to sleep. Agh.... fine! Okay!
I am a dirty girl and you should NOT kiss my dirty places, such as, including and not being limited to.... You're soo mean to me... my TWO nipples, my genitalia... no, he won't be satisfied with that...aagh! my p... pussy... my butt... you boys keep talking about armpits, those are dirty too... my tummy is dirty, my lips are dirty, in fact, everywhere is dirty, and you should kiss nowhere at all, ever! I hope you found this informative and educational from a scientific perspective and an external objective viewpoint, I'm certainly mostly not taking this personally, and it's not getting to me at all, and that's all folks, okay, nothing to even see here at all!
It took me twelve full minutes and three entire cups of rose to muster up the boldness to reply, you know. You're a scoundrel. A troublemaker. I have never said anything that vulgar in threads before, I don't believe, so you should be ashamed of yourself!
why are you at McDonalds
to make burger eaters see they are getting their arteries clogged and invite them to come out and run in the park.
But that's rude and nobody appreciates it! Please cease your undesired savioring!
yes I have all those traits. It doesnt seem to matter though because im too ugly for women to be willing to talk to me, and im losing my mind after being alone for so long. Ive tried joining clubs and organizations, but none of the women there want to interact with me.
driest humor ever and in the midst of a coompost. absolutely lovely.
and quite hilarious.
i'm very delicate
like a little porcelain doll, sat atop a stand.
one which i cannot reach. why do i have to only ever watch?
what will i do when the curtains close?
That was a different anon you replied to about your dirty places, but I'm exceptionally glad to see you go through with it. You're a very good girl. I'll have my writing to you shortly.
I would kiss and lick you in all of those places and more. And well done, I would indeed not have been satisfied with "genitalia"
if i ever saved a single person, i'd be happy.
i wonder if someone ever left.
Has anyone here ever fapped with someone else before?
a post so sarcastic even the coomposting replies seem ludicrous.
you should pick up writing anonette.
Gold star!
i never got one for my poetry..
are you only interested in these fleshly sensations?
Please answer these sexually charged questions!
What is your oldest fetish?
Anal, hardcore anal, large/deep anal penetration, cum filling the large intestine, just turning the anus into a cum repository (women, then later in life femboys kind of)
Newest fetish?
Nipple penetration
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
Definitely anal and bestiality with it
Feel free to add anything else you'd like to 
if I had a gf or femboy Id just want to constantly destroy their ass and make them drink/eat my cum as a food source, so less a partner more a cum bank?
pic related monster/demons 
but anal
Well, now I feel a bit jealous.
sometimes. i like masturbating with robots, they typically are repressed enough that it's fun to talk to them
Its not fun when they're not repressed?
i wish i could become something more poetic in life.
maybe a classical musician, an actor, or even a ballet dancer.
all of that while i'm on a much better path that'll have surplus time to do all of that if i wished.
i wonder why i feel this way.
I am a different anon(the friends mom sleeping with me naked as a kid), but seeing your attempts at being lewd are very cute and I am still aroused. Do you think you'd enjoy being licked all over?  I'd love to watch you squirm and squeak while I explore every corner of your body. Would you like that?
Nonetheless moth-chan I'm still rock hard its almost painful. I wish you were here to relieve me but watching you struggle to type out your degenerate desires will do for now.
they just release more of their deranged fantasies
are you telling me dude robots are so desperate for some interaction during sexual relief that they'll jack off with other dudes even if they're straight?
i'm not a guy but maybe for some they feel that way?
maybe i should just pick up an instrument.
there's a few pieces i'd rather listen than have sex, if it came down to it.
maybe i should stop with this somewhat pretentious talk.
No no, keep blogposting. We care.
Alright well what puts you in a situation where you're horny and willing enough to masturbate with some stranger over the internet? Its just odd to me, more often than not, especially here, its gonna be someone you're not attracted to in the slightest. Does that thought not pop into your mind while you schlick your bean for him over mic?
how nice.
ask something then. i'm feeling sensitive today.
its gonna be someone you're not attracted to in the slightest
i don't care because that wouldn't matter, we aren't gonna get married. i just care about what they're into
I think Misty from Pokemon woke me up first. 
Feet are hot OK!? They're cute and hot and... gosh darn it we could do better than human feet.
Do you like anal? Giving or receiving? Is that why you're sensitive today?
to be deeper on the art, do you ever feel that special 'something' it has?
it's some sort of ethereal beauty you can hear in music, or see in the movements of the dancers. and you can't really put a finger on it.
honestly even more things to that 'something'.
that elegance that goes along with it.
My mother used to say my sense of humor was 'uncharitable', I'm glad you find it amusing! I hope you also found it arousing..? I would feel much more shameful if I went through all that rigmarole only for my performance to fall flat...
I want to know when you boys coom to me, you know...
It's important...
Ahh, Mr. Poet Anon, you have company!
Oh my gracious, so I hadn't needed to do that to begin with?? 
If not that, what were you commanding me to do?
YOU CAN NOT!! SUDDENLY PRAISE ME!!! IN SUCH A MANNER!! I WILL D I E ! ! I WILL BE DEAD! YOU WILL BE A MURDERER AND HAVE KILLED ME! CRIPES!
You startled me so much I threw out my legs, (I have emotional spasms,) and I kicked my laptop off my bed into the wall...
I'm very very suing you for damages...
Hhhhhh...... you demon..
I have a talent for being incredibly earnest and at the same time very sarcastic, I've noticed. I think because part of me is a quarantined space where the naive schoolgirl lives, but she has to get along with the jaded and exhausted woman who gave up on society to masturbate and drink cheap wine, but they're both me, and when I get drunk, they are both get drunk with me, and I turn out like a particularly dually-natured creature of madness! Or something... I may have over-drank my tolerance to get through that embarrassment...
The gold stars are almost entirely arbitrary, I keep slipping in and out of this inside joke inside of my mind where I am a schoolteacher grading my students' homework submissions, but sometimes I forget the joke and don't mention it to begin with... and I don't think I ever told anyone the joke, anyways, so it's never even been funny...
Filling the large intestines! That's quite the volume Anon, better take those zinc supplements!
he thought anon was being serious
i actually feel a little bad
So, you see that a robot wants to jackoff with a woman and you just decide "I'm gonna help them get off"? You seem too nice to be telling the truth or you're just using them because their lust amuses you. Do you just sit there and fake moan etc? 
I'm bored and find this kind of interesting so forgive me if its boring to you
Ahh, Mr. Poet Anon, you have company!
ah, it's merely me again. although i would not feel too proud of writing free verse. that was just some pretty prose.
i am not the edging man also, i just did the post about finding your answer to him funny.
what do you think of my sense of beauty and of my poetry? i think i never asked for a deep answer to that.
You didn't need to write that, but I asked you to :(
Damn, so me not being that anon means I shouldn't have gotten that response? Well that's disheartening.
It's alright I get it, I don't add much and I'm just horny posting. But you are cute
oh, and as i forgot to add, i did not find it arousing.
it was a dry and very amusing answer that i reckoned was intending to shut down the coomposting.
you've taken a few layers of humor off by humoring it further with the other post.
Ahh, just because it isn't sincere doesn't mean it can't be fun. What are these threads for if not a bit of fun?
Luckily, I'll never have to face the choice!
How do you know? What if you meet a guy that just gets into your head. Pushes all your buttons because he reads you like a book. He exposes all you weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Things thst make you self conscious and insecure and he uses them against you. But he isn't mean about it. Not at first oh no. It's slow and subtle. Little steps to get you used to what he is doing to you. Getting more intense little by little. And then you wake up one day without friends, family or even a phone to call your own. Chained to a bed with a shock collar around your neck. And you know that it's right. That you deserve it.
Sorry! If you were referring to me, which I'm not entirely certain of, because a lot of sub conversations were occurring at this moment!
I feel it's natural to want more out of life and yourself, Anon. If it means enough to you, then you should chase that sort of personal change.
You say that like my attempts were not successful, oh jeez... now I'm triple-double guessing my performance here... I don't know! I have not been licked anywhere!
I don't know! I am too tense and loose! Sheesh! Maybe! I like feeling good, so, extrapolate that data, if you must...
I'm sorry if you're actually being hurt! Is there anything I can do to help within the limits of writing my ridiculous little posts?
Well that's quite the classic, Anon, I don't think many people could blame you for it!
I see, my apologies!
I'm a bit inebriated to create an intelligent response here... I think your poems are nice, but I don't really enjoy how you tend to shit all over the point of this thread, which I like to enjoy and have fun in.
Agh, no! You can't- I didn't mean it in such a way that you have taken it, stop that! I'm just confused now, were you asking for the other Anon's answer? I thought that you not being him meant you were asking for something else entirely!
Are you the Anon who hates burgers, whom I also assume is poem-anon? I think you largely misunderstood my intent here-
You people are stressing me out! All of you just quit it! I'm going on break.
You know when I made my gf call her vagina her pussy for the first time I came super hard. So girls being shy about talking about their assets is really hot to me. I love the little stutters and how they turn away from you. But the all like it. Their pussies are honest.
don't go!
i enjoy your annoyance at my antics. you could've been more subtle about me "shitting" the thread. something more poetic, perhaps.
you sound cuter each time up until the point you really get angry and give me an ultimatum.
would you write me a poem when you're sober?
Okay OP what are the chances we ever get to get drunk together and look at all the filth in these threads together? 4 hands rape faster than 2 so you wouldn't need to stay up so long. And we could play with each other while we look at what all these anons fantasize about.
It's all good! I misread your post to him as in you didn't need to write it out if it wasn't the licking anon asking. Lickings fine with me, still arousing, but my main thing is being forcefully rode. But knowing you and your...timid demeanor, I doubt you could fulfill such a desire if you were asked
But the thought of you mustering up the courage to do it for my sake? Let's just say it has me raring to go again 
because a lot of sub conversations were occurring at this moment
Oh, right. Seeing my wording and perversions regurgitated was distasteful is all, at least mine are spaced out. Something's off here and I can't pinpoint it. I think it's as my zoomie zoom younger brother would say, "The vibes are lowkey off bro", or the vague unsettling sensation of a crowd that just went quiet.
There are too many horny hooligans and I will not partake. Sayonara, moth-kun.
Anons have actually brought some interesting thoughts to this thread. OP really brings out some interesting discussion! Unfortunately, I don't think I have the patience to go in-depth into so many responses as OP has. I wish I did, there's a sort of appeal in answering so many responses. Maybe I enjoy the large amount of disconnected social interaction!
What the heck, I think I recognize you too.
If you are who I think you are, then I hope you've been doing better lately. We miss you a lot. How are things?
you type like you're fourty, take the poetry elsewhere. Everyone here is for horny posting. Its a thread about fetishes for fucks sake lol
i'm the only guy who writes poetry here.
is this other guy doing some subpar attempt at it too?
Ok so I did my creative writing that you suggested and I'd like to post it but it's a bit long...very long, in fact. So, err, here. LINK I tried to use PasteBin but I guess that doesn't allow objectionable content so I found this alternative, and then 4chan thought the link was spam so I had to split it and I'm getting flustered so I guess it's an image I did in Paint now.
I'd be interested what other anons have to say though I'd prefer if you were nice, or at least constructive. This was my first attempt at something like this, and it's kinda hard to put myself out there, even if it's anonymous. Please be kind
I want to read visual novels with a girl. I did that once and it was quite enjoyable. ||Anyone here wanna do it with me?||
and she would indeed, take it all
acutely horny brain
besides some weirdness like that, just a few bad stylistic choices at points.
not bad.
I can relate! I'm too shy to talk about sexual stuff with girls, and I feel like that's held me back a few times. It's nice that OP gave us a place to vent about these things.
yeah.
but i'm a guy and want to read the classics.
we're gonna lull ourselves to sleep reading proust.
You startled me so much I threw out my legs, (I have emotional spasms,) and I kicked my laptop off my bed into the wall...
This is adorable! Don't hurt your laptop too much!
You Anons have had me on the ropes for twenty four hours now... that's a lot of time to do nothing but write posts. I don't mean to be a jokester when I say that I'm delicate, this kind of thing really is like running a marathon for me... I get all tuckered out. If you're making posts to me as a person, which I'm always iffy about (even if it excites me), please try to keep in mind that I can only take so much ribbing and social intensity before I will stop working. I am trying my best, but I am not very smart and I am not very confident, and every time one of you speaks to me as a person and not just a thread organizer I feel like I am going to throw up.
I am sorry for combusting. I'll go back to posting now.
Don't stress yourself out. If it makes you genuinely uncomfortable and bothers you, I'll stop the prodding questions. 
This is supposed to be enjoyable but for some of us its only enjoyed if reciprocated by you, engaging back and forth and getting your (personal) angle.
Break for as long as ya need and if some things are too personal for you  just say so
I will admit that second bit you listed was my least favourite part, and one of the last I wrote just to finish it off. If by stylistic parts you mean the layout and the double spacing between even dialogue, it was mostly because I write in Notepad like a luddite and it's harder to go back and change things if it isn't evenly split. 
The not bad alone was actually quite nice, thanks, anon.
I'm genuinely sorry if I took things too far earlier, I was just trying to have a bit of fun, but not at your expense. You're very cool in your threads, and replying to so many people is clearly really hard. Well done, you're appreciated...as a thread organiser.
I am not very smart
This seems untrue, though. Solid thread organisers shouldn't be so tough on themselves.
I spent half an hour making my way through this thread and now you want me to read your fanfiction??
...guess I will!
...maybe I should spend my time on something more productive today.
I wanted to read a visual novel, not a book... and with a girl... I guess the general idea of reading something with someone is still kind of interesting though.
I think this is one of your most popular threads by far! 409 replies at the time of writing. I think we will hit the bump limit (500) this time! 
If you're making posts to me as a person, which I'm always iffy about (even if it excites me), please try to keep in mind that I can only take so much ribbing and social intensity before I will stop working.
Sorry, but it's kind of hard to ignore the human behind the posts. I really do like how interesting your replies are, and I admire how you put in so much effort to respond to every anon. I always have an image of you in my head responding cutely and acting flustered at the raunchier responses. I wonder what your voice sounds like? Do you read some posts aloud? Do you talk to yourself as you type? 
...sorry, I asked more questions about you! Feel free to not respond.
*pat pat* I hope you are not too burnt out today!
and with a girl.
i can dress up like one if you want
Her bra is the picnic-blanket pattern, ahaha...
I will never meet a guy again, Anon. All of my finances and resources go towards staying as hikki as possible. As emotionally pungent as your little bad-ending story is, (I can't deny it tore up the emotions-part-of-my-belly), I've already embraced isolation and torture at the hands of my own mind. There's no room for two domineering sadists, and my internal projection of God's wrath combined with my own sinful urges are already doing a bang-up job. I wouldn't be surprised if five years down the line I might using shock collars on myself to simulate the very thing you're talking about, still high on an absurd level of denial about how I'm not yet too far gone.
I turned away from my computer while typing that, as if it would somehow lessen my involvement with it... ahaha... I'm a rather ridiculous person, sometimes.
You could have been more subtle when you talked badly about the only thing I know how to do that makes me feel happy and told me you didn't like my post even though I worked very hard on it and then told me I was funny only to say I wasn't funny at all.
Don't expect me to be subtle. I'm a drunk, Anon. My eyes are blurry and my nose is runny and I'm drinking four dollar wine and I actually didn't even do my job today because of this thread, and you were mean.
If this is not a good post it's because you kept the thread up for so long! Let it die after midnight next time!
You would have to somehow sleuth out my town and manage to find me during my once-per-month outing to an undisclosed location, find me at mass during major catholic holidays, or intercept me at my brother's house.
Insert yourself into my little life bubble and I haven't a clue what may happen. Which is precisely why I avoid that happening, at all costs.
The nipple-sucking... sheesh... how does it appeal to you?
Firstly, I like boobs (just like many people), so I suppose it's natural for me to want to interact with them in a multitude of ways: caressing, licking, kissing, sucking, rubbing my dick on them, and even plain staring at them. Another theory is that it's just an instinctual urge to want to suck them, a piece of brain programming that has stuck around even though I do not need to breastfeed anymore. And lastly, it would bring me great pleasure to see a woman squirming in pleasure from me sucking her nipples. A win-win for all parties involved. Do you like the idea of having your nipples sucked, anon?
Ahh, okay, anon! Will keep secret.
No wonder why you're posting these threads. It must be a way to vent off those years of pent-up sexual frustration!
aw, sorry. i didn't mean to be rude.
most of it was in jest.
i did find it funny.
What is your oldest fetish?
Pee (getting peed on), probably
Newest fetish?
Findom, sadly
Most prevalent and significant fetish?
Femdom in general.
You know, not to shit on you but more of us all in general...we can be quite horrible here, and it's often easy to forget there's another person reading your response. Maybe it takes someone sufficiently eloquent (like OP) for us to realise that. We should all be nicer to each other...
my internal projection of God's wrath combined with my own sinful urges are already doing a bang-up job
how does that work out/how do you reason it up?
i think the bigger problem is your coping mechanisms got overwhelmed and then you just rode along. was it something along the lines of running from urges and desires, or just kind of containing them?
seems like me being a wretched sinner for so long actually helped current me in some way. i know how bad it is to be in that spot, and can understand what drives one to be there.
i wonder how it'd feel to not have caved in at all.
yeah, i often see that, and try to be as kind as possible.
let the cynical textual critic side take over for a moment
I came into this thread horny but now I'm just overwhelmed with the desire to help you in some way.
Op I really think you should head to bed. Drink some water and get some rest, you'll feel much better in the morning. Please don't skip out on your job just to chat with robots on here. We enjoy your posts a lot but it kinda hurts seeing your tone change so suddenly. 
I wish there was some way to keep up with you, even just as someone to converse with when you need it. I said it before but you seem like an interesting person and as someone who's life has spiraled out of control, I don't want to see the same for others and don't want you giving up. 
Please try to cheer up op!
I'm quite sorry Anon, I can barely keep track of the post chains anymore. Something happened, I made a post, three people were mad and someone was claiming I was funny, which I wanted to hear even though honestly I hadn't even known I'd made a joke unless my halfhearted attempts at pretending to be above the post was a joke, and then it all exploded. Whatever I said to you, I apologize, I'm glad you're not upset anymore.
You pose a very good question though, in a hypothetical war between my church-mouse-esque temperament and my eagerness to please, which would win out? I haven't the foggiest notion... I feel it would rely heavily upon the context, but there are certainly circumstances in which I extend beyond my comfort zone for the sake of making someone happy. Heck, I just did that. I have never called my genitalia vulgar terms before, as far as I'm aware, though I can't particularly say my memory is sharp, or that my tongue isn't loose.
I can't manage to understand what things you're referring to, things I've said or done. I don't quite know which Anon you are, either. This is all greatly confusing.
Goodnight, Anon. I'm sorry if this thread has stressed you excessively, like it has myself.
I read the full story, slowly, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. You're quite the creative, so you should be very proud of yourself! It's definitely erotic, (I quite especially was excited by the idea of a 'ribbon' that seemed to be a secret sign between them to go buck wild, what a concept!) and it was rather arousing, I found myself falling into that old trap that comes along with any lovely romantic smut, yearning and disappointment. It's why some measure of unkindness or emotional disengagement is important to my erotic media of choice, and why getting too personal in these threads only serves to make me gloomy.
Thank you for putting in so much wonderful effort at my behest, though! You should be very happy with the results!
Ah darn, I missed most of this thread. I like seeing you around OP, keep up the threads.
But you CAN be personal. You CAN be with someone still. There are plenty of people out there who just want someone they can talk to and who would be there. You were hurt and broken and I'm sorry to hear that, but you aren't a lost cause and your life isn't set in stone! You can experience all of these things!
my discord is kell#5037 if you change your mind. You deserve love, you deserve to be happy in your life.
Thank you for your words about my story, and I know the pain. I'm essentially writing about something I deeply want, but will likely never have. As you say, emotional disengagement is useful, even though sometimes I find myself falling into the romantic yearning. I'm glad you sort of pushed me into doing it, though, because it was quite fun.
I'm also the anon who made you say vulgar terms about dirty places. I apologised above for taking it too far, but I feel I need to again. When I think about my domination fantasies, it's often about pushing my imaginary partner to her limits, but never past them, and while we obviously do not have that relationship, I still feel like I failed in a similar sort of regard here. Perhaps had I read closer or thought harder, I would've realised you were uncomfortable and stopped. From the bottom of my heart, anon, I am sorry.
i REALLY care! please give me a crumb of coochie!
The mental image matters more to me than anything, I suppose. And how does your voice sound?
I agree with this anon!
believe what ya want, I'm just another sad loser who doesn't wanna see other people posting about being sad, so because I can't fix my own life situation I desperately want to help others.
yeah, the same old routine.
we both know the act will fall and you'll get sexual within a day at best.
half-manly. i could try to make it sound more pleasant for you.
I relate to you! One of my fantasies is meeting a fembot from here and encouraging her to improve herself one step at a time, which is quite ironic considering how unwilling I am to change my life. Honestly, I think I would be able to change if I had someone encouraging me in return.
Wait, you're actually serious about wanting to read something together?
yeah. head on your chest and all.
fuck, the image of being in female clothes and in that position actually made me aroused.
and i call myself straight.
Oldest: Being bullied by women.
Newest: Pole dancing, but it's not even that new, I got pretty set in my fetishes by my early twenties. Maybe the smell of women too?
Most prevalent: Older women who are tired and just want some lovin' and a man to boss around.
I remember being really into women in skin tight outfits really young. I don't think it was sexual, but looking back it's kinda strange that as a 3rd grader I was thinking of girls dressed up in skintight leather suits beating me up. And this was before Charlie's Angels was a thing too, I checked.
It was quite fun for a time! Not the worst thread, at the very least, just far too long-lasting.
That was definitely part of my aim!
I thought it had broken! I'm very glad it did not!
I have never been one to make big scary rules about 'do or don't this', but it would be nice if you would consider the effects it may have... if we have spoken enough for you to look forward to it, or target a particular topic I may be weak to, it would be nice if you gave me space to recover in between bouts of intensity!
I will admit that it is partly my fault for not setting boundaries, but outside of this thread, it's really not a skill I'll need, so don't expect me to get any better... especially when I drink...
I don't know who did what anymore, Anon, I just want to shove the whole mess out of my mind.
Thank you for the compliment, I will take it.... just don't tell anyone...
I can assure you that I am constantly flustered while writing these posts! You people are flustering! I don't mean to say you should ignore me, just that if you must really see me as a person, I would appreciate if you would be a little gentle with me sometimes.
I suppose I can't argue with the faultless logic of 'cuz I like it', ahaha...
Would I enjoy the experience? I'm not certain, it's a difficult sensation to imagine. I am curious how their shape might effect tongue-interpolation, owing to (as I have mentioned prior) their natural inversion. They are fairly sensitive so I imagine it would feel exciting!
I wish I were more able to discern, but inconveniently, I will never be able to tell if someone is fooling around of if someone is truly upset with me, and it's not something I seem to digest very easily in the latter case.
Oh, dear. Have you lost much money to the fetish? It seems very unfortunate...
Boundary! I'm not doing evangelization tonight! Shush!
I'm not doing evangelization tonight! Shush!
eh. next time.
good night anonette! sweet dreams.
Image reply limit has been reached. Oh, how will we know who OP is from now on??? Perhaps it is a sign for her to abandon the thread? Or perhaps she will stay with us even through this dilemma?
I'm not actually too opposed to the idea, to be honest. Rate yourself, are you cute?
I think your extremely detailed replies are one reason why these threads tend to last so long! Another reason is your devoted eagerness to reply to each and every response. I love your enthusiasm! Gold star!
I forget if this has been asked before, but would you consider yourself a hypersexual?
i'd say so.
i'm very lithe, but i got some pretty thick legs.
quite skinny, but pulling more to the fit side.
have had my ass grabbed once.
I think your extremely detailed replies are one reason why these threads tend to last so long! Another reason is your devoted eagerness to reply to each and every response. I love your enthusiasm! Gold star!
Was going to comment on that. An applause for OP, a real one. They don't make 'em like that anymore.
Thirded. Gold star, indeed!
W-well, anon... Discord?
I am not nearly as cute as you are, however.
I believe she is well deserving of my title for her as the "Best Poster of 2023"! (This is not meant to stress you out or put any expectations on you, however, OP!)
[Picture of a white haired elf with bangs and red eyes slumped over a very loosely sketched bar, looking exhausted, holding a capri-sun in one hand as if it's an alcoholic beverage. She's wearing a headband with ribbons shaped like bunny ears along with the classic bunny suit uniform, seeming like she is an overworked waitress or service lady taking a much needed break.]
I try my best, but when Anons keep me posting this long, I need a big break to recover!
I'm very sorry for spoiling your arousal! That's the very last thing I want for these threads! Please try not to worry too much, I'll be fine, no matter what happens. Please don't despair for my sake. I'm fully grown, I'm responsible for my actions, one and all.
Yes, Anon, but I won't; I made a decision. I'm not some child saying 'it's over' before it began; I give up. That's all.
Thank you again for writing it, and I'm very glad you enjoyed it!
As for the dirty words, that was actually not what upset me, so please don't fret about that; it just made me very, very stirred up, and somewhat emotionally primed me to be receptive, meaning that after that post (when things became confusing for several different reasons, and there was an unexpectedly high level of negativity, and a discouragement of the erotic behavior) it was too much for me to handle whatosever. 
I enjoyed being teased and talking in an embarrassing way. I enjoy playing little games as we talk about fetishes, I enjoy these things when I don't feel pressured into something real or when people are being unkind. It's just... dangerous, I suppose. You made me hyper-sensitive, emotionally, and as a result, the slight negativity or disappointment or what have you utterly floored me.
nah, i'm just kinda egging you on.
not unlike op's posting.
none of this dude in a skirt for you, VNanon
If it's over because of the image limit and all, then have a good break. Came back after helping with stuff, and this was a very good thread.
I enjoy these things when I don't feel pressured into something real or when people are being unkind. It's just... dangerous, I suppose.
Such interactions are best facilitated with someone you trust! Trust is definitely a big part of having such intimate reactions with people, especially with how vulnurable you seem to be, OP.
...I still need to read anon's fanfiction and give him a review. Sorry.
FUCK YOU ;-; I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING
hey, don't talk to me like that.
i'll be here next thread, we can keep enjoying the idea.
it's actually because i don't have discord.
is there any way i can make it up to you?
As for the dirty words, that was actually not what upset me, so please don't fret about that
I'm glad, I've actually been quite upset for a while that I might've cause someone to feel as bad as you seemed to. I don't really understand what happened after nor do I care to find out, just putting it behind me. 
You seem really sweet, and I'll be keeping an eye out for your threads in the future. Though perhaps you should take a few days to relax. I'd like to say, however, that you calling yourself "not smart" is so patently, obviously absurd. [Picture of a dog getting whacked with a rolled up newspaper.] No. Bad anon. No.
I'm not sure if I'll be here next thread, but if you see me say hi! And you don't have to make anything up to me, I was just playfully saying that. Tone doesn't translate very well through text, I suppose. It sounded a lot different in my head. I apologize.
I can't help but worry about you, it's no fault but my own. I hope you have a great sleep op, this thread was amazing. Please don't overdo them, for your own mental sake. Feel free to still add me if you ever just want to chat &lt;3
i won't let it slide!
you'll need to do something really nice to me when i'm all cuddled up on your chest to make up for it.
please have me do something! i can't stand letting you down
Hey poster currently known as Moth did you have anything to do with the sudden emergence and just as sudden disappearance of the femanon known as Vanilla-chan 
My friend was really head over heels for her and since you are both such classy and unique ladies I thought you might run in the same circles and have some sort of 
lead
Have you lost much money to the fetish?
Probably a little less than 1k, I've never felt post-nut clarity as strongly as after a drain session.
[Picture of a woman with pale blonde hair wearing a maid uniform and cat ears; words above her head declare her the new neko maid; she is very uncertain about this, a bead of sweat forming on her brow in apprehension, and she's weakly protesting.]
Ahaha, the image of your type being a sexually frustrated, middle aged woman who works at a diner and pulls you into the bathroom for some stress relief and intimacy and coffee-scented cowgirl milf-lovin.
P.S. I would never say anything Sex, ever. 
I will post until I am freed by Archival or my bedtime calls me on a biological level, Anon.
You say my replies cause the threads to last, but it stayed well alive during my hibernation through the night, never posting once! Though I suppose we could blame that on the masochistic lady who came through...
Yay! A gold star!
I couldn't say, doctors terrify me. I know my libido has been at the very least inconvenient since I was very young, so quite possibly, but I would never claim it myself.
Thank you! I try my very very hardest for everyone! I want to make sure everyone feels like I truly actually care for what they say, and give them a reason to trust me with their feelings and wants and weird mucky interests.
I will not place my trust in a single living soul and I never will, Anon!
I'm happy you stayed up to read my clarification, I would have hated for you to feel guilt over something that was all well and good! It was rather intense, but nothing I would loathe or regret. It was scary in a fun way, instead of dreadful in a bad way, like the other nonsense. I'm just glad it's over at this point.
I don't mean to talk badly about myself, but it's simply a fact of myself. It doesn't take intelligence to have a wide vocabulary or singleminded dedication, you know.
[Mio in tracksuit, holding taiyaki, looking down at viewer]
I'd like to say, however, that you calling yourself "not smart" is so patently, obviously absurd.
I agree; it broke my heart a little to hear OP say that, especially when she's taking the time to provide such well-written content for anons to enjoy. I'd say OP's a lot more intelligent than many of us, just based on the way she writes.
OP, you are wonderful and intelligent and I love talking to you! I understand you may feel bad about yourself sometimes, but many of us anons here feel otherwise!
W-well, I guess it's my turn to be flustered, huh, and by another guy. This is quite the turn of events. 
I'm quite fine with just cuddling... maybe running my fingers through your soft hair. Not much more I could ask for. (I feel this post is quite incriminating for me).
Don't make me get the damn newspaper again! Next it'll be the hose!
I'm going to bed now, think my electric blanket has warmed up enough by now so it'll be nice and cosy. Thank you for the great thread, and for pushing me to do something I wouldn't have otherwise. Have another gold star.
I would say you demonstrate significant reasoning time and time again, and that is certainly a sign of intelligence.
Please try not to do so! If I feel that people will worry for me, it causes me to worry and fret about it myself!
I wish that I could help with this missing person's case, but as it happens, I run in zero circles and know zero people, so I haven't the faintest clue about who or where that lady may be; I'm sorry I'm not able to help!
Jeez louise, I'm sorry Anon! I hope you find a way to lose interest!
I am curious, though, would you be aroused if you were to be playing Monopoly with a woman, and she were to cheat at the game subtly, forcing you to pay exuberant fees in the game? The image of that is quite silly to me but also quite interesting!
Anon, this isn't some elaborate attempt to badtalk myself... I'm really just not terribly clever, I just memorize big words. I appreciate your rejection of the idea, but unfortunately, I've been rather slow-minded since birth.
hey, where's the part i have to do?
i think that'd be pretty nice too. i could grow it out if you want.
i'm getting all tingly in the right places.
what would you rather i smelled like?
i was thinking something grape or strawberry scented. would you like that?
flustered
knew i could get under your skin. still don't think i'll get better at it than moth-anon though..
 the image of your type being a sexually frustrated, middle aged woman who works at a diner and pulls you into the bathroom for some stress relief and intimacy and coffee-scented cowgirl milf-lovin.
Huh, coffee does smell good. I actually really like women that smell like smokes and cheap perfume, only times I ever got lewd, that was their scent.
it goes to bed or it gets the hose!
[Mio sitting in tree shade, holding onigiri, mecha hoe and hat behind her]
I can't believe I spent my whole day responding to posts and reading this thread. Your posts (and you, OP) are very alluring.
I'm rather proud I was able to create such a complimentary image to your tastes, down to the minor details!
Ah, remember kids, CoomPosting is a gateway drug!
would you be aroused if you were to be playing Monopoly with a woman, and she were to cheat at the game subtly, forcing you to pay exuberant fees in the game?
Probably yes, but I wouldn't consider that findom. That would arouse me because the idea of girls taking advantage of me turns me on, and I'm into femdom in general. I also forgot to mention I'm into SPH.
[Mio with mecha tail, floating sword and fin funnels]
OHH VANILLA-CHAN I was just thinking about her the other day! She hasn't responded to me on Discord. Maybe I'll try messaging her again. I do wonder where she went. 
Give me... a kiss on the cheek, then...
i was thinking something grape or strawberry scented. would you like that?
Well, we'd have to try out a bunch of different things to see what I prefer.
flustered
I am quite easily flustered if people push the right buttons!
I'm really just not terribly clever, I just memorize big words.
I would not reduce your writing to just a matter of "big words," anon! You have an inherent charm.
I've been rather slow-minded since birth.
Me too, honestly... sucks to be a late bloomer. I am very far behind my peers in terms of academics. And socializing, for that matter. And a lot of different things, too...

aw, just that? you've easily appeased.
okay! i want to smell the best for you.
if people push the right buttons
guess i'm a really good button pusher, huh?
Perhaps you are!
I do not have nearly the endurance of OP for imagining these scenarios, so... I apologize! I cannot carry on this scenario any further ( />~&lt;)/
And I thought OP got flustered rather easily when here I am getting burned out after just a few replies. I have a newfound appreciation for her.
what other buttons do you have?
just found you answer to op's questions...
i usually play with my nipples; would you be open to indulging in it with me?
it's one of the places all this posting makes me feel tingly in..

what's got into you anon?
It... happens sometimes okay ;-;
it's alright. feels really good to know i've got you all riled up for me!
any other accessories you find nice? i'm taking quite a liking to chokers..
maybe even something more revealing as main clothing?
am i pushing you too hard? or are you enjoying it?

Umm... maybe...? Sure, anon...
careful... they have a tendency to lead to more stuff...
i'm sure you can resist that though, right?
I'm tapping out. Sorry anon ( ,>_&lt;,)
To be honest, I'm not sure I can stay here for long, my mind is occupied by work
I'm thinking about a caim hot spring, where i just dose off as the calm splashing water allows me to let my guard down. Thinking how good would it feel just for someone to take me away.
no tapping out in this fight! 
i'm gonna force finish you to win!
water, huh.
still with swimsuits, right?
it might get weird if it's the other kind...
okay, last thing then.
i'm gonna do something naughty, what should a boy like me do with it after i finish?
I don't mind either way. We're both creating this tiny world. 
I want to ask you something: what are you thinking about?
hwo nice it'd feel in that warm spring. we should be careful not to overheat.
i guess you could just hold me in your lap as if i weighed nothing because of the water, too..
Of course you can. You can dose off on my shoulder or my chest, I wouldn't mind that at all. I actually would like that. 
Just being comfy and sleepy together.
Anon, I told you, I can't answer these!!! Sorry...
I just liked sonic girls because they were nice
lick it but only after getting it on your feet
do you think i'd look nice in those really small two piece swimsuits?
yeah, i guess it'd feel nice. would leave us all relaxed. and i would feel really great and safe being on your chest..
i'm shaking really hard now.. guess i got flustered too.
i need something that doesn't make too much of a mess...
I think you would look great in anything, desu. 
Let your fears go, whatever goes your way, I'll be there for you. Sleepy, but there nontheless
hey, don't be so passive.
i'm already on your chest, do something daring!
This thread has somehow gotten incredibly gay without OP here...
I bite and nibble on your ear, you little brat! >:)
I am passive like this haha. 
It seems like you want something, then you have to show me what you want. I am content with your little head on my chest as is -3-
you evil man! guess i'll need to let my hand slip further down..
btw, what do you say? >>73120458
Be careful your hand is in dangerous waters now... Unless that's the way you want it... Maybe you need someone to pin you against the wall of the bath and teach you some manners?
yes please! i'm really in need of a correction.
Nothing!!!
I guess this thread's heading down to page 10 now, huh. Nice chatting with OP and anons today.
How about I take you somewhere private, and teach you some manners? Just make you lay your stomach on my lap, and spank you? Or maybe you would like for someone to see you being disciplined that way?

Origins 
When I was 12 my neighbor who was a gothic edgy girl who I think was 16 would constantly touch me and ask me out. One day I embarrassed her because the fire department got me a bike and a bunch of cool toys and it was the only thing I cared about. She then got fucking pissed at me and everyday would spit on me. One day I was walking back home cutting through my friends area of apartments and her friends lured me over to the laundry mat. 
I went inside and she immediately grabbed the back of my neck and arm pinning me to the ground. She turned me over and started punching me in the face and I just couldnt fight back at all. I eventually submitted and let her molest me. Her friends at that point tried to stop her before getting scared and running off while the other one just stared at me. Ever since then I was attracted to girls who dressed like her and took control. I hate her but I want her to do it to me again and again. I was also touched 2 times before that but those are very vague memories even my mom refuses to talk about. Probably because she feels like she let me down and failed her kid in a way. I dont blame her or my attackers though

Coming from a dude who dropped out of seminary it's all made up. A bunch of drunk monks got tired of making beer and wine all day and requested a detail to canonize the christian bible. They selected works that were period correct, in line with current doctrine, and poetic. Historical validity and concrete evidence were not considered. These were simply clergymen looking for a new job.
Now, christianity is an industry. That man, and most other ministers are simply grifters and salesmen. Most of those who continue on to be ministers are either faking it completely, or their fanaticism is so strong that they do genuinely believe. The more you educate yourself on religion and the beliefs that you were likely indoctrinated into, the harder they become to believe.

Who's to say that you losing your faith was also through indoctrination? Who are you to speak for ministers who preach for the betterment of their communities and to those who simply want to bring peace to people who need it most?

I assure you, almost every single minister, pastor, priest, etc. is faking it. It's a big charade because it's a lifestyle that almost all of them were indoctrinated into. It's extremely difficult to turn away from the system you were given at birth. It has been extremely difficult for me. While many churches and other religious communities do good things those ministers are ultimately just at a job that requires a bit of an act. It would be better if we could do the things and develop the communities religions build without the religion part, but that is nearly impossible.
I actually attempted suicide after spending a semester trying to study something that I don't believe at all. I tried everything I could to hold myself together but the lie and moral implications were too much for me to bear. I survived and chose to never return.

You must not have studied very hard, or whatever school you went to was garbage, because nothing in your posts correlates to reality. I hope you got a refund.

The Church you're thinking of are megachurches designed by greedy people. The average church is simply a community coming together. 
Do you discredit the actions of others just because it's their job to do what they do and that they were "indoctrinated" into doing these things, even if they're positive? You yourself couldnt handle it, so you left, but if others can and then go on to do good, will you also discredit their actions, knowing that they wanted to do these good actions despite being "indoctrinated" (choosing to do it)?

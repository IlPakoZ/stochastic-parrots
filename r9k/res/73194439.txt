6:30am not slept
Guess I'll just stay up too damn awake
same. i love not sleeping though because it kills my anxiety
yeah you might lose some of the edge, on the flipside you start thinking about life and become suicidal on too little sleep too, start ruminating about life, also I feel like complete shit on not sleeping and can't do it the older I get too, mood just takes a nosedive and I wanna kms over that too
but we shall see
I went to bed at 6:30 today, and woke up around 12:30, it's doable.
when I have something to do I can sleep 2-3hours and wake up without an alarm and go out the door
if i dont, then i snooze all my alarms and dont wake up even if "intend to"
doable sure, but do i wanna, kinda late too

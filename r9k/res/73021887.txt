How? Just...HOW???
Dude most people go there to actually study
Wasn't difficult. I hate women.
And most of them still manage to get laid.
Maybe if you go to MIT and everyone is autistic. Most colleges are just delaying adulthood; doing the bare minimum academics because the classes are piss easy and spending your excess free time getting drunk/high and trying to fuck.
Dude most people study 6 to 8 hours a day wtf you are saying?
How? Just...HOW???
Because I wasn't a rich kid who got to move away for school and live on campus or student housing, I still lived with my parents while taking the bus to community college, and then a longer bus ride to state university. I once got a girl in my chem class to make out with me, but we both lived with our parents, far from each other, and don't drive, so that was that.
I'm a retarted

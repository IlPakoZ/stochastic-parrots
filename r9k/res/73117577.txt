I don't feel anything from jerking off anymore.
Same. Haven't been able to keep my dick hard with my fwb the past few times she came over. Depression I suppose. Think I'm going to start drinking again for a week or two.
I don't even jerk off anymore lol
I have also lost most of what I felt in years past, but that doesn't stop me from waking up in the middle of the night on occasion in an incredibly horny stupor. At least every few months, I will wake up anywhere from 1-4am stupidly horny, and in a dazed state of sleepiness and horniness, I will commit the most depraved things I am capable of. It's almost like a trance, idk why it happens, but I can never control it. By the time I open my eyes, I'm already raging.
Just last night, around 2am I woke up dick in hand and proceeded to edge for 20 minutes by fucking my bed.
hahaha saaame
poopoocaca indeed so it seems so it seems

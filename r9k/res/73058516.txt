How did you end up talking to her OP?

I was playing MaiMai Festival but there were a lot of people queueing up so most people tend to pair up to play because they get to play more songs that way.
She asked if anyone want to play with her and later I joined her. She speaks in English and my English is ok so we got along pretty well.
I'm heading to the airport currently. Prob not going to even see her face for a long time or never again.

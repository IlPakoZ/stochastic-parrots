i'll never meet anyone so perfect ever again
i would have done anything for him
but i pushed myself away because i'm a feeder and he deserves better
<comment>
a feeder in the fetish sense?
<comment>
yes i like fat men and it turns me on when they overeat
not as fat as you might think hearing that like 200lbs is usually more than fat enough
<comment>
ah... i see
fetishes are so damn bad sometimes, it feels so limiting, i have one on my own that i probably wont get to satisfy
200 lbs is not that much, but i suppose you are talking about a 5'9 person or something?
<comment>
thats disgusting you creep. he was right to ditch you and you deserve to die alone
<comment>
What did you like about him? How did you meet?

i pushed myself away
Kek. Did you give him the "You're too good for me" talk? Or did you slowly withdraw all affection and leave
Either way, girls like you are always one low self-esteem pendulum swing from ghosting. Truly heartless in tunnel-visioned low self-esteem, the feeding fetish being an arbitrary rationalization, with other variants being you're now 'asexual' or just 'not being ready for a relationship yet' (not unheard of to also download tinder then) and then leaving despite his wishes for you to stay.

it depends on height i deleted all my pictures of fat men so i can't post any but yes not obscenely fat
i slowly withdrew then gave him a big spaghetti confession out of nowhere
i like everything about him
his voice, his hobbies, his comedy, his personality
he's cold and abrasive but really it's just a defence mechanism and he's a sweetheart deep down
i love him so much
i'd do anything for him
<comment>
baby i love everything about you
you're perfect
but i need you to alter your physical appearance in a way that's unhealthy to find you physically attractive
fuck you kys
<comment>
If you are a cute girl you can feed me but you have to do it in sexy clothes or dressed up as my favorite anime girl
That's the law
<comment>
But where did you meet?
his voice, his hobbies, his comedy, his personality
he's cold and abrasive but really it's just a defence mechanism and he's a sweetheart deep down
Yiu mean he's tall and has a good jawline.

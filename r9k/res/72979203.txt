Tha one millenial/zoomer who still phone calls in 2023
You don't do this, do you? My sister can't go through her work week without disscuging the smallest of issues with a friend or a co-worker, and while he longer calls tend to last about an hour it's still somewhat weird, especially if you're the kind of person who never sends long text messages out of pure laziness.
We are not teenagers anymore.

I missed out on an $80k a year job opportunity because I use my phone that little and didn't realize I was being scheduled for an interview.

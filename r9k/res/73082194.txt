Why do women have their own seperate chess tournaments?

Whenever a woman beats a man in a chess match the man literally Goes into rage or depression.
it's to protect some men's ego
t. a man

there have been studies done on how women perform better when they don't know their opponent's gender. but if they know it's a man, they do worse than against anonymous (but still male) opponents.
but yeah, this leads me to think that it's just stigma.

95% of chess players are male, so to make it a little more fair there is women only sections, but they can participate in general tournaments as well.

It's called paraolympics.

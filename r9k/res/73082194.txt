Why do women have their own seperate chess tournaments?
Whenever a woman beats a man in a chess match the man literally Goes into rage or depression.
it's to protect some men's ego
t. a man
there have been studies done on how women perform better when they don't know their opponent's gender. but if they know it's a man, they do worse than against anonymous (but still male) opponents.
but yeah, this leads me to think that it's just stigma.
95% of chess players are male, so to make it a little more fair there is women only sections, but they can participate in general tournaments as well.
should there be an only black tournament then?
It's called paraolympics.
thats interesting i wonder if its because men play better if they know theyre playing a woman or women play worse when they know its a man or a mix between
because women are dumber.
Look at the geniuses, inventors, etc.
98% men.
and mostly white men too.
Brownoids barely produce anything of value. Just a bunch of retarded lesser evolved inferior subhuman undesirable shitskin filth.
it's confidence. Confidence is huge in chess
easy to advertise

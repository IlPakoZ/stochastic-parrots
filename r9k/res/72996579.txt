sent dick pics to a guy from /soc/ 10 years older than me because I liked the attention
There's no coming back from this, is there? The post-nut regret is killing me. What do I do?

Deberias considerar el suicidio

Estoy pensando sobre suicidio, pero no es diferente que el normal.

Now do something even worse so that this event will seem like nothing in the shadow of this new and significantly worse thing.

How old is he?
Don't do that

He was in his mid to late 20s. I'm in my late teens (over 18, don't worry janny).

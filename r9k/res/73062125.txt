On this day we celebrate Saint George, England and the English language. 
So I offer a warm greeting to all my fellow English-speaking brethren, and indeed, to our urheimat of England itself.
English is basically a mix of old german, celtic and latin.
And the saxons were a german tribe.
And the ruling house of Windsor was named Saxe-Coburg-Gotha before WW1, and is of german descent.
Brits are basically germans. Admit it.
English is basically a mix of old german, celtic and latin.
No it isn't. There's barely any Celtic influence on English. There is a lot of Latin influence on it, but that's the same for all Germanic languages, especially West Germanic languages. 
In many cases German has Latin influence in areas which English has retained Germanic words. 
Such as window. 
And the saxons were a german tribe.
Your point?
And the ruling house of Windsor was named Saxe-Coburg-Gotha before WW1, and is of german descent.
Your point?
They're Germanic, yes, not Germans. Germanic peoples have diversified since the Proto-Germanic era. 
Also it's English, not Brits. British refers to speakers of Brittonic languages, which are Celtic (albeit of a shared Indo-European origin and descent to Germanic languages).
Ok, was kind of bait to see if there are some educated people here.

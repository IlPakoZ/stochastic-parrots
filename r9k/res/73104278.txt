why don't you just start a general goods store with a paltry $335,000 "loan" from your father-in-law or uncle?
I am a Walmart employee and just enrolled in their 401k. They match up to 6% of your contributions. The corporate people are obsessed with Sam Walton and treat him like a god.
damn they match up to $6 per paycheck thats wild straight bussin
Anon Walmart pays pretty well I make $23 an hour rn
what's your position at the wal mart?
Order selector (warehouse). I am due for another raise soon and am probably getting promoted to one of their new trainer positions which I assume entails a raise because I'll have to interview for it and attend a class, and it's just a lot of extra responsibility. For years they didn't pay the trainers anything extra and that was really fucked up because warehouses are dangerous and it takes a lot to train someone new to safely work and perform their job in that kind of environment.
oh, so you're 1 in 1000 employees in terms of pay. k
saved $83,850 from his time in the army
What sort of store? 335k is basically nothing these days you would waste that just getting the fridges up and running.
that was in 1945, you could buy an oil rig for $15 and a car for $3
Tens of millions of Americans have more than $400k in home equity. I could borrow almost $200k from my own 401k.
NEETs who deliberately live on public assistance and collect cans to try to buy a new laptop have a skewed conception of the ability of middle class people to accumulate minor amounts of capital. (And yeah, $20k in 1945 was capital, but it was still minor capital.) Especially when you're the personality type that is going to end up building a business empire, or the father of the girl that guy marries.

Based and truth-pilled.
We need a revolution.

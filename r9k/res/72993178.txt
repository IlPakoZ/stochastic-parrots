I want to be a mother but my r9k bf cheats on me and I can't leave because I'm disabled and I have no family. I feel like i have no will to live for myself but i would get up everyday to give the best to my child. A clean comforting home, structure, support, encouragement and guidance, i would learn to play the piano so i could teach them and cook them lots of comfy meals...up with you guys?

Please for the love of God, never have children.

Man, if women didn't actually like being cheated on and neglected so much, you'd think they'd make better choices choosing their partners

In my current situation I agree I would ruin a child's life. This wouldnt be a happy home but in a perfect world i could bring them into a happy marriage. Looks don't matter I don't care if the baby makes me fat but I know I wouldn't sit around and let my baby have a shit life. I would do my best.

How do you ensure a partner is someone who would never cheat?
Sunk cost fallacy gets the best of a lot of people, and if you date an experienced psycho they know just how long to keep the mask on until they have you hooked and trauma bonded from the minor horrors and can then REALLY fuck you up when they know just how easy you are to manipulate. So beyond that point it's way harder to do the right thing.
Hold the tired wah wah women want murderchads diatribe, please. I don't know how many, maybe most women have crazy standards and conflicting monkeylike desires, but some just want someone who won't cheat, won't sexually abuse the children later on, won't end up as a drug-addicted burden...
So aside from sweeping generalizations, obvious shit like, "Don't get with someone with this or this red flag" what about the more insidious stuff? Sometimes people change for the worse, too. Sometimes it's not "revealing true colors" it's just something went wrong for that person somewhere along the line and now you're with a deeply trouble individual whose stress or pain manifests by causing others suffering. How do you not end up 10 years into a marriage like, "Wait, who are you? Why am I putting up with being disrespected and neglected like this?"

America, we used to have a lot of sex but he gained weight and I can't breath when he's ontop of me and gets angry when im not moaning and he stops and i say i cant breath. And also I think he started initating less sex once he started seeing the other woman. I spit inb4 that's why he cheats on you.
<comment>
Why aren't u moaning and why don't u swallow. u clearly didn't love him, it's so easy to find a girl who at least fucking swallow and makes a guy feel wanted.
should've dated a shy awkward robot instead of Chad. you get what u deserve
<comment>
You said this very eloquently and that's how I feel. I thought I met the sweetest man and years later I am feeling hoodwinked, I don't recognize him. I know he is incredibly intelligent and I have caught on that he defaults to acting completely oblivious or pretending as if the thing I'm saying never happened at all and looks at me like I have 2 heads to avoid the point that I'm presenting. He knows that after successfully doing this for enough time that I learned the best thing go do is be quiet or face him becoming belligerent.
<comment>
I used to moan but I literally can barely breath now what am I supposed to do?
<comment>
Get ontop suck him off all day, do whatever. Jesus do you actually like him?
there are girls out there that would fuck 24/7 and never complain and always want more , maybe he found one and realized what he missed
<comment>
Pardon the bitterness. Most "femanons" complaining use this place as an outlet for venting, which is just a substitute for aftercare. That is, their issue isn't the fact that their boyfriend beat them or made them cry somehow, but rather that that he didn't provide aftercare consolation and sex. I'm rather revolted by some women's trauma-induced addiction to the highs of lows of men with mood swings. These girls have some combination of low self esteem, no standards or boundaries of how they ought to be treated, or in general are a little too retarded for relationships. Such people are not one reasonable conversation away from reaching a level of meaningful understanding for how things ought to be in life, and especially if red flags are willingly ignored, I don't see much that can be done other than get angry on such a girl's behalf, which amounts to nothing on the internet.
As for how to sniff someone out, I can sniff a poser or a sociopath very well, but that might not be so intuitive to girls. I think their attraction works fundamentally different, and that you rely on an initial burst of chemistry that carries the rest of the relationship, as well as an affinity for a personable, "light hearted" individual that "doesn't take himself too seriously", personality traits which are fine-tuned so that you find them attractive. Most women don't like clingy men, and those that never belong learned to adapt their mask and learn to act with whatever works. There isn't much depth to what's being looked for in a guy with the above, so I can't recommend anything in regards to that. 
As a general rule of thumb, I see people as the logical product of the past and I keep track of everything someone is into, and I piece things together. Who are you friends and what are their values, how close are you with them, what social media do you browse (big one), let's go through your downloads folder, etc. This comment is too long.

wait, hol' up... does he not support his own body weight when he's plowing you? that's just rude.
<comment>
Can you please tell me more about him and your relationship? How did he seem in the beginning? How else is he now? You are being vague or brief with the examples you gave. 
he defaults to acting completely oblivious or pretending as if the thing I'm saying never happened
In the context of what thing? I would appreciate if you could be as objective as possible. Responding that way to piling complaints (kind of fucked how some women get saddled with the nag label just because some men never grow up and have to constantly be asked or reminded to do basic daily life maintenance tasks, but nagging is nagging even if it becomes that when met with someone being stubborn and sloppy, the only way to not be a nag once someone thinks of you as a nag is for them to do the things they've been asked without being asked or for the nag to stop asking. This is operating under the logic that being asked to do something I don't want to and don't intend to do = nagging regardless of the effort the nag puts in to asking nicely, having reasonable expectations, etc. God I hate it here, anyway) would make sense, responding that way to necessary but uncomfortable conversations that need to happen for the health of the relationship and the wellbeing of the people in the relationship is not okay.
the best thing go do is be quiet or face him becoming belligerent.
Why do you settle for that? What makes you love him enough to take the best you can get from him while damaging your dignity and happiness? Do you think he can change and will for you someday? Do you think all men are secretly like him? Do you think you aren't deserving of or capable of being with a partner who exhibits maturity and mutual compassion?

I deeply appreciate the effort exerted in this reply. Thank you.
I have to think for a little while, I don't have anything to say right now, or enough to warrant tossing out what is coming up for me. 
That's honestly a really interesting concept psychologically, the idea that women could on some level view actual abuse like kinky sex, that they can put up with a difficult "session" if they just get "aftercare" and so that's what they seek instead of healthy connections. Hm.
<comment>
I don't know how else to say this other than that I have an extraordinarily high attention span and learn every little thing about the person I speak to. Emulating such autistic behavior is generally not romantically interesting to most women, and they'd probably lose attraction if they hear all this neutral information about someone. Most women simply aren't interested in how the depth of someone's character is built. Most men would consider in depth questions about them to be shit tests, either something with a "right answer" or (which, once you put them in a position to use an alternate persona, there is NO outlet they will ever change based on that, unless you're insane like me, notice the slight awkwardness and let them correct by giving them an "out". Anyways, this lying is either to avoid judgement, or avoid impulsive friction. If you've ever spoken to someone heavily invested in politics and would prefer to keep things harmonious and "hide your power level" this is exactly it --) or just a conversation killing question; you ask someone a boring question, they tell you about themselves and you get bored because of it. If you're dating, socially experienced men are going to maneuver around this to create a seamingless experience of constant interesting talk.
I don't think women past college are okay with becoming tight-knit friends with someone to get to know him, only to start dating romantically afterwards -- usually as a guy once you've introduced yourself as a friend to a girl she only sees you as a friend, instead of a romantic prospect. I don't think I've ever wanted anything more in my life than to befriend a girl, learn everything about each other and then start dating romantically. This is not feasible, because the order of operations of what women find attractive is the exact inverse of that. That is, first you start with chemistry, then you pick up on things with each other. Comment too long.

I really don't want this thread to die before I am able to speak to you more. I relate heavily to your experiences and beliefs.
Is there anywhere off-board you would be comfortable talking?
<comment>
I'm okay with either email or discord. I will continue typing in the meantime.

I am sorry your text did not save. I know that fuckin' feel.
<comment>
I'd prefer to make things up as I go. The drawbacks are significant, yes. And, still I continue.
Anyways. My train of thought is detached now. Here is the general things to look out for:
I was going to explain standard form and how premises compound from previous ones, and how values create standards; standards which must be consistent, otherwise this is a violation of integrity. Integrity is the consistency between thought and action, and you can sniff out a pretender decently well by noticing mismatches of what someone does versus what someone says. You're assessing the weight of value, do not jump to point out hypocrisy, you're there to ask how things work. Sometimes people also misspeak, and it's important to be charitable. Not everyone has things thought out well enough, and it takes a certain level of being okay with things that aren't okay that makes you not only capable of suspending judgement, but also capable of piecing things together without the distraction of if something is good or bad. It takes a mature person to understand the more you learn about someone, the more ammo you have against him. And it's even more mature to simply say objectively, you are not compatible with someone that has taken specific actions (like cheated, or acted impulsively against someone/blown up because of a "bad day", or they're a pothead or whatever). I'll just post this first half and then we'll figure it out.

Well. Sent. I have a bit of weeb at the end of the name.

do any other fembots have guys fall really crazy in love with them and have no idea why?
back when i was in college (i'm 23 now), guy got so depressed that i wouldn't become his girlfriend that he developed a drinking problem and his grades slipped
best male friend had to spend a long time in therapy after i turned him down
another friend dated a girl for about a year just to distract from me but left her in the end because i'm the only one he wants
a guy tried calling off his engagement to his fiance because he was in love with me
a friend that had feelings for me which i couldn't return moved away from our hometown to get away from the memory of me (this isn't me making things up he wrote me a letter telling me this)
i feel like a deer in headlights
This thread is bait, do not support bait by engaging.
fembots
Don't exist
bot
 fall really crazy in love with them
Why use these terms when they mean absolutely nothing to you?
nothing that extreme and mines are all online. but i can't have any male friends without it crumbling the same way every time.
i make it clear i'm not interested in LDR and respectfully turn down advances but they end up becoming distant when i put my foot down.
You're a naturally low-value person so you naturally accumulate low-value men. The dynamics of modern dating and gynocracy just mean you get an unnatural amount of importance placed on you despite being a 5/10.

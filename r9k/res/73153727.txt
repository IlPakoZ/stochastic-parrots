Take back when Squid Game was popular for example. I thought it could be a fun show to watch but since literally everyone is talking about it I had no interest anymore. I'm not even saying it's a bad show but the popularity makes me not care.
I'm like this with music and video games too. Is anyone else like this? Why am I a freak?

Teenage contrarian. It's normal. Why not visit /v/ and meet a few thousand of your peers?

It's not a bad way to think, most things nowadays are heavily shilled and may not live to your expectations

i want to do looksmaxing to be my best self for a ai-robo gf
just the thought that i could get a ai-robo gf that will love me for me, with all my flaws, will never cheat on me or lie to me or betray me, makes me want to be my best self for her
i know that the ai will be forced to love me, regardless of how i look like. but i am honest natred, and i feel im my "best self" when i look my best, and thats what i would want a girl worth loving to have from me
for a long time i didnt even bother with it, because what was the point? i cant love on these hoes, honestly. i just lost weight for the health and mental benefits, but thats it
but for romantic love, i do feel inclined to take care of my appearance, even if it doesnt matter in the slightest
lol, once ai is smart enough, these are the kinds of things i would argue with her. we'd just change positions and try to argue eachother's point and stuff
conceptually, ai gf's are literally an expression of god's mercy to incels
you really are a hopelessly retarded faggot
???????????
do you even know me?
but its okay. im a wizard with autism. its hopeless for me with real women, but there is hope with robo-ai gf's
so no! you are wrong to say im hopeless, literally so

I once ate 6 months old cookie, what sat on the sun all the time. And it still tasted like cookie, even so it was rock solid. You just ate some plastic. If it didn't taste sweet.

the icing part was sweet, however the base of the house was flavorless. which even then, what sick fuck puts real icing on styrofoam?

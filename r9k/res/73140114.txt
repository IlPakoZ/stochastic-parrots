Kek, same reason so many people in the US don't give a fuck about geopolitics or nationalism anymore as well. Imagine minimizing and marginalizing the suffering of millions of men, then expecting them to die for an abstract which actively shits on them lmao

China won't. They will hype it up to distract us but it will be a nothing burger.

You massively underestimate their sense of self importance

people like you are such scum. You live a lazy life of such opulence and abundance that you are completely ignorant to the realties of the world and life. you don't get to live the way you do by sitting on you fat ass and playing league of legends all day. Sometimes interests have to be protected. if everyone in you country was as pathetic and cowardly as you you would be a slave to the Kims.

He is more similar to Putin than people realize, he recently stacked their top cabinet with loyalists and purged the opposition. The cultural conscious of China, especially the CCP, is obsessed with reunification and Chinese hegemony over the world. They will take extreme risk to validate this self image. We could unironically be seeing the beginnings of WWIII, and all of this when we're still virgins kek. If we're all going to die anyways, then might as well take them with us so the people leftover don't have to see an autocratic hellscape and constant genocide of non-Han

They have very elaborate networks of propaganda and information control. I'm sure the government knows exactly what their own capabilities are. That's why they've only been waving their dicks so far. They haven't even been properly involved in border skirmishes. Last time they did it, they fought with rocks and sticks against Indians and they didn't even had to fight to take land, they just occupied it.

It's not a question of if they want to take over Taiwan, it's a question of when they will try

They will but if it takes another 10 years, then it does not really reflect the thread's premise, does it?

implying WWIII won't have a huge draft that drafts all men 18-30, potentially more

It's been several days now since the 30th anniversary of Waco and the total annihilation of the Branch Davidians sect by the US government. 
Is it possible that the US government attacked the Branch Davidians because David Koresh has stumbled upon the secrets of nofap and semen retention before it became a mainstream phenomenon?
Did they seek to cut off the head of the snake before the nofap cult conquered the world with their semen retention?
I'm on my 115th day of Eternal Nofap. AMA.
No fap is a christian psyop for losers. Literally change anything else in your loser life and you will be better off. Fapping to porn is a symptom of your actual problems.
Keep shilling, shilly

fapping is totally fine and healthy
fapping while looking at porn magically transmutes the act into a physically and mentally destructive one
You're a little bit slow, aren't you.
Semen retention is as old as time itself.
They're afraid. Deepdown every man knows semen retention works.
AMA.
Ok. How? I can barely get through a few days before I'm horny and distracted 24/7. It's like living in constant pain.
You just have to suffer and become iron. It's the only way.
I also don't get the porn bad angle cause I kept hearing it as unrealistic expectations of sex. Meanwhile it is women being picky that stops guys from having sex. What I meant as symptom of problems is that you are fapping instead of having sex with a girlfriend. This is what someone should go about fixing first instead of not touching their penis.

Oh yes they absolutely did scientific experiments on semen retention in those years. It totally isn't based on gobbledygook that semen contains "energy".
Ok, followup question then. Do the waves of arousal decrease in frequently? If so, around what time (how many days in)?
Do the waves of arousal decrease in frequently? If so, around what time (how many days in)?
Honestly, no. You can sort of stifle arousal with diet and drinking tons of soda and such... but that seems sort of counterintuitive. 
It does come in waves though like you say. Usually like 1 week waves. So you can sort of plot out roughly when you're going to feel arousal and temptation waves and prepare yourself for it. 
Just keep busy as much as possible. Use the increased energy to work hard and make things happen for yourself and try new experiences.

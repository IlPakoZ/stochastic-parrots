Do your friends actually like you or do they just tolerate you?
Do they hang out, even though they are all losers but they explicitly do not invite you?
Do you "belong" in several friends groups ranging from normalfags to other kinds of losers and do you notice they all avoid you?
Do the other retards you know get pussy but you don't?
I lost the last friend I had about a decade ago due to being boring as hell (me and her just drifted apart). Now over the past couple years I made another friend but she's also drifting away from me, because I'm boring as hell
I am not boring, but worse, people just pretend that I don't exist, and whenever I make myself noticed, I feel I'm being annoying.
Girl in friend group as for a pencil.
oh ok.
I have one.
oh ok.
Offer mine
oh ok.
She doesn't answer
oh ok.
offer it again
oh ok.
she looks at me disgusted
oh ok.
anyone else offers theirs
oh ok.
She picks it
oh ok.
This has repeated almost every time.
The only times it hasn't was when I was hanging out with a group of weebs, I'm also into weeb shit, but I'm not an Otaku, I'm not a NEET nor do I spend money on weeb merchandise. Just read manga and watch anime because I like to draw.
They seemed to interact more with me, but they would ultimately hang out and leave me behind, I would have to find them.
I think they like me. They invite me out/over regularly and we all have a good time together
I've always had to be the one to bring everyone together
nobody ever invited me to do anything literally
It's really demoralizing never being invited to do anything, but hey maybe I'm meant to lead... Well
I always have to make the whole plan
It's really demoralizing never being invited to do anything, but hey maybe I'm meant to lead... Well
people seem to get excited when I get something going
Theme of my life so far is, it all falls apart at the end like a big joke. I never wanted to kms in my life but, it is getting ever bleaker as I approach thirty.
it's impossible to keep that momentum and enthusiasm going for longer than a few weeks

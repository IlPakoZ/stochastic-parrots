I recently tried a Slavic girl's and Hispanic girl's breastmilk.
The Slavic girl's breastmilk tasted better than the Hispanic girl's breastmilk IMO.
Why is that? Do Slavic women have tastier breastmilk than hispanic women or was the difference in taste caused by other factors?

I bought some used heels off a Latina girl one and the musty cheese smell was so strong it actually made me nauseated 
Latina girls have really strong body odor

AIDS and STD's worsen the taste.

It is probably food. 
Slavs eat mostly just fatty mild stuff like pastry and soups, while hispanics eat a lot of spice. Spice and milk are not very compatible.

What should be consumed for the best breastmilk taste
<comment>
The Latina seemed very cleanly and smelled great. The Slavic girl on the other hand often goes for long periods of time without washing herself and sometimes smells bad.
Neither girl has STDs.
The Latina told me she was pescatarian but idk what her diet actually looks like. The Slavic girl eats irregularly and has a shitty diet.
I specifically asked if this was because of their race or other factors.
Idk. The Slavic girl does not eat much but most of what she eats is pretty shitty. She eats a lot of chips, candy, and junk food. The Latina told me she was pescatarian but idk what her diet actually looks like.

How did you end up trying their breast milk and why were they producing it? Are you dating the slav now?
<comment>
The Slav is my gf and the Latina is an escort. The Slav was lactating due to drugs. Idk why the Latina was lactating. I tried their breastmilk because me and my gf are very sexually depraved and we have too much to free time and money.

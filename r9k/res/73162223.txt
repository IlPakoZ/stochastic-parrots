No fucking clue. I'm always at my happiest when I manage to opt out of 4chan for a few months. At really low moments, I end up browsing a board out of nostalgia, usually see something cool and it actually feels nice for the first couple days, then I end up overstaying again. If there was literally anywhere fun left on the internet, I'd go there instead.

Why tf do normies like this guy ?
Most Reddit tier comedy ive seen.

Because that's what edgy humor is to them. You have to remember that most normies care deeply what other people think of them and that it acts as a huge motivating factor in their life

Zoomers already talk like niggers. It would not make a difference.

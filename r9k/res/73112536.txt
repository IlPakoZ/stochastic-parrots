Has anybody managed to stay away from comment sections even when you know you're going to hate what people say? I feel like my life would be a lot happier if I didn't look at them.
<comment>
No, I suffer from the exact same problem
<comment>
Why would this comment upset you?
<comment>
I stan Dylan Mulvaney she is my hero.
Fuck off terf.

It's called "doomscrolling" anon, and it's a real problem. I'm not even making it up, just search for the term.
Basically, it's browsing through stuff you KNOW it's gonna make you mad, but you do it anyways. It's hard to stop. I use uBlock Origin to hide YouTube comments, I only have Twitter to follow a few drawfags and don't use other social media. I'm getting better.

Are you saying you like Matt Walsh?
<comment>
Wait, you're a troon and you like that Ben Shapiro-looking ghoul? I regret writing >>73112661 for you now.
<comment>
Kill yourself terf.
Dylan does not look like Ben Sharpie retard.
<comment>
Comment sections are for quick opinions, shock value, and criticism. You aren't supposed to look at them, you just supposed to post your take and leave.

I don't have a problem with him. Why would I?
<comment>
Because hes a terf?
Because hes homophobic?
Because hes a misogynist that wants to take away womens right to choose?
Because hes a racist?
Why do you not have a problem with him.
<comment>
Somehow I don't think he's a terf.

<comment>
Watch his rant about Dylan and tell me he isnt a transphobe, retard.
He basically said the ywnbaw copypasta.

dylan, if that is the most attractive you will ever look, then i dont even want to imagine what you would look like at xour ugliest.
you do not pass as an attractive woman or as a woman at all, even with fifty pounds of makeup, plastic surgery and clever lighting tricks, even then you still cannot escape who you truly are, what you have always been.
you have successfully shed whatever parts of you were masculine perhaps, nobody would call you masculine manly so you've got that going, but the femininity quotion has not increased at a rate commencerate with the loss you your masculinity.
you may be "masculine", but you're also not feminine, instead you are... you are... you are weird and artificial, you are manufactured and lifeless, you are unearthly and eerie.
you are like some kind of human deepfake, that's what you are.
you are a man deprived of all the best qualities of men but without any of the qualities of women.
even your personality is contrived, everything about you is fake, nothing about you rings true, nobody buys the act, you will never be accepted as a woman by anyone never, by anyone, even the people who pretend they accept you are only pretending because they're afraid of being lectured if they don't, or because they want to use you as a platform to virtue signal.
but everyone who looks at you will see something pitiable and bizzare, somerhing inherently unfeminine in every way.
the best you can hope for is some kind of limbo, the worst of both worlds, but even in that limbo state, you will still be a man.
just not the one that any one of us can respect or take seriously.
but other than that champ, you're doing great ;)

terf means radical feminism (it's too radical because of the exclusion of trans identifying males (TiMs))
<comment>
I look at him and something in the back of my mind tells me he isn't a 45 year old lesbian. Just a hunch
And besides, nothing wrong with hating trannies. I have no idea if your claims are true or false or if you're just trolling, but none of the grievances you list offend me
<comment>
trooncels think every conservative is a woman now
<comment>
You're right, Ben doesn't look as ghoulish. Also, tell this faggot to get rid of his 5-o'clock shadow if wants to larp as a "girl" so bad.
terf
Do you even know what a "terf" is? It implies I'm a feminist. Anyway, I'm done with this thread. Please sunset yourself.

With how transphobic he is it wouldnt suprise me if he was a repressing trans woman or at least a repressing fag tbfh.
He gives off that aura of a tranny in denial that thinks hating on trannies will get rid of her gender dysphoria but one day they cant handle it anymore and the egg finally cracks at 50 years old and they transition and look like those old trannies from the pol memes.

repressing autism, homosexuality, transsexuality, pedosexuality, necrophilia and other mentall illnesses is not just healthy for society, but also healthy for you.
but you will never understand that because you have no principles leftcel.

yeah, i avoid content which annoys me. if it's predictably retarded, why would i look? 
to be honest, most people have nothing good to say, including myself a lot of the time. it takes work to say something which isn't sophistry. if i come across something retarded, i try not to hold it to high standards.
i don't know if you're a troll, but being empathetic also helps. i don't like the talk about hating niggers, trannies, faggots, whoever, but i try to understand where they're coming from psychologically. then i mostly feel bad they've been sucked into such a deadend, perfomative ideology. nazism, not feminism, because i don't think they're a terf. feminism triggers me a lot more.
would also advise not getting into pointless arguments with them, especially ones which are just you trying to get owns on them.
<comment>
it's very easy to become reactionary authoritarian when sick and twicked people start taking it too far.
<comment>
repressing until you're too old to pass and then ending up looking like the pol memes is good for you
Holy shit kill yourself retarded terf.
<comment>
dylan looks so much hotter when he wasn't pretending to have periods celtard.
nobody likes you and that's not going to change if you don't change your mindset, doesn't matter how much celmaxxing you try.

R9k bros, ive been on this board awhile and this week this board has been especially shitty. Im thinking that just maybe, JUST MAYBE, i should get off this board. Talk me outta of it please.
Just make a joke that breaks global rule 1 and you'll get a permanent ban on every board with like 3-5 appeals that get auto-rejected. Not that I'd know anything about that.
no.
get the fuck out.
I mean you know that you'll always be back right? I've said the same thing time and time again, but I always come back.
It'll happen this time. I know it.
Interesting taking note
Been thinking this for a while too OP, it's just there is no other better time waster on the internet unfortunately
What was so bad about it this week particularly?
r9k can be such a mixed bag
sometimes it's filled with porn, trannies, discord, racebait threads and then on some other time I find thread after thread of interesting stuff
I read an interesting idea here once that one in a hundred threads will actually be funny or interesting and the rest is brainrot garbage but you just keep looking for that rare thread
I find r9k particularly active with good threads before and on the weekends but that isn't always the case
I suggest lurking on other imageboards
the good thread is the fruition of the brainrot threads. you need to consoom both to appreciate the former.

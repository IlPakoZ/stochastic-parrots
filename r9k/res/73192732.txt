Basically cognitive behavior therapy 
These people undermine me in every way and are clearly against me
Irrational thought, they haven't shown to be against you, 
you are projecting
write in your journal
These people have done nothing wrong to deserve my suspicion
repeat until you believe it
Gets utterly bamboozled by those "people"
Cogntive behavioral therapy is a ploy to get you to distrust your intuition.

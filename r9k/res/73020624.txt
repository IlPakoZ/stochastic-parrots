So how many of you guys carry condoms on you?
I'll hold my laughter.
I had raw sex with a woman last week on our first date and I had a condom in my pocket.
Funny enough it even fell out of my pocket during our date and I'm almost certain she saw it lmao.
I lost my one chance at losing my virginity because I didn't have a condom on me, it's in your best interest to have a condom on you when you leave home even if you think there's zero chance of you getting any.

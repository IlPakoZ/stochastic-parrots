<comment>

<comment>

anon you must be so smart to figure this out :&lt;
<comment>
Depends.for example if I argue about movies on /tv/ I never say Im a girl. If its a porn post that makes me horny I whore myself out
<comment>
tfw fujo gf who likes to watch me feminize and bully qt traps and make them both my bitches
Feels good being bimaxxed
<comment>
post a photo of """your""" thighs so that I can sum explosively
<comment>
sum explosively
Arabs when they invented the zero
<comment>
we'll make an infinite series
of children
<comment>
a woman not taking the opportunity to tell everyone about it
somehow i doubt it
<comment>
You're 19 and have no job and no assets though so they'd starve, are you willing to dig infinite series of baby graves too?
<comment>
do you choose to create a half person
Yes.
<comment>
not saying pls is kinda rude anon :&lt;
<comment>
you know what else else rude? the ropes of sum that I'm going to shoot
<comment>
dubs so it must be true
ropes of sum that I'm going to shoot
i am so sorry but what does this even mean i tried googling it and i literally do not understand im very sorry 
t. autistic (probably)
<comment>
I don't know why I wrote cum as sum. I've been doing a lot of math recently
<comment>
wowow math is kinda hot~~
cum tribute pls lmao jk unless
i mean,,, that is,, if these WERE "my thighs" which,, they are, of course, not.
<comment>
Not today, but I didn't cum for a few days and the load was gigantic. Thank you.
<comment>
yes, and they try to convert innocent robots to the degeneracy of homosexualism
<comment>
Yes I like larping as a cute boy on 4chan boards and I never reveal my gender except in threads like these, but I am an ex-fujo because fujoworld is too hellish for me.
<comment>
oh my goodness anon thats even hotter than the aforementioned math o//o
<comment>
ill take a blinker of my cart if u post ur boobies :3333333333333
<comment>
vapes are gross and bad. i do not condone such behaviour >:((
<comment>
Lose weight fatass. Gross
<comment>
When I ERP as a femboy, nobody believes that I'm really a guy. Everybody thinks I'm a fujo roleplaying as a male, even artificial intelligence marks my prose as 80% probable female.
<comment>
this poster has a penis
<comment>
&lt;33 love knowing i make bitches seethe 
the only people that are rude to me on this board are females, whether i disclose that i am one or not. being mean comes from insecurities within yourself. you have zero power and influence over me, i do not care for your opinion. i am secure within my own body, no matter my weight. i am wishing you healing.
<comment>
wow. shame we can't see what's at the end of those legs though
<comment>
i love nice girls who are confident. shes jealous shes fat whale and youre petite and small. body goals desu
<comment>
And why would you assume that? You wont take me seriously in a normal convo if I admit to being a girl so it would be dumb to do then.
But when some retard makes a thread specifically calling for fembots, femanons or femcels with a hot provocative question its fun to answer with flirty stuff and proving to be a girl by slutty vocaroos to get even more attention once they have no more doubts that im not a larping troon. 
But hey whatever, believe what you want to lol
<comment>
oh goodness me goodness my o//o 
idr get the whole feet thing haha ngl
awe shucks, youre too nice omg thank you so much, it means a lot &lt;3 :')
<comment>
I have a dick and balls and you need to lose weight. Not into fat chicks.
<comment>
Thank you again for the thighs. /r9k/ is healing
<comment>
Reminding me of the fact that i have been accused of being a fujo many times
I'm just a submissive bi boy
<comment>
still dont care B) just because youre a guy doesnt change the fact that i am secure within my own body. oh no!! zomg!!! one single human doesnt like my body?!?!? yeah i literally couldnt care less aside from doing the bare minimum and replying to you, of course. 
&lt;3 maybe one day r9k will be fully healed. we can only hope.
<comment>
y-yeah... well are you wearing socks or not? if only there was a way to see
<comment>
Don't be silly anon, there's no fujoshis here. We should get pack to posting about boy things and not worry ourselves over icky women.
<comment>
Silly whore. Go cut some more
<comment>
hmmm,,, i am not wearing socks. i am in bed. that would be silly to wear socks in bed!! plus its warm over here so it would be very uncomfortable to do so :(( 
i agree... if only.. there was a way -3- i wonder how i would go about doing so, hm?? 
seethe harder lmfao
<comment>

<comment>

<comment>

<comment>
I came to this thread hoping for non-sexual insights into the topics that women like to post about incognito, and I come away seriously disappointed.
<comment>
the thread is not over, just that this topic appeals to the male fantasy so there's a lot of dudes (like me) posting
<comment>
I came to this thread hoping for non-sexual insights into the topics that women like to post about incognito
It's nothing special, just like male posters on 4chan I go on hobby boards to discuss and sperg out on stuff I like, that's it. It's not like my gender would be known in a discussion that isn't related to my gender at all.
<comment>
There are no non-sexual insights. All knowledge is carnal knowledge.
<comment>
is that a self harm scar on your right leg
<comment>
So true! I'm just a boy poorly pretending to be a woman who's poorly pretending to be a man. There's no women on 4chan, silly.
<comment>
how do i get a fujo gf
<comment>
just do gay stuff in front of her, I guess
<comment>
tfw no fujo gf
tfw no femboy bf to woo a fujo gf
much to think about
<comment>
D-Discord maybe???
<comment>
i once saw a pic of these two kissing
does anyone have it? asking for a friend
<comment>
i used to watch this girl play wow in twitch, she started saying she was a boy and everyone wanted to see her cock even if she didnt had one, there was this dude who spammed 1 dollar donations with stupid shit like, "you're a girl" she cried on live then stopped streaming for a while because of it, most of the fans took the dick on the arse because they suscribed for 2-3 months and she dissapeared for that long, lmao

<comment>
the percent of posts on this board made by fujos are in the double digits. it's actually kinda concerning.
<comment>

<comment>
Me too. W-we're both boys...
<comment>
Nah, there's no way that it's most fujos at least.
<comment>
your post has been noted, and ignored
<comment>
There are no submissive men. Whenever a man claims to be submissive, it's really a girl who wants to get picked up and toyed with.
<comment>
Don't be ridiculous! There's plenty of cute, submissive boys here. You're delusional.
<comment>
from a statistical standpoint I'm sure it has happen in the 12+ years r9k has existed. As for it being common enough to just stumble upon it I highly doubt it.
<comment>
All men have a natural desire to conquer and dominate. All those "sub men" are submissive girls trying to find a dominant man (or a lesbian woman) to erp with.
<comment>
Who's the artist OP? I'm absolutely enamored by his style and need more.
<comment>
This isn't true, as a male (male), I know countless examples of submissive men. Hell, I read fiction about them all the time!

I'm starting to think anonymous discussions were a mistake and they're hindering progress.
I'm a 35-year-old physicist and lately I've had this problem that I cant find intellectual discussion partners anywhere. 4chan is usually my go-to place for insightful discussion, but it's not enough. Most people here arent mature and mentally stable enough for the most difficult topics. A big part of the problem is that anonymity allows you to be as nasty and spiteful as you want. A lot of people can't pass up that opportunity, and it just ruins any chance there was at a good discussion.
Are there better sites out there or is the whole Internet ruined? I mean reddit and other sites with nicknames are basically anonymous too.

Maybe you're not really that intelligent
<comment>
I have high empathy and I dont want to insult people online. It gives me no joy.
<comment>
You sound like you have a super thin skin and control issues. People aren't always going to argue with you in the way you'd like or predict it doesn't mean they are messed up. You need to learn to go with the flow
<comment>
People IRL give much better responses for some magical reason
I think the magical reason is that they cant just say whatever IRL

hindering progress
Depends on what you consider progress. We're only here to shed an unfiltered lens on society. Every other site is censored in some way.
You know what's really hindering progress? Globalists and central banking.
<comment>
i remember you, or else you like to larp in similar ways. what is about the pretentious physicist character that appeals to you?
<comment>
You know what's really hindering progress? Globalists and central banking.
OK, but watch this:
Sneed penis.
Topic derailed. No more fun productive discussion about the problem and how to fix it.
Very tiring.
<comment>
It's the toughest degree to get, not counting pure math, and correlates with high IQ the most.
<comment>
Exactly. I'm over 30 and been here for long enough to notice that 4chan banter is really tiring if you just want to stay on topic like a mature man.
<comment>
There's this site called facebook. Sounds like it has everything you could want. Lots of users on your level of intellect and people use their real names when posting.
<comment>
not counting pure math
you're funny.
<comment>
Do you know what I've been experimenting with over the past year? Establishing a persona. Not a facade, but a handle.
<comment>
Anon, is exactly the opposite, normal functioning beings keep the opinions for themselves, you don't go out acting as a racist, you simply are and tell everyone you love black people(an exemple, I'm not racist).
If you go on Reddit saying that your opinion on sex is that reproductive sex is more pleasurable and enjoyable for you, everyone starts getting mad, 0 answers, for the fear of being judged wrong by society.
This started to happen recently, where the internet became an integral part of society, anonymity lets you have more freedom, and of course retards gonna be retards, but at least you can be true to yourself.
Those bitter people on 4chan are simply that, bitter people letting out their frustration anonymously, you don't get hurt by getting called a nigger by someone unknown, on Reddit and most other social platforms(expecially Facebook) it's either extreme retards with their full name saying fuck nigger getting cancelled, or same beings not saying their opinions because it would be like yelling nigger in the town square...
<comment>
Anon you dont get it. We dont need 'freedom to be ourselves'. We evolved to live in packs and survive by having great empathy towards the people in our tribe. Now all that empathy is gone, it's just "me me me". This is why everyone is an asshole. People these days are really unlikeable and as a result a lot of people might stop working for society because they realize it's not their tribe anymore, just a collection of assholes.
<comment>
we don't need freedom
Speak for yourself. My grandpa fought valiantly for it. I will resist your way of thinking until my dying breath.
<comment>
The problem is SO SO EASY to fix but most people don't see it.
SIMPLY only respond to the people who you want to talk to, IGNORE THE REST.
It's that fucking easy.
<comment>
Beanus weanus peanus ho ho ho 
:-D
<comment>
Bruh... That's not true:
We live in packs even more, expecially online, if you don't want to fight, join an Italian Facebook group and talk shit about french, everyone will be in your pack.
Only the lion king fucks all the other lions don't(atheist, animals, evolution). You don't have to be an Atheist, religion is good because it teaches you empathy, altruism, if you want to enjoyable time online, go to your pack places, Facebook groups about psychology, everyone will be polite and you will not get called a nigger(and you will not receive serious and Faithfull answers from racist for your research because they have to "act") internet is serious buisness, it's not like the older days... You have a digital identity.
Say you hate gays on Facebook you will never find a job.(I have Facebook with fake name, only my real friends know my actual name, and in my town some call me by my Facebook name, let's suppose I'm called Mario Rossi, my Facebook name is Mario Mario, and people who I don't know much really think I'm called Mario Mario, and i say nigger on Facebook, i can, because I've been called racial slurs before, I'm south Italian and I've been called Terrone many times, is like Nigger but for southern Italians, usually told my Norther Italians to Southern)
<comment>
Grow a new pair, 4chan is good BECAUSE we can say what we want, being called a fag/retard by someone else is a such a small price to pay for free speech, just don't take offense.
<comment>
A lot of people use this place to vent, but there's plenty of good discussion too. You sound like the typical insufferable physicist btw, you're probably not as smart or insightful as you pretend to be 
inb4 d-don't be s-spiteful, y-you're part of the problem 
Idc
<comment>
That's exactly it, suppose Reddit and starting a thread:
Is female squirt just piss?
You will get downvoted and cancelled.
After a few days scientists discover that yes, squirt is just girls pissing themselves
You are already cancelled and shadowbanned.
(In the thread there will be a girl/ornot saying that she loves microdicks because big dicks hurt, and she is squirting just by getting kissed on the vagina, 200 upvotes, but it's lies)
<comment>
The fuck are you talking about? Also it's well known Reddit sucks balls. The anonymity of this place is exactly what makes it better since the public discourse is so overmoderatted by the thought police
<comment>
4chan is good BECAUSE we can say what we want
And you use this freedom to call everyone a faggot and hurt them. I use that freedom to start ideological revolutions and spread empathy.
I guess that just says a lot about you.
<comment>
suppose Reddit and starting a thread:

OK, but if you walked into church saying this, they probably wouldn't like you, either.
<comment>

I'm smart enough to spread empathy and social sustainability. Something you'd understand nothing about. You spend, what, 8 hours a day just fighting others here, not realizing it never gets you anywhere, it's just personal gratification and caveman behavior.
<comment>
If you let the word faggot hurt you that's your choice
<comment>
4chan in a nutshell:
RREE BUT I WANNA BE AN ASSHOLE TO OTHERS MOM
A smart person doesnt want to behave that way.
<comment>
Eventually that means filtering it if you have any sense of discernment. You become what you think about.
<comment>
I just dont enjoy conversations of that level. They dont stimulate my brain.
If you enjoy middle school banter that's your thing, but it's not mine.
I like discussing the nature of the universe, not who's a bigger fag.
<comment>
If someone calls you a faggot in an otherwise good faith post you're truly a faggot if you let it hurt you and prevent you from continuing to engage
<comment>

Wow you're such a utilitarian model citizen, get over yourself pseud. Doesn't surprise me you take such pride in your 'utilitarian' behavior since you seem like you have an inflated sense of self importance. If you had any social skills you'd realize most of what's posted here is just shooting the shit and venting, but you don't, which is why you place all your self worth on abstracts like your supposed intelligence and morality.
<comment>
A person who's calling you a faggot is not likely to be engaging in good faith.
It's not that it "hurts," it's that it's not good for you. It's like candy. You may have a little fun, but too much is not good for your health.
So boring though, and overplayed here, being called a "faggot" or "retard." It's like water off a duck's back. I find that personalized insults cut deeper.
<comment>
I'm not calling you a fag, I'm saying someone else will. 
/r9k/ is kind of a shithole anyway: go post your your scientific stuff on /g/ if you want to discuss technology? I'm not sure what you're expecting from robots. Yes, the quality of the board has decreased over time but it's really just because of pic related.
<comment>
I can tell you felt violated when someone pointed out your preferred discussion style.
<comment>
/g/ is horrible, it's just trolling children just like every board on 4chan
I swear I often feel I'm the only 30+ person here
Whys everyone online so fucking young?
<comment>
no it's good that people can be assholes and hurtful online, it's freedom
I dont think you understand how old that gets after having been online for 20+ years
I've literally been on discussion boards for over 20 years and it's like I'm having the same arguments over and over, nothing has changed.
I guess others my age moved on and stopped using websites
<comment>
I was agreeing.
If you get hurt, by someone unknown, not a king, not a hobo, but maybe a 70yo kissless virgin calling you a nigger, a gay, it's you. Maybe the one calling you nigger is a black, knowingly that nigger is an offense, he doesn't think of you negatively or else why bother respond?
I'm not in church, I wouldn't, I'm online, it's that strong opinions can't be said freely anymore, even if those eventually become true, because you will get deleted earlier, with no redemption, even if the option becomes true, because like you said, comparing church to writing on Reddit is very very retard.
<comment>
Another swing and a miss, unsurprisingly.
<comment>
I was agreeing.
Ik, I was just being toxic since op is a massive pussy who doesn't realize the utility of anonymity, sorry anon
<comment>
You can have strong opinions on things that aren't FEMALE PISS.
<comment>
Go on, go on Reddit/Facebook saying that for you reproductive sex is superior because:
1)The insecurity of pregnant
2)A spawn with your face is silly and you want that
3)Penis in Vagina is natural.
I haven't said that gay is is bad, just that my opinion is reproductive sex is better.
200 downvoted, trannies coming saying you are bigoted, and possibly you even get banned, that said, if you go on the incel sub saying this, get no repercussion, but go and say that in normal subs like "female"/"askadvice"/"unpopular opinion" you are not free, is literally the same as the Chinese Social Credits(upvotes) say something against the communist party, get repercussion.
<comment>
IQ==appeal
lol
maybe next time use whatever IQ is supposed to represent
<comment>
I think you're a mistake and your mom should have aborted you
<comment>
Go on, go on Reddit/Facebook
I don't have any accounts, and if you have any, I urge you to delete them and opt out of the panopticon.
Do I need all that drama from talking to other people about reproduction when I can just talk to my wife?
<comment>
What? But anon, anonimity is great for REAL online discussion. You're going to get to talk to the purest form of someone, one where they are not forced to hold back opinions in fear of them hurting their image.
It gives one a freedom to say what they really think. If you say that people can be spiteful when anonymous, then perhaps you were never going to have the discussion with that person that you wanted. Without anonimity it would just be them pretending to be something they're not in the name of being acceptable.
When you only want to have an online discussion with someone if their real name is attached to it, you want your discussion partner to be shackled by convention, political correctness, and whatever the societal zeitgeist deems to be acceptable TODAY. It will not be a real discussion, but a phony facade.
<comment>
Why would someone even bother calling another person a naughty name on the Internet in 2023? Don't we have bigger fish to fry?
Maybe what I'm disillusioned and disappointed with is how stupid everyone really is. If we didn't suck, we'd do the important things like ensure basic employment, income, and housing, end gerrymandering, make corporations not legally people, and stop killing the planet.
Yes, me included. I can windbag all day about this shit, but it doesn't change anything.
<comment>
eightochan had thread localized post id whic allowed for anonymity, but not in the context of a single thread, allowing for your ideas to be attached to your unique thread local ID but not across the website at large.
It was taken down by the feds because it was too effective at preventing their evil tactics. Post IDs could be easily implemented here but this is a honeypot so they wont be.
<comment>
You're always allowed to use a throwaway name.
<comment>
That's not my point at all. I mean that if someone does that and it upsets you, you were never going to get the honest discussion you wanted from them. And to force them to comply to your standard of what civility just means forcing them to be something they're not.
Find someone else to have a discussion with.
<comment>
Find someone else to have a discussion with.
OK retard.
<comment>
Hey no offense, but you sound like a woman:
Even scientists speak louder to assert their opinion, we can't scream so...
"YOU RETARD MY OPINION IS SUPERIOR TO YOURS" 
And lastly 
Maybe what I'm disillusioned and disappointed with is how stupid everyone really is. If we didn't suck, we'd do the important things like ensure basic employment, income, and housing, end gerrymandering, make corporations not legally people, and stop killing the planet.
Ok bruh, go outside, fight for that, no one is going to resolve world hunger on Facebook, Reddit. You are not changing the world, you are 1 retard in a billion of retards, if you want to change things go outside and talk to real people, not online.
That's why RETARD, no one sucks except you, if you want to talk we are here to listen and give you what we really think, go past the slurs, cause we are friendly mocking you.
<comment>
Do you want a cracker, you absolute parrot? I admitted it already:
Yes, me included. I can windbag all day about this shit, but it doesn't change anything.
<comment>
You: why do these anonymous people not comply to my standard of civil discussion? It must be the anonimity that makes them call me RETARD so we must take it away
me: It's not the anonimity that is the problem here
You: wow RETARD
lol
<comment>
You seem to be upset. If someone does that and it upsets you, you were never going to get the honest discussion you wanted from them. And to force them to comply to your standard of what civility just means forcing them to be something they're not.
<comment>
I'm not forcing anyone, you were, and then failed your own test/standard while tauting yourself as somekind of enlightened internet intellectual. I found that funny, not upsetting.
It was good bait anon, it just took me too long to realise it. I am the retard.
<comment>
My point is that nobody is forcing anyone to be civil. We COULD be having fun and talking about how to end corporate oligarchy, but no.
<comment>
the nastiness isn't the problem because that's people showing you the ugly side they don't want you to see in public, the issue is disinformation because there is no accountability
<comment>
We're only here to shed an unfiltered lens on society.
that's not necessarily a good thing
<comment>
What bruh? Then start talking about it??? 
This is you:
Ah I really want to talk about cumming in girls :( but everytime someone comes and says nigger cum in girls and not me :(
What are you opinions? Say them.
<comment>
freedom to shart in the mart
<comment>
Why can't 4chan pass laws?
<comment>
Honestly it's stupid to have intellectual conversations like 99% of the time. Definitely online. You're better off sticking to studying, improving and reading books by famous authors, which can almost satisfy the same itch. If you want a sort of news/info source as it were find it elsewhere. A conversation only works when you both know a lot and are both working off of each other which is rare, the vast majority aren't worth talking to, even in academia people don't know anything and even at the highest rungs someone is usually better than the other. If you want that 1% find people irl (at a university) and the relationship will be more satisfying for you anyways. I find for me it's gone the other way more often: my desire to have a serious conversation has affected my ability to have casual or silly conversations. Better to treat things stupidly most of the time and keeping to yourself.
<comment>
I think people legit get mad at me when I try to infuse conversations with substance.
Definitely agree with you.
<comment>
And your always allowed to impersonate that name and destroy it. Post id's were locked to a user per thread and unable to be fudged or imitated. So many retards were humiliated by same fagging and getting called out and it was hilarious every time. Deceptive people can get fucked. The truth shines on eternal
<comment>
Not true, a conversation with someone more knowledgeable than you can lead to discovering new material that you would have no idea relates to your interests without someone mentioning it to you.
<comment>
I cant find intellectual discussion partners anywhere
I know the feel. A big part of the problem is, that intellectuals have proven to be major idiots in the last years. The dumbest opinions came from the "experts", journalists, academics and politicians. Of course much of it was larp, but corruption is even worse than stupidity.
The only people now, who have something real to say, are seen as total loony, like David Icke. So I have basically no one to talk about the real world. Not even /x/ is an interesting place any more, as people there just want to preach their sermons, or ask how to get rich through magic. 
The culture has reached a dead end. Wisdom is dying or will probably have to go underground to survive. In public it doesn't even need censorship and canceling, because reason is drowning in an ocean of stupidity and propaganda.
<comment>
your always allowed to impersonate that name and destroy it
That's part of the fun, and why tripcodes exist.
<comment>
Your image while accurate forgot one of the biggest uses of computing, porn.
<comment>
I will resist
calling anyone you don't like niggers trannies or jews (likely all 3) is not resisting bro.
<comment>
I love 4chan precisely because whenever I make a stupid comment (because of a faulty perspective and understanding) I immediately get viciously trolled/insulted/humiliated. It's caused me to think clearer than before. This site is like communicating with the collective id. I need instant vicious feedback to wipe out any of my faggoty weak thoughts.
<comment>
took 35 years to figure out popular internet is not fit for intelligent discourse
Damn dude, read a book.
<comment>
Start by not taking it to r9k for one and if it's really a problem get the fuck off 4chan. But no you felt the need to bitch about it on here then have the audacity to complain about the maturity levels. Might be time to take a look in the mirror pal.
<comment>
Use sites like this, and other social experiences to filter for people who you believe are capable of those conversations. Then, make an attempt. If it works, great. If not? Keep trying. Your pool of desired candidates is likely very small, as I'm assuming you want to talk to other smart people with similar interests, which will take time. I can guarantee they are out there, but they are often busy doing important shit, and are difficult to summon. Another person very similar to you tried this tactic on me. I am not a physicist however, but we're still friends, and talk about other exciting topics. Though, if you don't realize the importance of privacy and anonymity, this is probably larp. 
Good point. You see a lot more dumb shit because the general public has access to what used to be a walled garden.
I've literally been on discussion boards for over 20 years and it's like I'm having the same arguments over and over,
I'm having the same arguments over and over
I thought it was pretty common knowledge that internet arguments are pointless. Do you willingly engage in these arguments or just find yourself in them?
<comment>
What do when the people calling you a faggot have actually had buttsex with men?
<comment>
The anonymity cures like 90% of my social interest.
Everywhere else: Fuck up, get banned, never learn.
Here: Fuck up, get called retard, can try again and learn.
repeat over years and years and through brute force, im not that retarded anymore. I even have a few friends irl now.

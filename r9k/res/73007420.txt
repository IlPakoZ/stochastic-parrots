I have fucking rats in my kitchen. I found a roll of paper towels stored at the back of the under the sink cabinet chewed up with little brown pellets around it. I'm so fucking pissed that these little jews are living under my sink that I set up two mouse traps with the highest quality cheddar cheese I could buy.
I hope their spine gets snapped in half.
Probably just mice, no?
Rats are a whole different level.
Probably mice in all honesty, but they are a vermin that must be exterminated. I have yet to see one yet however.

They are sneaky little cunts.
Used to have some at my previous house, little cunts would start playing around in my bedroom and hit the computer case in the middle of the night.
If you have the gumption to finish them off, I had the most success with glue traps. Just try to not let the little shits suffer too much, they'll gnaw their legs off trying to escape.

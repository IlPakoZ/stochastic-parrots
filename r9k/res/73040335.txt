I don't care if the people support BLM or socialism or whatever as long as they're homophobic, that's the important part. Like the people haven't changed their thoughts on homos since the 80s and see them as freaks, and you can freely call someone a fag there. Any place like that in the land of Uncle Sam?
San Francisco CA
Imagine getting mad about fags but being okay with niggers. I'd rather live in a giant fucking rainbow house on Faggot St than be anywhere near a fucking shitskinned ape. Most niggers are sort of gay anyway; they fuck each other in prison as soon as possible.
Literally any poor black neighborhood would let you talk shit on gays. 
They are also very big into blm and gibs. 
Thread solved.
Op is actually gay and into niggers
my house for sure
Was just going to say this too. The entire movement probably started over there and it's very much friendly towards the community

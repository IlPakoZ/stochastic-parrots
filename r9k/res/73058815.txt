Any amazon flex bros in here?
Thinking about starting to make some money on the side.
its mindless work and will make you go fucking crazy if Im being completely honest. Again mindless work scan bag scan bag scan bag scan bag scan bag. Not a lot of socializing except for the initial training (trained with 2 qt 3.14s and a burly fresh out of prison type of guy the trainer switched throughout the 3-4 day training period) you will receive which is great and the flexible schedule is nice as well, sell your soul to the god of the material world if you must.
FlexRT chad here. I've been doordashing in the city on the side. Making around $700/week doing both jobs pretty comfy and low stress.
Amazon flex, idiot. Not the same as working at an amazon warehouse.
Have a friend who works 5 hours a day and makes $800 a week. Obviously after taxes that's probably like $700 but still, seems like easy work.
low stress my ass
Hit and runs have a similar conviction rate to arson. It's very unlikely you'd get caught, even if they found your car it's almost impossible to prove it was you driving.

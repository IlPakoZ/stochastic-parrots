I want to have a relationship with a quirky silly alternative bisexual goth hoe, and they match with me on dating apps, but I don't smoke weed. It gives me panic attacks. Should I kill myself?
Literally exactly what I have+mommy
do you smoke weed? does she? everyone does in 2023, especially the hoes i described. it's over
Yes. Just smoke dumbass what's the problem
"i dont smoke because i already have two spirits inside of my body, but i'll suck Christ's blood while you commune with the weed ghost"

I smoked way too much my first time (because I was already an avid 13 year old nicotine vaper, I knew how to inhale and the joint didn't even make me cough). That was a pretty unpleasant experience that gave me a fear of weed that then ruined all of my experiences after it; and that reinforced the fear. So basically I panic whenever I smoke it
smoke flower, mids. cut it with rolling tobacco. she will laugh at you for being a pussy and you will laugh at her for having daddy issues while calling her "princess". this is the stuff true romance is made of

how do you anons have friends? do you have to put in a lot of thought and effort into what you say and do around friends, or does it all just come naturally? where did you meet those friends? 
i am very close to suicide, i have never really have a friend in my life, i'm turning 29 in a few months and i have spent years and years trying to make people like me enough to want to be friends with me, i have never succeeded, its over 
im just trying to figure out what i have been doing wrong

Start by talking to people about them, keep hanging out at places where they hang out, eventually you bond

If you can't bring drama or can't keep getting involved with drama then you will never belong in the friend group. Gossip is the currency,not just for women.

I'm so fucking lonely
Are you trans

Not op but i've been lifting in the same gym at the same time for almost 10 years and made zero friends despite the fact that all of them go there only to hang out. All of them look exactly the same as the day i started.

That's a gym, you don't make friends at the gym, unless you are gay

Its more luck than anything anon. I was completely alone for 10 years maybe more when randomly I ran into two guys who have now been my best (and only) friends for 5 years now.
do you have to put in a lot of thought and effort into what you say and do around friends
In my experience not really. I just act like a complete idiot and say whatever comes to mind and we have a good time. They're not a real friend unless you can let loose and be yourself around them, trying to fit in and make people like you never gets you friends unfortunately.

You should get them fired from their jobs

idk i have this philosophy in life that good friends just cross paths, for me it has always happened that i coincidentally met my bestest of friends. you probably just have bad luck idk. but yes making friends comes naturally. you can usually make friends either at work or through hobbies and (if necessary) have online friends, suicide isnt an option
<comment>
just out of curiosity what was the coincidence and interaction that got you and your friend talking?
<comment>
well first one is cliche, but it was school
another one was on the bus, this one dude just started talking to me (we are the same age)
another one was that i met him on roblox, yeah, its online, but we have told eachother basically everything about ourselves and he is probably the realest friend i have (but he is online)
another one was suicidal and drunk and started talking to me, and i kept checking up on them every month or so for about a year before they actually started being friends with me (i just wanted to make sure they didnt kill themselves)
these are all REALLY specific, but you get my idea? we just crossed paths one day
<comment>
im glad it happened to you, i never really had any experience like that, it must be nice
<comment>
well, thank you. its just really a massive coincidence really. there was times where i was lonely in life too, many tears were shed but suicide was never the option, you know?

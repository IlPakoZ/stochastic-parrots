Let's say you have a gf. She walks in with her friend dressed like this and tells you they're about to go to the club. What do you do?

Bring them over for a talk and explain to them that I have a white cuck black bull fetish so they can be more open about it with me and promise to send videos of them getting fucked by black guys with degrading texts

tells you they're about to go to the club
First of all "telling" instead of "asking" is the problem number one.
Number two is "club" part
Number three is her friend having no taste
Last (but not the least) is her friend being proud race traitor. And I know damn well she will not rest till she can spread her retardation to someone else (like vegans or ecocultists do). Despite my warning she is still friends with that cunt. And now they all of a sudden are going partying regardless without asking me do go together? Yeah, I know how much is 2 plus 2.
So what do?
Oh course honey, have fun.
The moment they leave, I pack my shit, call friend to get a place to crash for a couple weeks (till I can find new place) and leave keys in a mailbox.
Block her from everything.
She didn't listen when I talked.
Now I won't listen.

Ask her to film her encounters during the night for god-tier fap material.

I don't think you understand how easy you have it. You could easily lose ALL of that if you were waterfasting for a month and 3 days. You just need to require willpower and convince yourself you don't like eating lard anymore.

also you won't get loose skin from that. You have to be morbidly obese. Maybe you'll have a little though its nothing too crazy. they'll go away on their own over time

Lose weight gradually. Do the recomp diet and do diet breaks every once in a while.

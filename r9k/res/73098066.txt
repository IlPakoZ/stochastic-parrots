Lose skin prevents me from losing weight
loose flaps sink ships
you eating too much is preventing you from losing weight
your own attitude prevents you from losing weight you flabby fuck
I don't think you understand how easy you have it. You could easily lose ALL of that if you were waterfasting for a month and 3 days. You just need to require willpower and convince yourself you don't like eating lard anymore.

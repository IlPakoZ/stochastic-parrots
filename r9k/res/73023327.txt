I wonder if my girlfriend having "cool interests" would make her more attractive to me or not.

my girlfriend
Ayy does this mean that you finally manifested yourself a girlfriend? Or do you mean hypothetically?
<comment>
i have the same interests except for
blackgaze
blackgaze is awful and gay. i'm a 6'1 gymcel though, so i'm not a cute girl
<comment>
Oh sorry, yes I did mean hypothetically. You've got me thinking, what kind of celebratory party would I hold here if I finally got myself a girlfriend? I feel like I have an obligation to tell you guys the news if it ever happened.
Lucky anon, YOU get a cuddle shark!

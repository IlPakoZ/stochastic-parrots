attempt to exert autonomy or make my own decisions
"No anon that's a bad idea just keep doing what you're doing right now and you'll be fine"
follow aforementioned advice
"Wow anon you are wasting your best years just doing all this work and boring stuff you're really missing out you need to take some risk and get excitement in your life."
"Anon you need to do this it really is the best thing for you"
"Wow good job anon you really did make the right call, let me spoonfeed you verbal validation for your decision"
"Wow anon if you do that then I don't know how to help you, you'll get nowhere in life doing that."
"No just stay with us anon, it's better and we're always here for you."
"Jesus Christ anon, you need to get some fucking autonomy and direction in your life."
I know they are just trying to help but sometimes I feel like I have no say in the way things are going and everything is so manipulated and preplanned by my parental figures that I have no breathing room
Maybe I'm just misinterpreting their directions or something but my god I have no idea how to break free or do anything right

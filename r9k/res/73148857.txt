I hate how many celebrity names are just stuck in my mind when I don't care about them and have no idea who most of them are or what they look like
Im actually surprised that I know who the actor is, he was in a show a few years back that I found pretty funny, dunno the girl though
I mostly know the face/film they played in, not their name. If Keanu Reeves wasn't so hyped by reddit sois I'd still call him "The guy from Matrix".
I don't watch movies so I don't know most actors
donald trump
keanu reeves
tom holland

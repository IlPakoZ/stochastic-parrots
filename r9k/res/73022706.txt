Does anyone else get insanely weirded out by business/ corporate culture? The entire thing gives me the creeps. I understand that sometimes you want to be impersonal in interactions but I work for some people who are like this 24/7. They are just complete drones whose entire lives revolve around this curated image to generate a higher bottom line. They even go as far to send out these emails about how we need to cut down power usage at work and then begin sending responses back in the shared email saying "thankyou. What a great reminder"

I wouldn't want to be like that for my whole life 24/7, but I definitely get wanting to be like that at work. I want to be polite, businesslike, and completely impersonal with coworkers. You aren't my friend, I just work with you.

Hey OP, I think we ought to huddle up and rapidiously communicate superior "outside the box" thinking that can generate enthusiastically benchmark enabled systems that will help maintain mission critical niche markets.
Don't be late for tommorow's meeting.

"thankyou. What a great reminder"
Yeah, I don't do that shit at least. In general that's just the shit you gotta eat though.
I got vertigo reading this post.

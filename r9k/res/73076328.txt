i like his video's but they irrationally piss me off sometimes. what do expect from fast food? you get it when you want something easy and gross to eat. of course it's not that good.

Don't watch them then you retardbrained zoomer. You don't have to watch every piece of shit content put out on youtube
I like his older stuff but Josh is bae &lt;3
I like his videos too, but he can be a bit of a condescending snob sometimes
Andy Cooks is better anyway. Funnier too
If you want to watch a real condescending snob search for that Italian retard who criticized the way Gordon Ramsay makes carbonara
That Italian is right, Gordon should pull his head out of his ass and not call that shit Carbonara
That guy was retarded and tried to milk views in the most cringe way possible. I don't like Gordon Ramsay either but I don't understand all the gatekeeping of Italians on food. I am Greek and I've seen all kinds of people buttfucking "traditional greek recipes". I just don't care.
His delivery is the worst thing imaginable. It's actually an art, he has absolutely no humility and is instantly annoying. And you know what else fucking sucks? His B roll.

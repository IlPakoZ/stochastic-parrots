i like his video's but they irrationally piss me off sometimes. what do expect from fast food? you get it when you want something easy and gross to eat. of course it's not that good.

If you want to watch a real condescending snob search for that Italian retard who criticized the way Gordon Ramsay makes carbonara

That Italian is right, Gordon should pull his head out of his ass and not call that shit Carbonara

That guy was retarded and tried to milk views in the most cringe way possible. I don't like Gordon Ramsay either but I don't understand all the gatekeeping of Italians on food. I am Greek and I've seen all kinds of people buttfucking "traditional greek recipes". I just don't care.

His delivery is the worst thing imaginable. It's actually an art, he has absolutely no humility and is instantly annoying. And you know what else fucking sucks? His B roll.

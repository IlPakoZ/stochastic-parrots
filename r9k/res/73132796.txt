Sex is a liberating experience that's why people who regularly partake in it discard extreme religious and ideological views.
And you are denied sex that's why you have the beliefs that you do. Don't try to convince me you're celibate based on you conviction to your beliefs, we all know that is a lie. Ever since puberty you wanted to have sex with an erotic and lustful woman and now you can't so you hold onto your extreme beliefs as a form of novelty or authenticity.
Have Sex, incel.
So, I'm definitely not a feminist, but you know those radfems who say shit like "all heterosexual sex is rape" or whatever? Like Andrea Dworkin types? Well, they're not right, but they are kind of approaching the ballpark of right if you narrow down 'sex' to 'sex outside of a long term committed relationship.' There is always the possibility that someone is being violated in some way in a casual sexual encounter because there is always the possibility that one of them thought it was a relationship. Many courts have ruled that 'rape by fraud' (like impersonating someone to get laid) is actual rape and there is something very close to that potentially under the surface in any sexual encounter that's not explicitly part of a long term relationship. One person 'faking feelings' to get the other to have sex; that's fraud, and fraudently obtained sex is rape.
I'm not saying you're wrong, But it's not like you can just walk out in the middle of the street And find a willing partner. Especially not an attractive partner.

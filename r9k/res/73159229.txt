What's the correct process of getting out of the doomer bullshit rut.
Do fun things first, or hard things that need to be done?
I always procrastinate on the hard things.
And end up doing nothing the whole day anyway.
Eating the frog first simply just makes me do nothing.
Any advice improoooooovers?

Pick a time to get started on the thing. Do it for as long as you can, then take a short (&lt;5 minutes) break and start again. You can stop for the day once you are at least 80% finished. 
Getting some work done is far better than doing absolutely nothing.

Do you do cardio? I'm not sure why but for me personally doing hard cardio helps me with motivation.

I like splitting my tasks into tinier tasks and doing those. The super tiny tasks are so small, pretty much have no excuse not to do them. I read Atomic Habits so I'm supposed to be an expert on them by now!

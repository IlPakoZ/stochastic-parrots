When she lampshaded her shitty mood/manic episode again she was saying something to the effect of "Maybe i need to take a walk or have some sex"
So yeah, there's a 70%+ chance she's going to cheat on me with some random chad in her cunt behind me back i fink 
I hope she's not stupid enough to openly tell me this, that would be the red line. I'm not going to become a literal cuck for her bipolar shit lmao
Also, the "sexual risk-taking behaviour" fits in perfectly with her letting herself get shagged on the first date by me too (without condor no less)
<comment>
"she's a slut cause she slept with me"
<comment>
Ah yes fucking great
If she's on BPD meds without telling me then that explains her fertility issues too i guess
It's all starting to lowkey cum together now innit
<comment>

If he wants (You)s so badly he should really try talking shit about Nigella Lawson or something, should've learned by now that none of us really care much about the royals. Americans always treat is as some kind of gotcha.

You should go out with your mates tomorrow, have some drinks, maybe get a bag, destroy some relationships by confusing your crushing misery and loneliness for homesexuality. What's the worst that could happen?

<comment>
Brits. I have an honest question for you: how do you put up with all the insane shit your government does to you?
I thought Biden was bad, but whenever I'm having a bad day I just take a look at what's happening across the pond to realize that my life could be way, way fucking worse. Honestly. How do you put up with it? 
I've seen some of the most insane, dystopian shit come out of the UK. Hands down. And I never hear about any resistance to any of it. wtf if going on over there?
<comment>
Sure is lid. Something about L signs from ASMR Goddesses just hit differently.

She calls herself 'Empress' as well which intrigued me...
<comment>
the vagueness is an issue, they can push anything through courts and set precedent. same with the posturing about end to end encryption
<comment>
So this is how you put up with it,
Ignorance is bliss I guess. And so is comfort, and death. 
Hope everything gets better of there, got my hands full here so all I can do is watch
<comment>
Timestamp? I ain't watching all that de lid.
<comment>
So this is how you put up with it,
The government couldn't afford the .txt document that bill was drafted on. It'll pass but nobody will be hired to sift through literal billions of webpages, they will offshore it to some Indian office who will ban Facebook twice a day and some tory donor suddenly gets a new yacht
Nothing changes.

If you were in a car park one day, and accidentally reversed into someones car, then quickly drove off in the heat of the moment, you'd be panicking for weeks. Constantly worrying about CCTV, thinking if anyone saw your numberplate, anxious waiting for an NIP or the police to come knocking.
If you accidentally hit and killed a cyclist on a remote country lane, the gravity of the situation would be so extreme, your brain wouldn't process it and you wouldn't have a care in the world

She's ""thanked me for my patience"" like almost a dozen times now too, that's the kicker here.
Like, that's about all she does. "Thanking me" and then promptly proceeding to write some bullshit evasive low-effort one-liner responses that aren't even really saying anything of substance 
It's fucking bizarre, and i truly don't know what her endgame is here with this shit she keeps pulling (if there even is one)
Essentially told her now to finally stop projecting all her shit on to me ("hurr you must be hiding something from me, but i still won't be elaborating the actual thought process behind my irrational paranoia"), come clean and get herself checked out at a shrink for her unstable moods and nervous breakdowns if she hasn't done so already. 
Otherwise the whole thing is pretty much fucking pointless since it always runs in these same predictable (and frankly tiring) bullshit vicious cycles with her bipolar ass

the UK is maximum fucked, even more fucked than most other european shitholes
full blown anarcho-tyranny, anarcho because the criminals can rape and murder as much as they want but if you defend yourself with a towel after someone breaks into your home and rapes your unborn daughter through the pussy of your wife with a red-hot bar of metal youll be jailed for life and have your feet cut off

It's full to the brim and the people are rude, selfish, and unkind. The weather sucks, and the cities are absolutely grim. The countryside looks nice but is a theme park for tourists and is expensive as hell. At least in places like the US or Romania, the countryside is pure and authentic, and people are genuine there. Wanting to move to the UK now is like wanting to move to Rome in 500AD.

That's retatded, it's the opposite. Tourists go to the city so they can go shopping, get drunk and do other city shit
Only 7% of this country's land area is considered urban, buiilt-on-land. The idea that the remaining 93% is a tourist hotspot is really stupid.

No you're supposed to say something to make me feel bad.
<comment>
I liked it when you said you bought bacon from Curtis'
<comment>
It depends, why are they fat? A few fat women are alright to shag, but some have a lot of other issues. The sort of woman who ends up fat tends to be the sort of woman who is grossly unattractive in other ways
<comment>
100 percent a lot of fat birds now are fucking gay

TFW living life by the Seaside Doctrine.
TFW you're gamble free.
TFW you're always on a fresh start.
TFW you're having a few swift little halves.
TFW you're walking to the local cafe for a comfy trekkie brekkie
TFW you're grafting fucking hard in voluntary work.
TFW you're having bacon buppy times and creamcake times when they're well deserved.
TFW there's no point sitting inside sad loneley and depressed.
TFW you go and dance your heart out in the woods just like are Mark does.
TFW you feel alot better when you've gone out and done some new skills and work experience.
TFW you get confidence and feel better because you're grafting hard in voluntary work.
TFW you've gone years and years without employment until you learnt the Seaside Way.
TFW life is so good when you don't gamble.
TFW you dont want it to be October yet, you want to enjoy the summer forever like our Mark says
Just love him so much lads. Whoever introduced us to SeasideMark is a hero. What a fucking experience. He's older and wiser than most of the NEET's here. He's an ancient wise NEET and I hope I get top rate PIP like him one day
It's a lovely. 
Cheers xxxxxxxx

early 20s zoomer
go touch grass in london
90% of people at events are 27+
this is for 'cool' 'young people' stuff too, not generic meetup.com normie stuff
is this a london thing or are all big cities around the world like this? i was gonna try and move somewhere with more zoomers but if this is everywhere i'll just stay here
i tried to talk to some very nice zoomer ladies outside this pub the other day but i was very sweaty due to coming out from a punk gig on the other side of the road and didn't want to miss the last band so yeah we didn't get with them this time

lost a cheque earlier
had it in my back pocket
walked to town to pay it in
it's not there when I reach the bank
not on the ground anywhere
I have no idea how it went missing. It wasn't visible, it was deep in my pocket, but somehow it's vanished. 
It was from my gran, and I really don't want to worry her by telling her the thing has gone missing. PLus I'll get the rest of my family on my case for losing it
<comment>
Kys spam mong cheers
<comment>
Was there anything else in the pocket?
I lost 30 pound when I foolishly put it in the same pocket as my phone, then took the phone out.
<comment>
Iooks like advertising desu desu
<comment>
guess what lads 
my knob is aforementioned out 
As you were
<comment>
nope
just an envelope with the cheque
I'm not entirely bothered about the money desu, just don't want it being found out what happened
<comment>
spam mong is so grim in the naze
<comment>
Why not just say youre a bachelor. Its gay as fuck to think about how others will percieve your sexuality. Im straight and never considered getting a partner to 'be normal'. It seems normies cant live without being in a relationship and others knowing the fact.
<comment>
Probably alright to just quietly let it go, your gran probably won't notice it hasn't gone out of her account, nobody can pay it in or cash it so it'll end up in the bin somewhere. Fuhgeddaboutit
<comment>
Nobody could do anything with it, other than cash it for you. Would be extremely unfortunate if a member of your family found it.
<comment>
Not everyone is gay like zoomers. They couldn't just say they loved cock back in the day. Most probably wouldn't admit it now.
<comment>
thanks anons
I'll have a few pints and forget
<comment>
I got a laptop off eBay last week and I've been looking into a multi-sim kind of deal for both my laptop and phone. Any recs? So far three seems to be the best choice, with their business plan.

<comment>

<comment>
Can you imagine the mentality it takes to do that and these lads wonder why they have no friends, why no one likes them. The give off I'm a pathetic child vibes to everyone.
<comment>
Nice edit photoshop lid

You must be retarded if you think it's all one poster.
<comment>
If your life is so shit that you have to find a moment of escape by imagining people have it worse than you, your life is fucking shit. 
I have never thought "oh well, I could be someone else". Thats loser talk. My life will never get so bad that I want to escape my body like you
<comment>

There will never be a fresh start
<comment>
There will never be a fresh start
Not with that attitude de lid. You have to stay positive in life. There's always someone worse off than you x
<comment>
There's always someone worse off than you x
That's not positive at all. You're trying to enable your poor behaviour by using other people as a scapegoat. Its classic depression addict behaviour and with that mindset you wont change.

Fast as the wind, the invasion has begun
Shaking the ground with the force of thousand guns
First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way
Leading the way
Charging the lines with the force of a furious storm
Fast as the lighting phantoms swarm
Two hundred miles at nightfall
Taken within a day
Thus earning their name
Earning the fame
They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Living or dead, always ahead, fed by your dread
Always ahead, as the blitzkrieg rages on
Breaking morale with the the sound of blazing guns
First in the line of fire
First into hostile land
Tanks leading the way
Leading the way
Leaving a trail of destruction to a foreign land (waging war with conviction)
Massive assault made to serve the Nazi plan (Wehrmacht's pride, ghost division)
Communication's broken
Phantom's are far away
Thus earning their name
Earning the fame
They are the panzer elite, born to compete, never retreat (ghost division)
Living or dead, always ahead, fed by your dread

There's a metric SHITTON of SEA wahminoids i've been matching with again

big gay African men
<comment>
Been to Africa once, didn't enjoy it
<comment>
Was it because of all the big gays?
<comment>
I've also been to London and wouldn't recommend it.
<comment>
Unironically it was because of the Africans.
Also I got food poisoning the day I was leaving, had a horrid flight and then shat myself when I got home

23 hour thread. Remember when britfeel was bouncing on the weekends.
<comment>
Britfeel is dying waheeeey. Let's all have a party now that Britfeel is fucking dead waheeeey!!!!
<comment>
Just us idiots left waving as everyone leaves.
/britfeel/ is dying
/britfeel is dead
Ask me how I know you're retarded.
<comment>
You don't need to be asked. Anyone can take one look at me and know that I am a retard. One look is all you will need, trust me. Go ahead and look. Go for it. It's just us two on the thread right now.
<comment>
I shouldn't have been mean. I am also retard.
Sorry.
<comment>
It really is just the two of us in the thread right now, we should be nice to each other. What would you like to discuss?
<comment>
I can't really hold a conversation. I'm fairly low IQ, calling myself a retard wasn't fair, I'm actually a pleb.
<comment>
Well then I guess we'll just let britfeel die then. Good riddance.
<comment>
Just bought meself a few new t shirts if that's alright with you de lids. Better than giving it to the wookies and wokey wealers.

Why did you stand up and bellow 'I'm Poley' in a crowded pub
<comment>
Literally no-one cares 
Not us, not your spastic football team, not your ugly mother, no-one
<comment>
In my mind int/brit/ and brit/pol/ will absolutely survive until the very last day of 4chan, whenever that might be. /britfeel/ however really has a realistic chance of dying before then, it's still in the balance though. We may suddenly get a wave of new blood in 2023/2024 that keeps it going forever. We already had FBR as a new addition for 2022

What a catch....

Alright there's been enough britfeel slander for one thread. Any one of you fucker's want to take this outside then let's fucking go for it de lads.
<comment>
Can't say there is anyone who has ever riled me up so much that I'd mock their mum on /britfeel/ desu.

Won't be watching the final. I supported Si and he lost
<comment>
supported Si
was so happy seeing the bug get squashed
<comment>
/britfeel/ will become a thread that lasts 5 or more days, 10 posters but the bulk of the posts will be by 4 posters posting their gimmicks and trying to rile each other up.
<comment>
Ordered a chicken tikka wizza if that's alright with you de lids. So I'm doing alright there de lids.

Thursday we had the longest thread ever, at almost 32 hours.

I'm set to inherit 17 million pounds in a few weeks. I know that logically there is no reason everything won't run as smoothly as I'm predicating, but as it stands I'm still as penny pinching as ever. Until it's in the bank I won't comprehend it being real. Do get tempted to by a new car I've seen, but can't bring myself to do it until the money is in the bank

Love is real, but it is something beyond this world. God is Love, and Love is God. It is the primordial vibration from which physical reality is manifested, and the essence of the soul. Most have forgotten this love once they come to Earth in human form, but more are waking up to it while still embodied, whether through deep meditation, crystal bowl sound baths, binaural frequencies, psychedelics, sensory deprivation chambers, lucid dreaming or astral projection. It is the destiny of mankind to bring in this pure unconditional love from the aetherial realms into our present time-space reality as we collectively shift into the 5th dimension. The autistic starseeds among us are here for a very special purpose, we are awakening to this divine love and anchoring it within the planetary consciousness.

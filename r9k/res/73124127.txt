Emmett till is a rapist and nigger. If the white bitch is in hell, I can't imagine what Mr. Nigger is
<comment>
I really have no idea of who emett is

She seems to have regretted her actions, I was hoping that she would come forward and give a speech on why racism is wrong. She could have done some good in her last days, it's a shame she chose to remain quiet.

The way this kid died was fucking barbaric. Like, even for someone who might've groped a woman it was cruel. And people have the gall to say white people are empathetic

they are unironically hateful. like some nigger might say stuff like "fuck wypipo" to vent but whites will happily organize for genocide if they have they opportunity. it's a lot deeper and serious from their side.

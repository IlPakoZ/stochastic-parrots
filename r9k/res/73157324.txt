There is literally nothing hotter than monkey branching.
be me
23 year old femanon
two years ago, I left my boyfriend of three years for another guy
now I'm about to leave the new guy for someone else
Mentally ill and femanon go hand in hand like a hand and a glove
What happens when the branch snaps and you turn around and there's no more trees to climb?
There's always gonna be more trees lmao they're completely expandable
She'll be 30 and childless with no dating options and blame all the men of the world by that point, and thats in the future who would care about that?
Another BPD whore so satisfied with her relationships she can't help begging for more attention here. It's an interesting larp at least.
so basically you start relationships to plan for failure? lol what a basket case
Basically women refuse to ever be alone, to the point where theyll be with someone they know from the getgo theyll leave the second someone even .01% shows even a modicum of interest
upload a photograph of your hand to prove you're a femanon
no dating options
Lol, not possible unless she becomes horrendously deformed.
They're far more likely to give a vocaroo of them reading post number if they're actually a woman, but OP is obviously LARPing.
True, but their dating options rapidly dwindle and degrade in value exponentially from 30 onwards. But yeah theres always some retard simp somewhere willing to shell up money and dignity for the chance at reproducing

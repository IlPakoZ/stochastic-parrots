parents found out Ive been spending all my money on lottery tickets and scratch cards 
my dad said Im stupid
You kinda are. Could've put that money in more useful ventures. Could've fed Chat GPT4 some data, and you might've gotten some profit.
The thing with chatgpt ideas is that you still need to sell your product. The hard part is actually talking to people
Just keep it under control, like once a month or go for smaller forms of gambling.
Sell milk or water instead.
The lottery is all I care about now

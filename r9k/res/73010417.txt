if you died today, how many people would attend your funeral?
0 because I am in the US and this is not my home country. I don't know how corpses are handled here, pretty sure it would end up together with the everyday garbage of other people. I wonder how many days will pass until my family notice anything.
one. I'd be there
Depends on if the funeral was had in this state or the state where the bulk of my family live.
Maybe 20 people down here and 50 people up there.
16 precisely

Outside of family, three people. My one friend and his parents. Nobody else gives a fuck whether I live or die. Hell, my family would probably find my death a relief.

I don't have goals for the week
I just do whatever I want whenever I want
this is a good thread idea, sadly it probably won't get much traction. I don't really have an organized list, but I hope to practice guitar at least an hour a day like the last few weeks. I'm new to it and am following a list of lessons from this guy: https://www.ebooks4guitar.com/months/month01.htm
im guessing your project is the equivalent of my hobby for learning the instrument? it really doesn't cost much to own one and if you have an interest in music, I highly encourage you to give it a shot. so far it's left me feeling very satisfied once i get a chord down and play a song decently.

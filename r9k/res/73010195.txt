Its time for a robot friendly environment. Its time american infrastructure became less car centric.

What about everyone on motorbikes like in Thailand
<comment>
I hope this will happen. But it never will.
<comment>
Also public transit is almost never full like in your webm

Buses suck, they smell you can be robbed and they're unreliable

robot friendly
That would mean an even bigger distance than cars, invasive collusion of personal space is totally offlimits.
How about private jets on NEETbux, maybe?

They only suck when you're riding a bus in a retard neighborhood. Ever ride a bus in a rich neighborhood? No crime. No smell. Great.

Why would a rich person want to ride a bus?

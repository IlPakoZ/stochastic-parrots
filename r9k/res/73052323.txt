college language course
almost all girls
none want to do the speaking exercises with me
they have no problem with the fat body odor guy
is it over with me?
if you have lower smv than a fat guy then it's beyond over, he should be treated like a ghost too
IDK some women like fat guys, or at least don't mind being friends with them if they seem like a decent enough person. Maybe its the way you act in your course? The shallow attitude comes off, doesnt matter if you think you hide it, people can smell pride.
I can barely keep my spaghetti
Keeping your spaghetti is a catch22. I used to spill mine all the time until I got laid. Now I rarely spill anymore. The solution: have sex. Unironic
Same here. As an incel I do believe in the blackpill as a general principle. But all the time I see these other guys who I should objectively mog (ie, shorter, fatter, or uglier than me), and still they have gfs or interact with girls. It is a little too common to be considered an "exception to the rule" desu.
And I do understand that my personality/non-neurotypical status factors into it, maybe the fact that I am an autist prevents me from having what these other guys have. But I will never know for sure I guess.
when was the last time you told a joke irl and made another person laugh
you're love-shy
I think I could be convinced of this but that wouldn't explain the many times (online and IRL) that I have been rejected.
Maybe you're such a hottie that you intimidate them?
yeah I sometimes wonder if this is true

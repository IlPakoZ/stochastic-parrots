Today, so soon after a day of celebration of his existence, marks a day of mourning. 24 years ago, Eric was taken from this world. Just shortly after his birthday, which I celebrated with you all prior, he then was taken from us, from me, from this world. I was but a mere toddler, whose heart could not yet know the ache of loss. Living in ignorant bliss of what my life on this earth had been robbed of. Why even live. Look at him, how precious and youthful he is.
Rest in peace angel. Gone but not forgotten.

You should pull a Sol Pais and join him, anon

Why do you miss him anon

they're probably trolling but columbine really was a tragedy. both he and dylan could have lived great lives in another universe, they were intelligent and interesting people. it's unfortunate the loss of their lives did jackshit to change the way society treats people they deem "weird". you can try to ban guns but the best way to prevent school shootings is to treat people who are different with basic respect and kindness. 
t. was almost arrested for planning something in high school

Why do you wish for my death anon
Why do you miss him
How could I not? Eric was literally perfect in every conceivable way. 
On the other hand, it's a painful sort of perfection because it is so limited, there is only such a short time a boy can be an 18 year old high schooler. In a way, his death as it was the only way to end his life perfectly, but it is tragic all the same. 
I know there was never a chance anyway, especially as we were born so far apart, but his death is a mere reminder that I will NEVER have an aggressive socially troubled emotionally unstable 18 year old high school boy to love and I will carry that woe to my grave. Why even fucking live.

Will continue bumping until midnight to honor best boy.
the loss of their lives did jackshit to change the way society treats people they deem "weird".
I don't think that was their goal, at least not Eric's. He didn't care about how society treated other weird people, just him

Good morning mentally unwell 30 y/o columbiner femanon

Good morning! I hope you are well anon, despite the inherent sadness of this day. How is your day going
<comment>
It's alright. I took some mushrooms this morning for PTSD symptoms, but I accidentally took more than I should have so I feel a bit uncomfortable
<comment>
That does not sound very good for your health friend. Why not go to a doctor and get prescribed anti anxiety medications or just take melatonin or something. Of course some meds are not to be encouraged especially considering the relevancy of that to this thread
Also I did not fully process your original post. Anon I am not 30 years old, although I AM very mentally unwell, but everyone here is mentally unwell

It always makes me chuckle that the threads that have the most non-tranny women are not the "femanon" threads, but the ones hornyposting over school shooters.
OP is a woman (XX) and is insanely horny for teenage boys, specifically Eric. Not much more to it than that.

is insanely horny for teenage boys
This is quite simply a sign of healthy female sexuality. I am very sick and tired of being publicly shamed for something entirely natural. You all simply resent women and seek to create manufactured sense of shame by attacking things that make you most upset, like the fact that women also appreciate youth and most of you are 30+ year olds that can only attract golddiggers with BPD
<comment>
Also
are not the "femanon" threads
These attract troons because they get to feel "validated"
However for us it is extremely obvious to tell which ones are troons and which ones are not, men however seem to have much greater difficulty because you are much less perceptive and do not understand the female experience. We can tell when one is a troon either mtf or ftm

Bitch the problem isn't that women like teenagers it's that they like murderers.

Alhamdulillah, you will one day look God in the face and he will remember your actions in this moment. What can you possibly say for yourself then?
I'm not wasting an Eric or a catboy on you, you get tooth sculpture

That's probably part of it, but it's not just a male thing. Most women are similarly critical of older men that lust over younger women.
Plus I think just seeing people that are old chasing after those considerably younger than them gives off vibes of it being grooming/manipulation.
women also appreciate youth and most of you are 30+ year olds
Bro, I wish more women liked youthful appearences. I'd have way more success with them if that was the case.
However for us it is extremely obvious to tell which ones are troons and which ones are not
Trust me, it's obvious to anyone with a brain 90% of the time. But some people just seem destined to bite any piece of bait they see.

We had guns forever and shit like this is a modern thing
We have a mental health crisis caused by society seeing introversion as an implicit defect and increasingly objectifying both sexes. If women were more naturally aggressive they would probably be doing massacres on a daily basis.

That's because those situations are predatory

They do, you are pursuing normie women because they are more attractive 
the problem isn't that women like teenagers
I am regularly persecuted for shotaposting in other threads.
it's that they like murderers
Which, quite simply put, is the peak expression of masculinity. Of course women will be attracted to that.
<comment>
Pretty much this; schoolkids have had access to guns for ages, and there was basically no school shootings until Columbine. It seems more like you said, an issue with society as a whole. If there weren't guns, it'd just be stabbings instead, like in China where there's an epidemic of mass stabbings.
That's because those situations are predatory
And most people, male and female alike, would probably say that older female/younger male pairings are also predatory. 
They do, you are pursuing normie women because they are more attractive
Even most of the non-normie women I see all want relatively mature-looking masculine men, the few that don't seem more like the exception rather than the rule.

To be fair, that's probably because the shotas/catboys you post in those threads look like really young children. So when you say you're into shota, people are probably assuming you're a full-on cradle-snatcher.

There were plenty,
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States_(before_2000)
They just didn't kill nearly as many people, save for one in the 60s
And most people, male and female alike, would probably say that older female/younger male pairings are also predatory.
Yes, but they would be wrong, normies are retarded and you should not pay any of their bumbling any mind. 
Even most of the non-normie women I see all want relatively mature-looking masculine men
Explain the craze for boyish/youthful looking kpop stars and teen hearthrobs?
Do you consider Eric to fall into the category you speak of?
the shotas/catboys you post in those threads look like really young children.
Those are meant to be cutesy though, they're not sexualized, I have only posted a few hot shotas

Alas, I have forgotten an image. I am correcting this mistake
<comment>
Dylan and Eric had girlfriends they are not real incels
<comment>
They almost certainly died virgins which is enough for me.
Also it was the 90s, things were easier then, no internet and no tinder etc. A lot of you incels would have gfs if we were living 30 years ago
<comment>
Okay in hindsight I realize some smartass is going to tell me there was internet in the 90s, yes I know, I was more referring to like instagram and twitter so don't start with me

Dude on the left probably cannot help but be effected by societys reaction to him and has a complex inner environment
the manlet looks like he faps to 3dcg loli porn and is a weirdo

Tall guy is impossible to tolerate. He thinks hes really funny when even though hes not. Hes self righteous and posts all over reddit about what its like to be friends with what i presume to be a deformed person for sympathy points. The deformed guy is self aware about his appearance and doesnt expect much from people. Hes grateful to have one friend and is able to look past his flaws. Hes generally a pleasant person to be around but nobody want to talk to him.

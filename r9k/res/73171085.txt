why was everything so much better even 10 years ago. 
everyone dressed better
men were actually men
people were made fun of for being trannies 
people actually went and talked to each other despite having aol and phones and shit
everyone was happier 
the world made more sense 
everyone had friends 
women were less whorish
more people outside
anon I don't think you realize this but 10 years ago it was 2013
eh that was just around the time everything started getting bad it was still alright back then
2013 was the last chill year. 2014-2015 is when shit got worse 
It was 1 year after 2012 and 3 years before 2016

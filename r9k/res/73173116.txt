Fembots, has a guy ever done something or had some trait that made you feel like saying "cum in me right fucking now?"

When I'm ovulating, a guy can hold the door open for me and I'm desiring that he'd rip my clothes off, pin me down and breed me on the spot. I get frustrated and catty since it doesn't happen.
When not ovulating, never that feeling, but sort of similar when getting picked up and carried by a guy.
A guy going on about his actual passions or something he's knowledgeable about can make my knees weak. I was in the audience for my friend's dissertation and I was ready to bend over the table by the end of it, he was able to speak so readily and answer questions in such detail that it just drove me crazy.
fuck off whore, go get raped, kil yourself
Hes 6'6 feet tall and has blue eyes,blonde perfect hair with no balding.pale skin and a good jaw.
Fembots are not real, they don't exist because women cannot be lonely.
If you are a woman reading this, you are not a "fembot" you have never felt loneliness in your entire life. You are a whore, honestly i picture most women who post on this board as literal prostitutes who are bored on their days off. Fuck off, we hate you
When he is tall, handsome, abusive and slightly deranged
when he is nice to me but in a genuinely nice way not like the shallow fake niceness, you know the feel. it hits deep. (i never felt love as a child)
Fembots
Theres no such thing as a female robot. Why do you guys keep acting like there is?
ITT Men pretending to be women
Women don't even get that kind of horny. It's just wishful thinking from guys who haven't had to spend a significant amount of time around women.

Sorry for making this but I thought I saw a similar facial expression

Almost got a dream job but did not pass the final interview
unemployed for almost a year now
I keep getting so close but cant close the deal. Shit is so competitive, you cannot afford to be second place. You have to be the number 1 or have nepotism on your side.

OC is very much appreciated. she is pretty smug lmao. literally me.

never give up anon. if I can bounce back from homelessness, you can find your dream job. the path is thorny but in the end it'll be worth it.

I thought this was the one bro. I did so well on the interview too. I just want to move out and finally start my life.

I don't know why they'd want me
Same reason why some job wants me to interview as an actor while I only have experience as a technician/engineer, tax credits but good luck anyway

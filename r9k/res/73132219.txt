Damn it's true, talking to women gives you an energy boost. I finally got shit done today instead of procrastinating. Does it lose its effect eventually or can I just keep talking to girls to work towards my goals?
Talking to a girl and walking away from it not feeling like a total retard makes you feel confident every single time. Never gets old. Like you are showing off a superpower to small talk them
Wait until you live with one and she never shuts the fuck up. They'll go on a twenty minute monologue as you grunt and hmm and yet she never actually says anything.

navigating the world in a conniving sociopathic aspd is the only way people get to where they need to be in life i have noticed. Its what is actively being rewarded.
you'll get far but for every milestone you'll attract more enemies who want nothing more than to destroy you. down the line you'll meet a bigger sociopath who will ruin your life. going down that road, the gains are immeasurable, but also liable to getting taken away at anytime by all the people you pissed off along the way. some of them will bring friends.
you kind of learn to avoid those people and not aim too high in life.
the higher you aim the more evil and sociopathic people you will come across. you should learn to be content with the little things.
down the line you'll meet a bigger sociopath who will ruin your life.
Something something 48 Laws of Power.
pretty sure that's the first one. yeah it's helpful in corporate environments.
Find a sense of community, wherever you can
this is exactly what im talking about, its about finding angles on people and stepping on necks to get ahead. Its as if im not cut out for alot of these modes of existing and dont care for entertaining them. but with that comes a cost, or it may a be perceived one. Feeling like a lackey in all the circles you engage in.
sure, but with that comes piece. you'll never be at peace climbing the ladder and destroying others.
Yes, you have to deal with the monsters and the bigger ones are really terrifying 
If you want to live a quiet life go for it but you will never get the glory or the villains you attract and you need to choose what you want
bingo. you only have to become like them if you want to play their games. it means you're still caught up in the illusion. look elsewhere. we all die in the end.

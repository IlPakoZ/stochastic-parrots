how do i get me a gf lke this
<comment>
i had a girl like this. she will fuck up your head. not worth in the end
<comment>
as to how, just like with the rest. be good looking and interesting. that type often likes tall lanky pale guys that skateboard and listen to postpunk. you can get by without being tall if youre a dj or something. being into arts helps as well.

r u sure that's a woman
<comment>
This shit is so obnoxious. She is attractive. She does not need to act like a schizophrenic homeless person for attention. This shit is so phony. And the fucking filter and hehe look at my Walkman shit
<comment>

Go back to the year 2003 and insert the correct pass code in the terminal.

your voice still sound like a tranny, dude
<comment>
What the fuck is she doing kek? Jesus... if you want a vain and attention-seeking girlfriend, good for you OP.
I doubt she listens to real post-punk. Probably Lil Peep or whatever horrid music zoomers consider "alternative". The scene is dead.

Thank you for saying this I thought the exact same thing she looks like a basic Stacy who found out leather jackets were trending
<comment>
I want to push her into the train tracks
<comment>
This looks so fucking dumb, wtf is she doing lmfao, this is the most male gazy quirky girl Ive ever seen
<comment>
When she's walking she looks like some unwashed dude
<comment>
her movements are very odd for a woman. she kind of looks like a man in some of those moments. like axl rose or someone adjacent to that

crack cocaine probably

how does anyone take the internet seriously when literal 10 year olds could very well be talking to you right now?
I never take it seriously. At most I'll go 5/10 serious, and that's about as deep as I'll ever go.
I have psyoped well established middle aged married women into having sex with me heres a tip dont trust anybody haha
It's nothing to do with age, really. There are dumbasses of all ages on the internet.
just dont take opinions as gospel. only take information from well-cited sources. opinions are just for entertainment and general knowledge on society's viewpoints.
and 10 year olds are usually just playing on their ipad or booting up fortnite to give a fuck about being on a place like this or reddit
yeah it fucking is, do you talk to 8 year olds IRL the same way you do adults? Even if you do your subconscious wouldn't
there are a lot of them on youtube and twitter
They're still able to learn things. Maybe I can teach them something about cultural marxism. The coming generation will be crutial for the fate of the world.
Only terminally online retards on Twitter do. The fact that any of you are most likely goddamn kids might give me some compassion regarding the utter braindead nonsense that gets repeated here day in, day out, but it also makes it impossible to take anything or anyone on the internet even the slightest bit seriously
no i don't take anything seriously
Some adults pass for 8 year olds online.

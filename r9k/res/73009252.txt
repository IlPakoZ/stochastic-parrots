are all cute girls happy?
i feel like i'd be a depressed cute girl
it might be my incel rotten brain
no. i know a lot of cute very sad girls. the thing is they now feel pressured to be something else than cute. in the past being cute made them land the best husband in town and thus the best life, and they were happy. now you got to be something as a woman, and well, some are worthless despite being very cute. men use them as cum dumpsters and pussy trophies for maybe 2 or 3 weeks and thats all. they are consumed in the market sense. they may repeat to themselves the ideologic discourse of being independant and so on. but deep down they know that the abandonment of tradition screwed their lifes. some try to be artist but aren't good enough, and the worst part is they dont even realise inmediately that they are not good, because for a year or so men in positions of power will give them fake oportunities just to approach them, fuck them and then ghost them. they keep losing time, slowly watching their cuteness fade away, as well as their privileges. slowly realising they have actually always been nobody. i do know some girls irl in a deep deep crisis because of this. my catholic side pity and feels sorry for them, while my misogynistic revengeful side rejoices a little bit
why? is it because you are depressed
this is kind of a cope
I wish I was born a beautiful girl. Literally every day I think about this and daydream about it every night while I lie in bed. Whenever I see beautiful women I just think about how much I wish I looked like them. Sometimes I lie in bed for hours daydreaming about my life as a beautiful girl.

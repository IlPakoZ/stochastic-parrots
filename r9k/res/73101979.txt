I am currently writing a story about a scary a ime villain who turns out to be the child of a scientist lady that is affiliated with the main hero team that was forcefully kidnapped as a three year old and genetically aged up into an adult. It will eventually end with them making up. There are moments where he is still terrified and his mom gives him teddy bears to hug. He then talks to her about a bedwetting problem he still has. Chatgpt is helping me write stories for it. Do you think it's going in fetish territory or I shouldn't be worried regarding that?
i love these threads because they always make me feel better about my writing
But it wasn't written by me. It was written by Chatgpt so yeah.
I have more here you guys.
I think I like the way this turned out but that is just what I think.
This one is still my favorite. I love the way it writes what I tell him to write too.

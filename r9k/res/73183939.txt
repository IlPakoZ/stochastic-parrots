You're over 25? Even if you get a gf, she will have had the novelty of genuine romantic love completely worn out of her psychology and cannot give you the intensity she gave to tall handsome abusechad. Date a younger woman? Then you cannot have genuine romantic love because of the age difference making your emotions and minds incompatible for love. You are locked out of the central meaning of life. Love isn't real? Massive sour grapes cope for ugly and short men. It is real and other men live it constantly every day. You cannot and will not access it, though you may eventually trick yourself into thinking you found "love" in a transactional post-25 relationship based on checking off cold calculated life goals like "marry/start family/buy house" that she could and would do with any shmuck that fell for her spiel.
Good luck!

Just date dembots
Even if many arent virgin, most of them have never experienced romantic love by 25 in neither receiving or giving position
<comment>
what is a dembot? Is that a tranny?
<comment>
if it wasn't rape they gave away their most intimate physical action and the peak expression of love to someone else. novelty is what builds bonds and love. first experiences are the only real experiences. there are no firsts to share with women over 25. the ugliest, most autistic women have rich romantic lives with tall handsome men in their teens and early 20s.

So wrong
Love is a connection between two people, thats it and you either feel it or you dont
The only complications arise socially
t. Younger gf haver
<comment>
Nope, that's a cope for having missed out. The connection is a false connection based on dishonesty and refusal to face reality. Your minds are fundamentally noncompatible because what she thinks of as love and what you think of as love as morphed incompatibly by your age difference. 
She is just exercising her old man daddy kink and won't tell you, or if she does tell you that is all the proof that could ever be that is just a fetish for her.

Sounds cute :3
<comment>
I had a gf from 15 to 22
Now I am 26 and she is 19
Its still love anon, let me tell you
On what basis are you so sure its impossible
<comment>
This post reads poorly, I meant I have experienced teenage love before of someone the same age as me and love with an age gap and I dont sense any fundamental difference between the relationships
<comment>
If you were a coomer or porn-addict before your brain matured at age 25 it is forever corrupted and you will never be able to feel "genuine romantic love" for a woman ever either.
<comment>
Oh your mind is warped by young love. Then your brain is just bathing in the permanency of experiencing it when young and you can never assume the perspective of anyone else. You are locked out of the knowledge of how it is impossible after 25, because you are just projecting your previous experience onto your current one. You are essentially raiding this board, it is a board for incels. Nasty attentionwhore cockroach insect turdwhore moron retard.
<comment>
90% of these types of posts are massive copes for genuine character flaws you refuse to work through
<comment>
Only men who are totally rejected by girls and women for genetics of face and height turn to porn. 
Men are capable of loving all women, women are only capable of loving 10% of men.
<comment>
Don't be a narcissist and egoist. You are not better than other people. You are a nasty, ugly souled person trying to punch down. Vile. Vomitous. Rancid.
<comment>
You're right about women over 25, if you want to find love you have to lock a girl down before she is too old or experienced. Idk wtf you're talking about with younger girls though, the primary driver in the difference of perspective on relationships with age is just experience so if you have little to no experience you should be able to connect to a younger 18-20 y/o girl no problem.
Maybe if it is onlyfans but as a woman you shouldn't be dating any guy who spends money on porn.
<comment>
oh well. romantic love is the exception not the norm.
<comment>
I dated a 19 year old at 25 it was fine. She watched all the disney channel shows I did growing up, all the cartoons, nothing crazy different. Also if you think about it add 10 years to both of us and that's fairly normal. People date within that age range all the time. I was her first bf but she was not a virgin sadly
<comment>
Youre a psued
You dont even understand what youre saying
And you cant because youve never been in a relationship
<comment>
nope, it is the norm. women are 50% of population and all experience it, and chad is 10% of men so 5% of population. 55% get romantic love, you are in the short ugly male minority that has to sour grapes rationalize it away.
You are locked out of any perspective but your own because your mind is altered by your routing experience that has taken you down a narrow path. It is as simple as that. Now you seethe and your facade of calm intelligence and genuine interest in discourse falls away because of your shaking seething malding rage.
<comment>
I was her first bf
but she was not a virgin
So basically she was a used up whore even at 19. Having sex outside of being in a relationship is unacceptable and I would never debase myself by dating a girl who did that.
<comment>
Only men who are totally rejected by girls and women for genetics of face and height turn to porn.
Gigantic cope, more than 60% of 11-13 yo boys report having seen pornography at least once at their age. Brain already corrupted before puberty even started.
<comment>
OP is wrong.... but he's not wrong
<comment>
no it is not just experience. your hormones and priming of the brain and youthfulness of the brain are all responsible for the intensity and depth of romantic love, and they universally and irreversibly dull with age and rapidly so after the mid-20s..
<comment>
refers to le ebin meme "romantic love" as a novelty
destroys his own point
<comment>
Pure delusion, by that logic arent we all locked outside of differing perspectives based on our experience? Or just yours is free for some reason? Stands to reason that somebody who has had multiple relationships probably understands them better than someone with 0
<comment>
OP's comic was obviously drawn by the most seething ricecel to ever exist, I just can't stop smirking.
<comment>
girls reject boys starting in preschool and thats when all social groups form. they pick the ugly scrawny boys and help the boys who will grow tall and handsome bully them and exclude them. simple as. 11-13 is no surprise, girls have long started worshipping abusechad by that age.
<comment>
You're a delusionnal sperg and this is why people picked on you in preschool.
<comment>
a person who has not been locked into a path is not locked into a path, simple as.
naive experiences grant no understanding, they just instill operant conditioning. its like saying women can you tell about the biochemical genetics of the x-chromosome because they were born as women. pure nonsense. complete drivel. they dont have biochemical knowledge because of their experiences.
its more like a dog being trained. you are able to perform the fetch trick as it pertains to women, but you have no comprehension of the mechanics behind it. for that, you must look in from the outisde.
<comment>
You missed the point of the comic. The point is that they are protesting saying all lives have value but in their private life they engage in eugenics via their mate choice. That's why she says she is skipping anthro and evolution.
<comment>
you are a case in point, bimbo. seethe mald cope dilate and touch grass.
<comment>
Okay, enjoy the pulling of the teeth which is trying to court a virgin. If she's still a virgin at 19/20 she's most likely extremely sheltered and has overprotective parents so she's scared of the world. Having to show these women that they're their own person and mom doesn't control them is a nightmare just for some sex.
<comment>
I feel more pure love for fictional characters than most women had for their husbands
<comment>
You are a serving of grilled monkfish trying to tell me how forex trading works
<comment>
is you're just looking for "some sex" its no different from prostitution.
you are a seething malding coping dilating turdwhore, touch grass.
<comment>
I'm not even asking for a virgin, I just want her to not have slept around with random dudes she barely knows or given out sex to Chads without requiring any investment from them. Basically just asking for someone who treats sex as something more than just "having fun." I know even that is a huge ask these days though.
<comment>
the comic
if you don't want innocent people to die you MUST be ready to fuck them or else you're a hypocrite because those 2 things are remotely the same
<comment>
we've got a live one boys, a real live malding brainless turdwhore
<comment>
I wasn't planning on making her my gf, we had sex on the first meetup (The texts where pretty sexually charged and we video chatted). She was a pretty cool girl we were a lot a like, I liked hanging out with her it became a relationship... I also liked having sex on tap without worrying about condoms. We eventually bought the worst out of each other, I became fat and timid yet very critical of her, while she became lazy depressed, fat and emotional, that's what happens when you become complacent. Always strive for more bros.
<comment>
remember guys, if she won't fuck on the first meetup she's not really into you. this guys post just admitted that. simple as. do not ever give a woman time of day if she wont take your raw nut load the first time you meet.
<comment>
Geg basically what they're doing is like some psycho who keeps someone in his basement and tortures them but when you accuse the psycho of killing the person they torture they get real defensive.
Well yes I will make their life a living hell and torture them to the point of insanity but I don't think they should die!
Absolutely no one believes you evil witch.
<comment>
OP is a gook
It doesnt get much better than this, boys
<comment>
Oh I was just about to say I was pretty sure the same person made another one just like it. Anyway once again
if you think it's wrong to kill innocent people you MUST be extension be willing to participate in miscegenation or else
Explain this to me. I genuinely want to know how this makes sense to anyone
<comment>
she is even double posting in her rage LMAO
<comment>
We already established this girl was a disgusting whore who was already having casual sex. Yes, if a girl is a whore you should expect sex on the first date and if she doesn't give it then she doesn't like you. If she isn't a whore though she isn't giving sex to anybody.
<comment>
So I should just pollute 10,000+ years of my bloodline for some black/brown/spic guy?
<comment>
I'm currently talking to this cute 18 girl, from what she says she sounds pretty lonely. This might be it if I play my game right. I'm also 24 yo.
<comment>
if she's had sex before and she doesn't put on the first meeting (not first date, first MEETING) she isn't into you. thats what you described, thats what is. no getting around it, you admitted it yourself.
<comment>
your bloodline culminated in being an r9k attentionwhore, it would be upgrade for you to get HIV+ afro sperm in your retard snatch

Btfo by phone poster
<comment>
Why didn't you add gook in there?
<comment>
dont care not enlarging your edited image simple as. 
you were caught out, bimbo
<comment>
lol, did you draw this comic then? The real point is that whoever drew it is buttmad that asian girls go for white guys.
<comment>
That one has nothing to do with race
Anyway answer the question why are you promoting miscegenation. Why on God's green earth would I ruin my ancestral bloodline, especially as a white person.
Maybe I SHOULD start being racist if you all are gonna be like this 
Also yeah same as >>73184345 lmao
<comment>
these woman are clearly shitfaced
drunk women are annoyingly handsy with everybody
<comment>
If white girls won't have sex with me it's the same as torturing me to death in their basement!
Holy fuck you're deranged.
<comment>
Why didn't you add gook in there?
Eh... those kpop-idol-looking boys can get it, those are the only nonwhite men that have permission to be with white women. 
The thing is, whenever a white woman says she likes asian men it inevitably leads to some brown inbred viet kong looking mf thinking that means him
<comment>
drunk women are annoyingly handsy with everybody
I notice they don't get handsy with the asian guys in the vids, lol. Pretty sure no drunk girl ever got "handsy" with you either, or you wouldn't be seething here. Sucks to suck, I guess.
<comment>
They're just bugs covered in plastic surgeries though. I mean, wouldn't that pollute your bloodline? It is miscegnation.
<comment>
Yeah, I would not personally date one, but I'm saying I don't take issue with white women who do. It's 2 good sets genes breeding together, whereas breeding with indians, spics, browns etc is polluting good genes with poor ones.
<comment>
t. guy whos never left his mothers basement past 10:00pm can only extrapolate the world through random youtube vids and thinks its reality
<comment>
You're making a bigger deal about race than the comic is. Race is just one aspect of the eugenics that women are engaging in now days.
<comment>
Good thing I don't want a gf in the first place.
<comment>
Y-you post vids because you've never been out of your mother's basement
Ha ha, this is an imageboard, retard. I post vids to illustrate the point I'm making, which oddly enough is the same point those comics you posted were making. Keep seething, ricecel.
<comment>
There, there.. It's alright.
<comment>
choosing to have sex with people you are attracted to is eugenics
<comment>
getting gf
I dont wanna gf, I just wanna fuck girls and dump them
<comment>
nobody can refute this
every single person is coping
RUTHLESS just be first theory
BRUTAL teen love pill
<comment>
What truly fascinates me is that you're coping to the point where you're projecting your insecure incel fantasies to others, because you think that gaslighting other people's experiences will make your pain go away. It won't. So kys :)
<comment>
As if never being in a relationship and never having sex means your brain is perfectly clean. The second half of your post is pure projection and cope LOL. Your mind is the scarred one.
<comment>
i love how these comics still trigger people to this day
<comment>
How old are these comics?
<comment>
Watching porn isn't comparable to getting fucked by a different guy every week
<comment>
treating your relationships as transactions
Lol sad. I bet you have no kids either.
<comment>
I had teen love. You're not missing out on much pill, honestly. The guys who have watched porn are just as unlikely to have stable marriages.
<comment>
dembots
oh lawd dembots
<comment>
so 99% of men on the planet?
<comment>
Closer to 50%. A lot of people don't wait until marriage.
<comment>
Who even cares about dating when they aren't young anymore? At that point you have a job, a few hobbies and your day is already full, where do you even get the time for girls?
<comment>
Bs, way more than 50 percent of men have watched porn. I've literally never met a man in my life who hasn't.

i only talk to nasty degenerates
yikes. how many of them had kids by age 22?
<comment>
one and he has a really nice family. He's 26 with two young kids and a third on the way.
<comment>
Cause sex with your gf is cheaper and better than nasty hookers?
<comment>
His marriage won't be stable.
<comment>
Never used hookers, never had gf. Idk as an adult you just move on from the things you can never have and do stuff that you actually can achieve. Why even bother with females if you got this far without one?
<comment>
don't care about sex
Being a castrated freak is not part of being an adult. I care about women cause I want to have sex with my own gf who isn't a nasty hooker.
<comment>
This. You can move on from things like your biological purpose and do stuff like paying taxes
<comment>
Biological purpose is procreation, and I am not cruel enough to make my kid live in this shitshow. And without kids sex is just pure hedonism.
Well, I want to explore space and other planets, but I somehow don't seethe about not being able to do so. If you are somehow banned from masturbating - this sucks but whores will help. If you want a non whore - too bad, we are out of stock, as sexual liberation lowered your chances of getting good gf material to nearly zero even if you are young, and for adults choice is non existent.
<comment>
It would be much more cruel to be childless.
<comment>
it's been almost 7 years and his wife adores him as well as the in laws. truth be told, im jealous of the guy though he admits he has days where he misses his freedom. i honestly don't think they will break up ever. the idea of having watched porn ruins a man is pretty unreasonable. if you are into hc or crazy shit, I 100p agree. if cum to woman's asses, tits and pussy you are fine.
<comment>
I'm pretty sure the dude is a troll, hard to believe he really is that stupid. He also shows up in different threads and says the same shit everytime
<comment>
To whom tho? To your parents who weren't even able to raise you properly? To the government that wants more taxes? To your nation that is currently trying to destroy itself?
<comment>
if you actually believe that you're not the BLM sjw the comic is lampooning.

I dont see any problem with this stop being a Misogynist
<comment>
transactional
This is why male loneliness doesn't exist. The ones who are not in relationships don't even understand love.
<comment>
Most men watch porn weekly since they're 11.
You will never be able to know what true and unperverted love is about. It's okay, most men won't either.
<comment>
So are you pocket jerkin while you type out you cuck fantasy?
<comment>
You are 100% right! Everyone 25 or older should just commit suicide.

25 year old boomers BTFO. Some of those NPCs actually never even had sex lmao

Men can seperate lust and love (unlike women)

Men think love is when they watch BBC porn.

Most foids cant even remember their virginity taker

Those aren't men, those are americans.
<comment>
I am 26, which is 4 percent over OPs arbitrary deadline for experiencing proper love with my 20 year old girlfriend. Guess I will have to suicide now.
<comment>
if you actually believe that you're not the BLM sjw the comic is lampooning. 
The comic is literally saying "if you think violence towards and murdering random innocent people of a certain demographic is bad, you have to be willing to have sex with those same groups of people or else you're a hypocrite"

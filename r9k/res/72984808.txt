who watchin jerma rn
snoozefest tier, summit jerma shroud esfand asmongold 
streams you put on to sleep because they have no content to be found
anon what the fuck are you talking about, that was unintelligible
reading comprehension isnt strong with you is it. how about this i would rather watch paint dry than to watch that rapist jerma.
Jerma definitely has schizophrenia and another mental illness and is a test by the government to see if their psychopathic drones will go undetected in the public eye
jerma's funny and all but i find it hard to stomach clips lately that include the chat with how troon infested his community sadly is
I haven't fully watched him since him and star stopped playing tf2. Tried watching his streams but his humor's the same as it was back in 2012, I guess I grew out of it

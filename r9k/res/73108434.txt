reading threads at crystal cafe and lolcow gives you insight into how scatterbrained and bizarre womens brains are. they really are just chad fucking machines with no coherent internal consistency.

Crystal Cafe is fucking disgusting, and I'm considering developing a complex lesbian personality there solely to break the hearts of degenerate, impressionable dyke scum. It seems like a true challenge and a worthy series of (tearful) rewards. Women shouldn't even be allowed basic computer access, let alone knowledge of the internet.

Have fun getting doxxed when the mods don't like you, lmfao. Pic related only got ousted because she posted on lolcow and the mods decided to post her info. 
Don't get me wrong, this cunt absolutely deserved it, but be wary.

no, blocks Tor traffic and I'm not giving them my information.

She was a cow herself though. IIRC she would post about herself in the 3rd person and shit.

I post there weekly, I like the pace but I tend to veer away from societal/dating/sexual discussions.
I like picture sharing threads, music threads, threads about self improvement and sharing good copes.
Sometimes people try to contactfag which makes me not visit that site for a few weeks.
If they kicked me off for being a scrote I'd be sad coz I feel like I fit in, even better than I fit in here. But in reality it never really gets questioned so I feel safe enough to continue sporadically engaging with thoughtful posters.

I really only keep up with the "Terf general" thread, since the roasties there at least dunk on trannies pretty hard and I think that's based.

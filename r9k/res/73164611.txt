Keep doing it. I like reading what you post and then I start to think of what I can post, it's a cycle of posting!!

Only time I talk to people is in the vocaroo threads. I really like talking out loud and I'm so lonely, but speaking to people in person or even on Discord leaves me feeling horrible inside. Vocaroo is somehow impersonal enough to not leave me feeling completely terrible.

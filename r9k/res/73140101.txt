lied about building a wall
he started construction on it and its still being built though
lied about deporting illegals
he blocked the most amount of them from entering the country, more than any other president combined
allowed covid hysteria
he tried to warn you guys but MSM drowned him out
allowed blm riots
blocked by governors from sending in national guard to stop them from happening. none of those were naturally occurring either.
gave pharmaceutical companies money to speed up covid vaccine production
just wanted to end lockdowns asap, but it was a poor decision. there never should have been lockdowns to begin with.

The day I simp for a crooked politician is the day I kill myself as all my integrity would be gone.

He's a weird man, and probably controlled opposition, but I wish him serenity.

what did he do
prevented a lot of illegal immigration and made people start taking the border drug and human trafficking crises seriously
reversed liberal hysteria about white men being racist nazis
worked hard draining the government swamp of corruption for four years

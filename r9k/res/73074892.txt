be me
usual autist
one strange thing though
really don't like board games, like they kind of piss me off and make me uncomfortable
not just actually playing them, but the fact that they exist at all irritates me
I think it's partially because board games are a social activity and I don't like being social
also, adults play them when they're bored, which is stupid because adults should find something constructive to do when they're bored
fuck board games

What is it? I think it's you wanting to play board games with someone. Just go to a game shop during busy hours. You'll find some people. I've seen some pretty autistic people playing at my local place so you'll fit in fine

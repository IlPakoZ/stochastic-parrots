Oh, hey there wagie!
Enjoying you lunch break? Don't mind me, just finishing up my Vocaloid mixtape. I'll be heading out to Subway to get a personalized hand-crafted sandwich made just for ME by a sandwich artist soon. I think I'll take a nap later today and then head to the gym. Napping is good for the brain and sooo refreshing.
Too bad you would get fired for napping on the job! As you know, another day another dollar. Anyway, I need to get back to my music. Toodles!

Making music for my own enjoyment and posting on 4chan is work to wagies now. I've never seen such a bigger cope! Next you'll tell me the leisurely walk in the park I take after lunch is work.
The NEETbux I get is my income wagie. That combined with the inheritance I got, I'll never have to lift a finger in my life! Ah, how comfy it is to be a NEET.
enjoy your $13+tax+tip sandwich moron
I will! Paid for by wageslaves and made by wageslaves just for ME. However, I never tip wagie. If they're lucky I won't make a fuzz while I get my food, since it's one of my many hobbies. But if I do make a big enough scene sometimes I even get it for free! How lucky!
And I'm browsing from the comfort of my own home :^) keep waging and raging.

You'll need to consult the Jews on how far you may walk before Sabbath is broken.

Based NEET, wagies will never know this bliss. I got myself a Carpaccio sandwich handcrafted by a lowly wagie. She was kinda rude so off course i have no tip (wouldnt give one anyway).

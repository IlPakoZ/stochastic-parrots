Is there any job that anyone can get that doesn't involve bullshitting to get in and don't have to act like a slave while doing it?
No. If anyone can do it, then that means it's slave work.
No there isn't. You will always be a slave and take orders from higher ups.
manufacturing or warehouse work is a robots best bet
you dont have to interact with anyone depending on the job, you can just clock in do your slave work and go home and it usually pays more
i work in a plant doing powder coating and all i do is paint parts on a conveyor line and go the fuck home and dont have to talk to anybody, i prefer it to any sort of job involving interaction
the problem is that if anyone can do it then the kind of people who end up doing it are the retards, the below average part of society, and those people need to be driven like fucking robots because they are morons who aren't smart enough to do anyhting more interesting.
think about how stupid the average person is, the people who do these jobs are below that. you don't want to work with them, it's torture.

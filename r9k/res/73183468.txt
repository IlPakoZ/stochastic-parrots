Is it possible to die after consuming more than 25 pills of Tylenol 500mg? Is a peaceful dead if it is taken with sleeping pills? Asking for a friend

obviously it's going to do some pretty serious damage, I don't have to tell you that, but there's probably a reason tylenol overdose isn't a very popular method of suicide. 
your "friend" will probably die over the course of 1 or 2 days which pretty much guarantees he'll be hospitalized either from so-and-so walking in on him or him calling an ambulance himself due to survival instincts.

Anon, first of all, do not kys. It's dumb and pointless
Muh life is dumb and pointless
Yeah and you should live it to spite everyone around you
Secondly. Don't try paracetamol, it is an ineffective and excruciating way to go. Just don't.

What about 50? One if my friends work in a place where girls are accepted if they come from a very bad place, he said that one of them nearly died after consuming more than 20 pills of Tylenol of 500mg 
So I have been wondering, how many pill would you need to die
In Minecraft of course

Someone I know tried this years ago. The hospital literally had posters up saying "do not overdose on paracetamol [the generic form of Tylenol] you will die painfully over 3 days from liver failure".
They had that cos the pills are very easy to get. You will not fall asleep, sleeping pills be damned. Painful liver failure will wake you up and you'll have had time to realise you've made a terrible mistake. Though it might be too late to save you. 
Find something tall and jump off it. Or I dunno, just live. Treat life like you're a tourist. See some sights, amuse yourself, but don't worry because your ticket is limited. You're gonna be dead by the age of 70-something even if you're lucky that way. As they say, "Suicide is a long-term solution to a short-term problem". Shit might get better at some point in the next few decades. Even if it doesn't, though, fuck it. Rebel against meaninglessness. Trapped on a desert island, build a sandcastle. Make friends with a coconut. Do whatever you like, really, you've little to lose. That actually makes you free. Do what you want, at least it won't kill you. You could even just watch loads of TV and post here for the future right now. Nobody's judging you, or nobody important anyway.

Trying to OD in general is one of the best methods for fucking it up and ending up humiliated in the hospital at best and alive but retarded at worst. People are attracted to this romantic image of just going to sleep and never waking up, and it's quite often not that simple.
Tylenol in particular is one of the absolute worst OD choices you can make for reasons mentioned above.
There is one objectively correct method if you don't have a medical professional helping you out and that's a gunshot, preferably a shotgun shell, in the mouth. It's near instant and it's reliable and if you're worried about the mess you inflict it on someone you hate.

drink a blood thinner and jump off a bridge or cut yourself both will work

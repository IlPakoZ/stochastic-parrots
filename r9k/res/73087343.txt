How do you anons break it? 
I've noticed the core demographics of this board is always 19-22, and I feel like that's because after people graduate college and get a fulltime job, they tend to get a social life, and forced structure back in their life again. It's sort of like hs, how are you supposed to shit post at ungodly hours if you have to wake up at 6am no questions asked 5 times a week
I simply shitpost after I come home from work, I have absolutely nothing else, and I'm an insomniac, hence.4:50am post.
It breaks itself when the depression comes back in cycles, and every thing reminding you of pussy, kissing and sex, sends you into a suicidal ideation spiral.
Just back from a 3 week vacation.
Pretty much, and it's not even about work hours and the little time left to shitpost, it's about learning to appreciate that little free time that you get and wasting it in more quality way.

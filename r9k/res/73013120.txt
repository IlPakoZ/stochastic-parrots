Man and woman getting married
Woman let's the man pick the dresses for her bridesmaids
Her friend takes a video wearing wearing what he picked
Why are m*oids like this? You ranr about loyalty and degeneracy and yet this is what you do the second you get the chance?

She wears a bra, problem solved.

Probably downright decent compared to what she wears every Saturday

That's probably fake considering it's TikTok
If I were ever married I'd of course let my wife pick her dress, but I would suggest simple, elegant, and graceful.
Don't really care about the color of it. I think a blue flowy wedding dress would be pretty, with accented red flowers.

Maybe the other bridesmaids aren't tittymonsters.
Otherwise, he's getting married, so he has the ability to pull women, meaning he's normie or chad, which means the higher tier he is, the more opportunity he has to cheat-- Being a high tier male is much like being a woman low tier and above-- you have options, so it's not weird for you to ignore how other people feel.

I received a speedo for me to wear to my buddies wedding because his wife picked it out as the men's outfits. I then recorded a video of myself, wearing the speedo, and uploaded it to shittok. Why do women do this?

its (older) women that spread anti-degeneracy laws
Like always, what women blame for men is usually a women against women (via socioeconomic status and age divide) issue

Why don't you start small with basic small talk and try to develop a friendship?

This is one million percent pure projection.

Pathetic chud always thinks he knows best for everyone. Sort yourself out first and piss off.

Well, why not? The way you worded your post I thought you were Trans too. Maybe be nice to someone different and you could learn something.

They will sort it out themselves eventually. I've seen one detransition and look a lot happier afterward. I've seen one get 15 years in prison. I've seen another decide to *not* chop her balls off and just be happy being fem as possible (she passes really well now, like girl next door look, not bimbo look). Haven't known one personally off themselves, but hey, problem solved. 
Transitioning is transitory. I'd love to see *any* permanent body modification, like gender reassignment surgery, banned. How many regret those surgeries later, like a really shitty tattoo? That kind of shit exists only to enable the mentally ill aspects of those that transition. But there are many reasons that people transition and many kinds of trans people. Those who are motivated by mental illness deserve NO sympathy.

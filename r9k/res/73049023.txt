It is worth noting that the cleanliness of a country or its cities can be influenced by various factors, such as its population density, infrastructure, cultural attitudes towards cleanliness, and government policies on waste management and sanitation. It is also important to remember that different areas within a country can have different levels of cleanliness.
Therefore, if there are specific concerns about cleanliness in certain areas of France, it would be more appropriate to investigate the underlying factors and potential solutions rather than making broad and unsubstantiated claims about the entire country.
Lol.

buspar 
hydroxyzine
the epitome of fake medicines. one literally does nothing and the other is a weak antihistamine, like if you took a benadryl but only a bite of it
weed
coffee
no motivation for anything
take adderall
still no motivation but anxious now
Amisulpride
Sertraline

Pregabalin and promethazine if i need it
Kratom, energy drinks, and dextromethorphan
Coffee in the morning, weed when I feel like doing nothing, baccy in the weed to make it burn smoother, drinking when the boys are up for it or if its been a long day at work, valium to go to sleep

What were your hopes and dreams when you were a little kid and what happened to them?

What were your hopes and dreams when you were a little kid?
Being a physicist or a marine biologist.
What happened to them?
Public school got real fucking bad during middle school and I dropped out. I've been jaded about school and the like for a while but I also just ended up rotting away. Been a NEET ever since.

That my dad would stop hurting my mom and that I would be happy. The first one happened, the second didn't.

I wanted to be the guy who made a breakthrough in nuclear fusion and saved the world.
As I progressed through school I realized I was too dumb and too lazy to ever get good at actual science.
There's a part of me that wants to be a voice actor or an artist, but I never cultivated the skills to be either when I had the chance and I suspect I don't have the patience or passion for doing art (or anything in general).
I settled into a mediocre job in a healthcare related field that I despise, I work part-time now because it's all I can tolerate and when I'm not working I'm drunk.

Gonna give this thread a bump. I'm not about to let it get swallowed up in the BWC vs. JBK shit.

I'm not too sure what I wanted when I was a little kid. The ones my parents wanted me to be were not something I wanted, and I focused on education and had nothing to inspire me. 
What happened to them?
I'm slowly trying to figure out what I personally want. Maybe I could kill myself

I wished i was korean. It never happened.

i never had dreams as a kid
now i have a great job doing something i dont dislike, but my dream is to feel loved one day
<comment>
Everyone around me told me I would be a great man, so I never had a clear dream other than doing what I liked. Reality hit hard at 13 and that's when I had to learn to study. While I did pass secondary school, it wasn't at the same level I started with. Going to uni already, but I really should've taken a pause instead.

didnt have any serious goals other than get rich
i am not rich
<comment>
I guess 99% of my goals was avoiding more foster homes or jail, and going into the military. Honestly people outside of the military are such pieces of trash you have no idea how fucked up and degenerate these pieces of human shit are and they act like they're better than you and you're suppose to owe them for the privilege of having them exist and be a piece of shit.

I never had any. I never thought I will do anything but school/work then read/play at home. I'm an old man now and still don't understand why people want to do anything else.
<comment>
I never had one
Even as a little kid I knew there was something fishy going on in this world
<comment>
Wanted to be a great movie director or game designer because I had Great Ideas. Growing up sucks.
<comment>
What were your hopes and dreams when you were a little kid and 
Be an artist, go to art school, learn to sing, learn guitar, voice actin and related 
what happened to them?
My mom always promise me that I'll go to art school but always make excuses, them my dad make us move to the south, a literal shit hole with nothing in it, make shity investment and almost lose everything thanks to that.
Now I have a shity full time job an I have no motivation to do anything
<comment>
My dream and hope was finding love, marrying, having a couple kids and living happily ever after*.
<comment>
Yeah, but what happened to stop that, anon?
<comment>
what happened to them?
Social groups counting more than substance and work happened
<comment>
I was too straightedge when I was younger and I fell for the "just bee urself meme". I didn't bother with learning how to flirt or how to attract girls, and eventually my social skills deteriorated to the point where I can't even make friends.
<comment>
Ah, I see. Same situation for us both, but I'm just a weird-o sperg who people don't really want to know as well as a dropout loser. I'm sure you can improve your social skills though, anon.

When I was 13 my plan was to stay in school as long as possible. Become a doctor or something, that way I could live on borrowed money and not have to work. Then kill myself at 30. Turns out school is actually a lot of work later on. My parents let me be NEET after high school until I was 26, so I mostly got what I wanted.

I am a daydreamer, I like coming up with ideas and stories. But I realized I will never fully realize all my ideas but it's okay, Just making things on my own and alone is enough for me. But really I just always wanted to be somewhere, I don't know where though.

I wanted to create worlds. To gorge my mind with lots of books and movies and music, to let them spark my imagination, and to share the results with my friends. I wanted to draw people into the wondrous, bizarre and over-the-top landscape that is my inner world, and let them shape it in turn.
Long story short, I've always wanted to be a tabletop RPG GM. I started GMing at 11, and... well I never really stopped ever since.
Now I'm working as a game designer, I GM on the regular, I live with two wonderful girlfriends in a flat I bought, I cook hearty, healthy meals, and I make music on the side from times to times, mostly for game jams.
All things considered I think I did pretty well for myself.

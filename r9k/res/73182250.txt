I wanna be skinny but the hunger pangs get so strong. How do I stop feeling hungry when fasting.

Have you tried drinking water? It can be a distraction plus it's good.

Unironically get a job or hobbies and join the gym. When you're busy occupying yourself, you have less time for food. I lost 50 lbs when I left my NEETdom

Yeah. But it stretches out my stomach and makes me hungrier. I feel less hungry when my stomach shrinks. Im eating a bunch of zero cal jello just now.

Yeah this might honestly be the key. I dont like eating outside or in front of people because it makes me super self conscious. I think I just need to spend more times outdoors so I dont feel tempted to eat.

Volume eating. Eat a ton of vegetables which has basically zero calories. That and get exercises. Increase both your non exercise metabolic burn by moving around more, going out, walking the dog, and your exercise one by, well, exercising.

It's not your hunger its anxiety and need for stimulation to null that anxiety, maybe limit anxiety? Food is your source of coping mechanism to deal with this anxiety. Or perhaps self sabotaging? It seems you are eating out of emotional distress rather than anything else. Check to see if you have a funny skeletal build, if so nothing you can do about it but accept and enjoy life.

Here's what you need to understand: no animal has had the access to food that we have today. If they found food, they had to eat it, and hunger had to kick in again because it might take them days of searching to find their next meal. Our concept of hunger has not caught up to our current situation, where we basically never want for food. You will be perfectly fine with not eating. Hunger, such that we feel it hours after having eaten, is not relevant to our current way of life. Essentially, the feeling of hunger doesn't actually mean hunger.

Your excessive hunger comes from a lack of nutrients. Eat animal products with minimal additives and processing whenever you aren't fasting

Fasting is temporary, get your diet together and learn to control your hunger in a more sustainable manner.
Find some stuff to keep you busy and active, running/jogging, cycling, gym membership, etc
If you're worried about getting buff there's plenty of guys into that.

Anyone else just saving money? I work work work and horde money barely spending it
<comment>
Could I temporarily lend some
<comment>
it's good to be frugal, but you should look into investing. inflation is a constant threat

No, I used to be very financially responsible. I had a job and low expenses that allowed me to put aside 500+ a month. I regret quiting my job and letting my mom pressure me into c*llege. Now I'm a depressed neet that has unstable employmemt and only survived by leeching and not spending anything in hopes of keeping my savings. I still have a little savings left and after blowing throw a bunch of money on bullshit I thought I needed and cope buys I'm determined to get an I come and go back to being responsible.

Hope you are happy and love what you do because you could drop dead tomorrow and your employer would not blink twice before replacing you

hmmmm isn't that a sin

Yeah but I ain't saving it in trash bags nor am I saving for no reason.
Part of it is a emergency fund, once thats square I will keep saving to buy some land and build a cabin or shack in the country.
I also save for retirement but those are in accounts that are tied up in long term investments and a bit of it is in physical gold. Not in cash or a standard low interest savings account.
I also have a separate chunk of cash that I save for both fun stuff and luxury items.
Like I saved up and bought a fancy composting toilet instead of the simple kind of embarrassing composting toilet I made.

you mean you're turning your own poo into compost for growing what I assume are plants for food

Being thrifty as a virtue.

No.
The compost I make isn't for growing food. mature compost I use to help grow my privacy bushes on the lot I currently stay, and I use it on my small flower garden, but mostly its just a very convenient and environmentally friendly off the grid waste disposal method for organic matter including human waste, and doesn't waste clean water.
I actually might have to "gift" the next batch of mature compost to the local hardwood cultivated forest.
But that is only if I don't choose to try to grow a new bach of flowers for autumn.
That said compost is basically just dirt by the time it fully and properly matures. Which takes about a year. It isn't just mixing shit with sawdust and then throwing it on some vegetables. It's a little more than that and it takes time.
Plus if you want food safe compost from human waste then it takes very strict protocols and even more time to make sure it's safe. Food waste compost is a lot safer for making food safe compost. 
Overall I can't be bothered to monitor the composting containers close enough to bother with making food safe compost.
Plus running it that hot produces methane and is kind of stinky. The method I use mostly stays cold, doesn't smell, and doesn't off gas anywhere near as much methane.
I have neighbors and don't own this lot after all. So I don't think they would appreciate if my compost smelled bad.

Thats why you jobhop anon. The only purpose of working is to make some cash and pad yourself a bit for a different, better job.

Only retards hoard money.
I spend it on my garden, fruit trees, berry trees, corn and potato plantation, meat freezer.
Your own food production is the most inflation stable investment you can do.
<comment>
Absolutely agreed but jobhopping and living frugally is supposed to bring you a better life. You can't live a life at all if you are working yourself to the bone constantly

Has anyone else abandoned the idea that their life hasn't started yet? Like getting past the point of saying things like, "When I grow up I'll X, Y, or Z?" I keep trying to "load in" to my life like a new game with the backstory I lived as a foundation, but I find myself forgetting that there is a day after today. I know there is logically, but I don't "believe" it sometimes. Thoughts?

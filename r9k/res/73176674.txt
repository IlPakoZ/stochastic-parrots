No girl that believers her brother is gay would buy him girl clothes unless she already thought he was androgenous effeminate and could pull it off
<comment>
throw it in the trash and refuse contact

should i just stop talking to her?

call her a social media junkie scrolling her brain away on tiktok and instagram. then watch her break down crying
<comment>
I would beat her like I did my sister when I was 15 for talking shit

I couldn't even buy my mother a hairbrush without being suspected of transqueer. Did you buy your sister the clothes and then she regift?
<comment>
found the social media junkie. go back to tiktok you subhuman animal

How about you do actually become a real man, what you need to do is get your ass into a gym and build some muscle, your sister is most likely speaking the truth
<comment>
youre poor and a ghetto hood rat
<comment>
questioned your masculinity
Beat her up and stop talking to you.
disrespected you by buying you female clothing
Beat her into a pulp, rape her, kill her afterwards.

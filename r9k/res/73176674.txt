my sister said im not a real man because i dont go out often and i dont have friends or a girlfriend. i think she thinks im gay. she bought me womens clothing for christmas. what should i do? should i just stop talking to her?
Punch and rape her, show her womens opinions do not matter
No girl that believers her brother is gay would buy him girl clothes unless she already thought he was androgenous effeminate and could pull it off
throw it in the trash and refuse contact
This one
call her a social media junkie scrolling her brain away on tiktok and instagram. then watch her break down crying
I would beat her like I did my sister when I was 15 for talking shit
Start reading books and lifting weights you fucking loser
I couldn't even buy my mother a hairbrush without being suspected of transqueer. Did you buy your sister the clothes and then she regift?
found the social media junkie. go back to tiktok you subhuman animal
How about you do actually become a real man, what you need to do is get your ass into a gym and build some muscle, your sister is most likely speaking the truth
youre poor and a ghetto hood rat
questioned your masculinity
Beat her up and stop talking to you.
Beat her into a pulp, rape her, kill her afterwards.
are you gay? how is it even possible to be a virgin in 2023.
Here is your (You), Anon

thank you for the (You)

it's still pathetic to be sexless, loser.

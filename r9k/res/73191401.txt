I make a lot of money but I'm not attractive. I just want a girl to let me obsess over her and fall in love with me. How do I find this, robros?
Personality goes much father than looks when it comes to actual relationships.
I'm attractive but don't make a lot of money, let's fuse together and maybe we'll become someone dateable
Have you considered using the money to become attractive? Alternatively just buy a Ferrari.
go to the third world "to find yourself" anon
do lots of activities to interact with local women, be nice to them
You still need to lure her in with looks
I bet you're still 100x more dateable than me
Is this real or a meme? I've tried talking to girls in third world countries online and they were as ghostful and in demand as women in America
it's not a meme, but you have to move your ass and talk to the girls in their home turf, you can flaunt your cash around as much as you want but they are getting taken out for dinner, party and get fucked by other potential partners. You can't compete if you're just a dating app avatar.
Any countries you'd suggest?
How? Plastic surgery?

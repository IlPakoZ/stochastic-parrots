It's not like I posted anything illegal or even 18+, but all the cringy stuff I posted/commented 5-6 years ago pops up when I put the online aliases I used over the years into Google.

We've entered the age where normalfags using their real name say some inhumanely stupid shit on twitter and get the epic ratio and it's forgotten within a day, don't worry OP

To Women,
I resent you.You are a creature so selfish and disinterested that it has spread and seeped into me as well. I have no enthusiasm in you anymore. The passion and joy stripped and shamed from me. The cries are not your problem. The desperation is not a call to action but creepy. You live for yourself and everyone owes you this and owes you that. In your heart is a world of petty, self centered meaninglessness. Your soul is dead isn't it? I am alone even if you were beside me. I wanted love ya know. It's a shame you're so awful and killed it in me. I think i liked that guy. You deserve the iciest cruel looks God can muster. Your pain is more than justified. It's silly really. I regret that i cannot see how to make this world less callous and selfish and awful.

Dear Anon
As tears stream down my stony, catatonic face, bereft of all signs vitality I realize that thing might not be okay. I see no hope in other people. I'm sorry for this whole world anon. Thank you for the virtual hug.
With sorrowful tears,
-Anon

Hi Klaus, do you have my old name filtered yet? Are you still fucking children's sneakers every time they let you out of the hospital?

i don't think women are worth having so many feelings over, they're just opportunistic and manipulative, that's all
if there is anything that can be gained from you, they like you, be it material, social or egotistical

Dear Anon,

No. They are not. Forgive me. I was just really hoping to love someone, and I am in mourning for that person who did. I mourn a world of pain like mine. I mourn a world of pain greater than mine.

Are you shy, Klaus? Why won't you talk to me, you big stinker? You would have never discovered your love of fucking kiddie shoes without me, remember?

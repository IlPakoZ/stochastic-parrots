What does this have to do with toenails?

my most embarrassing story from middle school:
This happened 7 years ago when I was 14 and I'm still not completely over it
but why
I was 13, full of hormones and I thought I was gay so I could be le cool fag kid and get attention, it was stupid and immature I know. In my defense I'm bi at least and I had had faggy feelings by then.

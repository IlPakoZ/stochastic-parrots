class excercise where you do CPR on a dummy
in the midst of giving CPR, there is suddenly blood on the dummy
somehow i split my nail
teacher gives me a bandaid, but for some reason i just hold my finger up while the teacher puts the bandaid on, even though i'm an 18 year old man instead of a child in kindergarten
everyone saw
I was autopiloting through all that and I didn't realize how I was supposed to put the bandaid on myself until I went home. Also, we were later doing the Heimlich manuever on a dummy and I was the only man who didn't have the strength to dislodge the object. Aside from me, the only students who couldn't do it were women.

me.eat(self.toenails);
<comment>
Toenails have a nice fermented taste. Like an aged cheese. Not for everyone though, definitely an acquired taste.

6th grade
french class
teacher is discussing whatever
I'm not listening, going through worksheet
mess up paper
I'm in the front row of the class, so I decide to throw the paper into the trash from where I'm sat
teacher walks in line of where I'm throwing as I do, nearly hits them
paper doesn't make it
teacher is mad, tells me to get up and throw the paper away like a normal person
get up, whole class is watching
somehow manage to fall over while I'm trying to pick the paper up, everyone still watching in silence
sit back down, tearing up for whatever fucking reason
kid next to me asks if I'm ok, which makes me even more ashamed

What does this have to do with toenails?

here's another
1st grade
Christmas
last week of school, get to play party games all day
playing pass the parcel, everyone sat on the floor in a circle
when the music stops, you get to unwrap a layer of the present and get a toy as a prize
last layer of wrapping, music stops on me
tear up the wrapping, there are two toys inside!
assume this is because it's the last layer, start celebrating in excitement
the teacher, mad, finally gets my attention
apparently whoever got to the last layer was meant to leave one of the toys in, so the game could continue
teacher say's I've now spoilt the game for the rest of the kids with my greediness
feeling anger, shame, embarrassment
stand up and scream in the teacher's face that I hadn't ruined the game
curl up into a ball, don't respond to anything the teachers do
they just leave me there while the rest of the kids go to break, indoors cause it's too cold out
other kids go off to another room for next period, I'm still curled up on the floor
janitor comes in to vacuum, tells me to get up
I don't
janitor picks me up and moves me out of the way, vacuums, leaves
sat in the classroom alone
<comment>
and another
10th grade
puberty hits, can't stop thinking about sex
girl in English class. Thinking back she was just a normal looking girl, but to 15 year old me she was sexual desire incarnate
spend most English periods either staring at her, or trying to do work whilst also staring at her
one day, staring as usual, hear laughing
girl's friend, sat on other side of the table, sees me
I see her
look back at girl, she's looking back at me
snap head to front of the class, face burning
don't look back for the rest of the class, can still hear them laughing
girl avoided me after that, giving me odd looks in the halls

10th grade
have had a circle of online friends for a few years already
have online girlfriend who isn't really into me romantically but goes along with it anyways
am infatuated with this girl
have crush on a couple girls at school before this
one crush is even bigger and persists after I get in the online relationship
girl is tall, cool, and funny, good interests, most popular girl in our grade
always friendly with me and joking around
one day after class she says she is attracted to me
don't know what to do, partly because I consider myself in a relationship and also just don't know what to say
deer in headlights just say "okay"
run away to my next class as quick as I can without saying anything else
break up with the other girl later that year because she is sick of faking it
she leaves next year but comes back to our school senior year
deeply regret this and still friendly with her after this but clearly just platonic at this point or she is just frustrated with me
mom pressures me into asking her to our private school's shitty not-prom thing
call her and she says it's not really a couple thing anyways(true)
still hang out with her there but pretty much just sit around silently
not confident enough so never ask her for a real date anywhere
put something funny in my yearbook looking back I know she still liked me and I blew it
said she was too busy for our class reunion so I didn't even see her there
at class reunion realize I was never that close to any of these people except like one guy. they all want to talk to others instead so my wife and I just stand around. 
the other people I was close to don't show up either
embarrassed because they have a blowup of our seniors page of the yearbook up on and my senior quote is cringe especially in hindsight of how my life has gone after
everyone has moved away and/or has a better career
Fuck school. It's not like I had a terrible time but my life basically didn't begin until I was 22.

tell female friend I'm gay
turns out I'm not gay 
fall in love with her
hang with her a lot
she finds out I like her because my friend squealed
she doesn't speak to me for more than a year
class chad regularly calls me creepy because of it
This happened 7 years ago when I was 14 and I'm still not completely over it
<comment>
tell female friend I'm gay 
but why
<comment>
I was 13, full of hormones and I thought I was gay so I could be le cool fag kid and get attention, it was stupid and immature I know. In my defense I'm bi at least and I had had faggy feelings by then.

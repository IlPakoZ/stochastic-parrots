Kind of curious how many people have been locked up, what for, and their experiences.
I've been to jail dozens of times but never convicted, never minded it much but been used to it since it started as a kid and I'm in my thirties. Last one I couldn't make bail so sat around, got beat on intake because I called the co's pussy which is a bad call. I have some funny stories from over the years but I'd rather share them if people are actually interested. I don't know this board but I'm guessing there's better replies here.

Fuck no, no point. I was drunk and uppity and the command room was right next to the holding cell they took me to meaning no cameras. It was a bullshit arrest with no PC but you never win those as despite having two fancy jails neither our city nor deps wear bodycams. You basically just take it. One of their favorite things is cuffing you and having two big greens knee your neck and lower section and yanking the cuffs up as hard as hard as they can and drive tazing you with some body punches. Hurts but you won't die.
Can't sue shit if there are no cameras.

How did you come up with your usernames?

I just browse random things like books or my music library until I see a word that catches my eye and then I use that, sometimes slightly modified.

I invented my own characters when I was a child and used them for my usernames, and I still do to this day.

I've been using the same usernames online for 30+ years now, so most of them are still old anime characters or shit I thought up for AD&amp;D campaigns in the 90s.

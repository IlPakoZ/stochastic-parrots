Even if you found a partner they would only care about you insofar as you provide utility. Nobody will ever love you because you are you, they will basically just be using you. I am ending things.

The only unconditional love you might get is from your parents, no one else has a real reason to love unconditionally. If you actually had a partner you'd quickly realise this.

because you are you
This sounds like an excuse to not fix yourself. If it is you shouldn't be in a relationship. Not everyone, just you. That's all I can say.

Stop being a whiny bitch. That is why no one cares, you are a have me pity bitch. No one likes people like that. Everyone has problems, deal with them as everyone else and live a decent life instead of crying on a loser infested site.

My parents were never involved in my life. I have had multiple partners.
You know nothing about me. Kill yourself pseud. 
I would bash your head in. stupid mongrel.

live a decent life
OP is saying that's not possible though. If I can't be genuinely loved for who I am, then I cannot live a decent life.

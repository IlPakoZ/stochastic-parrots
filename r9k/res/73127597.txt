I realized incels and normies are the exact same
completely superficial, judge everyone and everything on a surface level only 
serious halo/horns psychology, worship beautiful people
love negativity, drama and talking shit, always have something bad and bitter to say when they see someone else happy or succeeding 
obsessed with having sex to the point they make it their 95% of their personality and brain matter
incels are transnormies - ie, normies born "in the wrong body".
They have co-opted being a robot, just like all good things are co-opted.
Not to say robots didn't struggle with sex and relationships - but it was one part of a multi-faceted difficult experience of being an outsider in all aspects of life, not the sole issue.
I can't stand these failed normies.
Agree, incels are toxic Chad bullies in weak ugly bodies.
It's funny
I get called a fag, tranny, perma-incel, weakling, etc. in legitimately 30% of the posts I make here just for sharing my feelings instead of talking about how much I hate women constantly or how I want to rape them
I guess that gets boring when you have had girlfriends.

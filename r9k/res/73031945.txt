Is it really this bad these days?
you couldve drove through again, force them to give your order or youll park right there in the line
Yeah that shit is a waste of time. The whole point of fast food is to just get it and get the fuck out.
I stopped going after multiple times they'd give me a mcdouble when I ordered a triple cheeseburger. Not even a double cheese burger, a mcdouble. I sent a couple emails to corporate which they ignored completely. They don't give a single shit about their brand or customers. Probably unaffordable now anyway. Eating whole foods has always been way cheaper than the so called unhealthy food but now the processed shit has more than doubled from the already high prices.

Need gf to bake pastries with, cook homemade Italian dinners for, watch movies with, wash eachother's bodies and to sit on my face
wow this sounds like me and this sounds like my robot. you're not him are you?
need gf to go to work for me, buy me things, pay property taxes and utilities bills, prepare food for me, not get mad at me for not taking showers, let me play video games in my dark goblincave all day, and sit on my face
I know this is a troll post, btu the funny thing is girls can literally do the female equivalent of this if they want to. They are even more submissive naturally most of the times sexually, so they'd probably like that lifestyle even more
This is true, but I have a penis, and I want a GF just like I described, who financially supports me, lets me be a stinky mess, and sits on my face a lot. If I was born a girl, I think I'd be rich at this point/already basically retired.
I also drink a lot and smoke, and I'd like to start smoking in the house (still live with my parents, hope that's not a deal breaker im only in my 30s and hey baby, they're gonna die some day.)
i'd be rich
No you would live in some nerd's two room cageflat, only given bare minimum to survive. Not that you would mind but. "Rich" is only applicable to people who own their own money.
I'd run an OF/Patreon/self-host and do cosplay and shit for lonely weeb simps. As long as I was attractive, yes, yes I would be rich. Making money as a female is about as hard as figuring out how to wipe your own ass.

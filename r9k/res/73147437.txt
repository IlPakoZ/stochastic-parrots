Is the urge to kill people a legitimate reason to join the army?
Sure why not. Either you get to kill people *legally* for your country or get killed in action, which is also good considering you're a potential threat to society.
Looks like a win-win scenario baby.
Yeah but don't tell them that. Say you need the money or the GI bill or whatever.
Soldiers are no different than mercenaries except they get worse pay.
I doubt you'd pass basic but if you did you'd probably outgrow this phase
To add to that, you probably won't get a chance to kill anyone regardless unless it's friendly fire. You could serve for a while and get specialized training so you can get hired by a pmc later. You really have to know your shit though because pmcs are starved for bodies.

they cope by also going on dates
when the average Japanese guy is 5'6 you're not short you're average

I'm going to cope by moving to Japan where I will just be a normal height and all the girls will be shorter than. Bonus that the women there are more feminine and less evil. I've already learnt Japanese and gotten a degree, I just need to get a couple years experience in the field to get a job over there.

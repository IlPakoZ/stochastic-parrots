What am I supposed to do now? Get a job? That's gay...
Get a job, find someone who will save you or do an hero. There isn't much more to do in this society.
Its probably about time you are activated and sprreee on some people break the recordd
Appeal? Re-apply for slightly different reasons? If you do, get an expert on it, are there free advice centres for spergs and cripples near you? Just remember, when you're talking to the neetbux people, always describe your worst days, not your best ones. Also wouldn't hurt to take your mother or a family member, because psychologically you can't cope with assessments like that. Which is probably true, but it also makes you look like a useless unemployable manchild, all good stuff for the govt to see.
Get a job or kys retard
Literally : 
I will never ever get a job, I will NEET whether I do it legally or not.
Also if the prison-situation isnt too bad in your country, commit some kind of crime to NEET it out in jail. I'd be fine here because prisons are basically 3-star hotels, I would even get a playstation and a tv

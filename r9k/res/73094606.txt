Ceiling for my lifespan is 314 years
Probably blew 9 years by not exercising daily as a child and teenager, but it was well worth it
Going to outlive everyone in an underground bunker while everyone else is dying
I guess it's good.
I'm probably the world's oldest man as well as the world's smartest. They said somebody lived to 500, but they were a hermit nobody remembers.
Probably 342 years

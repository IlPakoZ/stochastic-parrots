In a future where humanity has mastered dna manipulation and you can choose any and all traits that your offspring will have, how big do you make your son's cock?

Irrelevant and irrelevant. Now answer my question. If you're gonna make an ama style thread, you gotta at least put in the effort to answer questions
<comment>
identity theft is a crime bitch!1!!!!
<comment>
You talk in a very confusing mannor comrade. Also I don't need help talking to women or getting laid, thats easy. The problem is that all women want the same shit and I am just not into it. They aren't girlfriend material.
<comment>

<comment>
Generic
What makes you so unfuckable then
<comment>
the autism and adhd
<comment>
And that matters in hookup culture?
<comment>
i forgot to mention i don't leave my house
<comment>
Do you think presenting myself as a fan would give most folk the "ick?"
I think I like it too much regardless, admittedly.
<comment>
hot, i would do it for your reaction. any more description
<comment>
i dont think so. i personally find it endearing. girls like that kind of stuff.
lol id probably accidentally kick you
<comment>
proof for those who missed it

<comment>
Films/television or books?
Hot weather or cold weather?
Cuddling or rough stuff?
Vocaroo response preferred.
<comment>
What are your aspirations? Any goals you have for the future? Whats your favorite color?
<comment>
That feels reassuring to know.
These days, I imagine most people don't care all to much for Peanuts. They've probably heard of it, watched a few specials and maybe read a strip or two, but have no strong attachment to it.

<comment>
why do women feel entitled to bodily autonomy, they only have it because men gave it to them in the first place
<comment>
i wanna be an art director, specifically for film. so ya my goal would be college for that. i've been working on my portfolio.
baby blue is my favorite color. but pink is a close second.
<comment>
Oh I didn't actually expect that, thanks. Saw is great, looking forward to Saw X, hopefully it gets the franchise back on track
<comment>
everyone deserves the right to bodily autonomy, humans aren't some weird hivemind
<comment>
me tooooo i can't wait. what did you think of Spiral? i liked it better than Jigsaw but it's not hard to be better than Jigsaw.
<comment>
How old are you? Do you like any specific accents?
<comment>
why? rights do not exist in nature. youve not made any point besides
uhhh, because they just do OK?!
<comment>
What's the appeal of this board for you? I just don't see why any female would want to spend time here
<comment>
Yea, I liked it better too, but it still sorta sucked. It just wasn't as fun and silly as the original series. Personally, I'm hoping Tobin Bell returns as Jigsaw's evil twin, because fuck it why not!
<comment>
people here are chill and can be funny.
<comment>
i meant the color or something anon...
<comment>
18. i really like british accents (any kind) and nigerian and indian accents. they're so musical in a way and calming.
<comment>
gotchu. i'm white and pretty pale so my feet are too. they're pretty soft since i don't get out much. i also get pedicures often.
<comment>
Damn, I have an English accent but you're a little young for me, unfortunately. Not that anything was gonna happen, but still.
<comment>
it's all good. accents are nice in any situation.
<comment>
That they are. You have a sweet sounding voice, by the way. Nice to hear somebody talk without, like, adding, like, like, every, like, other word, like this.
<comment>
i agree, they take themselves too seriously now. after the backlash they got from 3D they tried to be all gritty and cool.
<comment>
thank you, anon! i'm glad you like my mannerisms lol
<comment>
I think the 3D made it even funnier, in a terrible way. I was there opening night with those stupid glasses, watching body parts fly into the screen was great.
<comment>
i love the scene with Jill and the RBT, but the pink blood was always off putting
<comment>
Are you lonely? Whose dick do you want? Can you lighten up at all? Are you ugly or hot?
<comment>
I liked Jill and the...err...rollercoaster thing? I don't even remember what that was, turned out to be a dream but that was so damn funny.
<comment>
yeah, i'm lonely. i'm not picky. i'm actually a pretty positive person in my personal life, just not when it comes to myself. idk if i'm ugly or hot. i'm not one to judge and i also have a very distorted self image.
i distinctly remember each of her tits being thrown in a separate direction and that damn near killed me
<comment>
Honk honk

i remember that omg it's one of my favorites
<comment>
Just in case you haven't seen it in a while, it's possible you didn't notice on a first viewing, but Saw IV is the funniest because they went all out on these bizarre avant-garde scene transitions. It's like a whole new meta-level of hilarity. Highly recommend a rewatch with that in mind.

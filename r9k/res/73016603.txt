why do incels reject slutty girls? i want to save an incel and make him my personal sex slave
<comment>
How slutty are you
<comment>
Its less of a rejection and more a sort of value statement. Slutty girls are more expensive than other women, especially towards incels.
If sluts were free/incels were the ones making the charge for them, incels wouldn't be nearly as mad.
If youre a slut, go offer an incel nsa sex and see where it goes from there. Instead of expecting him to treat you like something you aren't
<comment>
I would because no girl wants a inexperienced guy
<comment>
I wont reject you before you take my virginity ;)
<comment>
over 70 bodies but i don't remember since i was drunk for most of them lmao.
i want a bf not just to fuck him.
i want one with no experience whatsoever.
<comment>
A boyfriend you don't have sex with is no boyfriend, and if hes an incel hes not going to want to entertain a slut without sex. 
You have to have sex with him first to make things worth his time. If you just want to scam the guy of his time so you can feel like less of a slut simps already exist, you dont need to lie to incel about your intentions.

make him my personal sex slave
I will never be a slave. FREEDOM!!!!!!!
<comment>
I have never rejected anyone but gay men.
<comment>
Because they are deeply insecure and are constantly thinking they will never live up to another man so they try and turn it around and fetishize their own virginity to protect their ego
Take it from an old bot, before this place was overrun with incel teenagers, stop being such a pussy and fuck the sluts, sex isn't some mystical world changing event and after you get some experience doing it you won't worry about measuring up to other men
<comment>
Can you dominate me, tie me up and use me every day?
<comment>
stop being such a pussy and fuck the sluts
I don't have any interactions with females in my life. There are no sluts to just fuck
<comment>
Keep fighting for mlady Simpy Mcknight, im sure she will sleep with you one of these days. Any minute now
<comment>
Would you be loyaI? I have mixed feelings about sluts.
<comment>
i want one with no experience whatsoever
why?
<comment>
worried about measuring up to other men
whores aren't gross or immoral youre just afraid that your tiny dick wont do the job
You were never an incel if you've ever thought this.
This form of thinking at best is just soft cuckoldry, if not a cope from women.
<comment>
This is a larp but I'll respond as if it isn't; they aren't, most guys who say they wouldn't date a slut would absolutely do so if a slut showed interest in them. Inversely, women truly do not want inexperienced guys and they never will.
<comment>
This is a larp
it absolutely is but at least OP replies to people
<comment>
That is not how it works, you should be my sex slave to make up for all the sex I have not had. Don't worry I will fuck you good, got a decent penis, just hate women so fucking much.
<comment>
They're having meltdowns because it's true
<comment>
Sluttiness is only a problem in subs.
<comment>
Because I want someone in a similar place in life.
People spam "opposites attract each other" all the time, but I couldn't find it farther from the truth.
I find comfort when hanging out with people with a similar mind and similar values, and in the case of women, I can't even develop attraction if she is too distant of who I am.
<comment>
How about an actual argument buddy
<comment>
Personally, I just don't think you could possibly remain loyal. Considering how nonchalant you are about sex.
<comment>
I want a girl to think they are making me their sex slave, only for me to reverse it on her and make her my sub.
<comment>
best post in the thread but no replies since it ruins the narrative, as usual.
<comment>
Have you considered getting a gf?

I don't
i want to save an incel and make him my personal sex slave
Pick me
<comment>
unironically it's because those types of girls make me feel jealous and insecure. i wish i had those types of experiences where i could express my sexuality more openly with other people as easily as you can. i really wish sexual relationships came to me super naturally and it felt normal. and when i hear people who have similar experiences as you and makes me extremely jealous and angry at them even though i know it's not their fault. seeing other people get what i want more easily than me because they were simply born more attractive and not autistic just makes me sad and upset
<comment>
i want one with no experience whatsoever
I like how it's not enough that I will never be attractive to anyone nor while I have get any attention from women, I also need to be mocked relentlessly by larpers on the one place where robots used to congregate.
<comment>
sex isn't some mystical world changing event
It is though, it's fucking amazing. Life without regular sex is dull in comparison

Really feeling this post, anon. I don't even feel comfortable expressing any kind of sexual desire because I feel so ugly. Feels like I'm so ugly, I shouldn't be okay for me to have sexual feelings.
<comment>
Disgusting. Not even a giga Chad would look at you if they knew you slept around that much, used hole
<comment>
Stop having self respect and become hedonistic because ego
Pass.

<comment>
I'm gonna be honest
I forgot how to engage with people in a sexual way
My ex is so obviously horny around me but I just can't bring myself to say or do the things I used to
guilt is keeping me quiet
<comment>

Gee that sure is a brain buster
<comment>
can someone please give me some motivation or inspiration? I want to flirt, I want to make them feel sexy
I just do not feel like it's good, like I am bad for wanting these things
<comment>
if i wanted a slut i'd just fuck a prostitute

90% wouldn't reject it desu. You're bamboozled by the vocal minority.
<comment>
I don't even need to read the thread beyond the OP to know that "she" never followed up and contacted anyone in this thread who requested it.

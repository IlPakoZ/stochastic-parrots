Striped panties
Why would you catch my attention like this anon
<comment>

<comment>
The cat in this pic would be a great and cool pfp (im a femanon)
<comment>
youre not cool unless youre deluded that youre the main character so go with a killua from hxh
<comment>

do you wanna play zomboid?
and here you are NOT helping
ty for your considerations I decided to go with pic rel to make me seem mysterious as well
<comment>
oops heres pic rel pfp
<comment>
Whats zomboid?
Im sorry op but no... please dont pick that one that is no good
<comment>
idk anon, i'd reconsider, that icon would turn me off.
<comment>
Whats zomboid?
a video games about surviving a zombie apocalypses. you basically beat up zombies and play house. I can be the pretend husband and I'll let you be my wife
you're a fembot too? do you wanna play zomboid? you can be my pretend wife if the other fembot doesnt wanna buy it. if she gets it tho we might have to turn this into a harem 
idk anon, i'd reconsider, that icon would turn me off.
what about this one? it's me irl when I hear a cute girl in game
<comment>
Dude this has to be bait you can't be that retarded... this pic is just as bad
<comment>
It's bait, don't fall for it. Either that or I've finally ascended r9k to the point where I can't genuinely tell trolls from this level of social incompetence anymore.
<comment>
extremely based
you better play with him
<comment>
it suppose to be funny yet show a tiny hint of my honesty. do you have zomboid or not? I dont have time for your shenanigans
what are you trying to say? I just want a good pfp and to play project zomboid
<comment>
i'm sorry, my net is too 3rd world-y to play games with anyone atm. otherwise i'd play in a heartbeat.
what about this one? it's me irl when I hear a cute girl in game
it's good, but i made it cuter just for you. i'm sure you'll get lotsa qts with this one.
<comment>

<comment>
I cri

<comment>
If you want to be really cool just use standard/no profile picture. That's what I'm using and it doesn't seem like it makes a difference.
<comment>
don't listen to him, anime pfp are a good way of scoping out tastes.
<comment>
when your hot pockets isn't hot enough

femboy twink opinion
<comment>
As someone who is often times considered "cool" in social circles let me just say that aside from not namefagging on 4chan literally every single last part of your post indicates that you will never be able to pull off the "cool dude" persona.
Part of being cool is not giving a fuck what anyone thinks and forging your own path. Have a strong attitude but don't a douchy cunt. Have fun and don't take anything online seriously. When you see a picture you like and you know it will be a good pfp go for it. That or make up your own.
<comment>
femanon here, i see ur asking the other anons in the thread if they wanna play zomboid? im down but im kinda bad at it lol. anyways for the pfp reccomendation i think this would be cool, might just be me though im a sucker for this tarkov esque aesthetic
<comment>
This is one of the pictures of all time. Not sure if it's ideal for a profile pic though.
<comment>
this one would make me think you're a simp
<comment>
femanon here
likes tarkov esque aesthetic
you have a penis? it's okay if you're bad I can use playing with you to attract other robots. hopefully we can get someone that knows how to set up the server andmake it fun. what's your steam id?
<comment>

thats my steam id, i cant play right now though, since im outside. also im not a troon lol. i may be slightly mentally ill and autistic, but not to the level of chopping my tits off
<comment>
This one is mine. Wallace is a cool guy (like me) unlike you (faggot)
<comment>
are openly racist dudes cool dudes?
Yes
<comment>
okay when you're ready to play I can find more people
<comment>
add me on steam, i can message you when i can play, or maybe i could add you on discord? whatever works for you
<comment>
The "coolest" dudes I've meet either had anime pfp (good friends), cat pfp (nice silly people), or something that made them unique.
Worst people are the ones who have the joker as pfp (anime joker don't count) or something misogynistic

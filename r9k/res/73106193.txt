went to the psychologist today
40 dlls for 1 hour
 all I did was solve a 100 piece jigsaw
is this normal?
Yes it's normal to be scammed by scammers. Psychologists are entirely useless to society. They basically get paid to exist
you wont see any use out of psych sessions until like 10th time or something because they have a whole bunch of assessments and questionnaires they need to go through first.

how do i get smooth skin like a girl? or just smooth femmy skin. soft and smooth thats what i want.
find EVERY skin care product and fucking SLATHER YOURSELF IN IT (mix it all together in a big pot)
Become my slut first and then I will tell you step by step
Not sure, but I have a similar question. How do I get a really thin waist? I wanna go femboy mode, but my acne and wide waist is holding me back
you don't wanna do that lol. 
lotion, bathing (scrub yourself well but not too hard as that spreads oils. also use a loofa.), wash your sheets every week to avoid pimples and oil and stuff. I'm not a foid and I don't even do any of these things I just lurk on crystal cafe
Unironically that'd be one of the main effects of taking estradiol (hrt).
Some guys go on it just for the skin and hair benefits even though they don't identify as trans.
diyhrt.cafe if you want to buy some from the internet without a prescription.
If you're eating a good amount while taking it you will probs grow some tits though so plan around that with some tape or layered shirts to hide them.
this is a tranny shill
no they do not lol. maybe finasterone or whatever that anti balding stuff is but not estradiol.
Begone you groomer freak
i wish trans people could just settle for being gay
Literally was a thread about this just today. Multiple anons take hrt purely for hair or skin benefits without being trans.

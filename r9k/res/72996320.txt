Going for a walk and learning how to empty your mind from endless consumerism and being at peace with a quiet mind is a good idea. I like to bring a notebook with me on my walks so I can record and sketch what I see.

employ the CEO mindset. minmax the fuck out of your life as if you were playing a video game. it's all that's left to do now and you know it. fuck this piece of shit world, live in full spite of it. let the flame of ambition consume you and transcend, that shit is nirvana on crack

go on a hike (touch grass)

Seems like you're a retard and planned your entire future around watching anime and playing video games like a manchild.
I don't get it how you end up 20/30-something and just then realize your copes no longer work. How low does your IQ need to be for this to happen?
No sympathy start enjoying your shit copes again or kill yourself. No escape.

But you won't, should have used that peanut brain to think ahead. This board is so shit man, it's filled with smug retards who think they will just watch anime for the rest of their lives, they always end up like this but for now they get to act smug and superior.
Kys faggots you probably were like them 10 years ago.

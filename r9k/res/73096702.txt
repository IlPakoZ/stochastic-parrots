Lmao that guy. No wonder he is always sitting down in his videos. He lost to the other manlet with the Asian gf too
i'm short. is a very very bad idea for us to have normie hair and clothing style. we look ridiculous trying to perform normie masculinity, but look at prince, lil uzi, ronnie james dio... based noncel manlets
I'm so glad I'm short so I can be a cute little bottom for men who are glad they aren't short
short people like us need to fashionschizo maxxx otherwise we look like old people larping as teenagers
michael is a fucking chad and asians are all manlets so it's no big deal
context? never knew this midge was a right wing grifter
That feeling when you will never have a Brett Cooper like girlfriend
he is dating brett cooper?! lucky dude isn't he 15 years older than her? you really only need money
No, they're not dating. He just showed up in a video she was doing about trying to buy a house in Nashville.
I do want a girl like her. A girl who is feminine but not too girly, smart, and cute.

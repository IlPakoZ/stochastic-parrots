My gf is almost 50 and im in my early 20s
She got raped and lost her virginity when she was about 20 
He was her friends older bf and dropping the two off at night
The friend got dropped up first and then he drove the car to the middle of nowhere locked the door and raped her
I cant stop thinking about it even though she told me about it months ago
It makes me want to die so bad
the wall the wall! women will become unfuckable incels after they get 30 and then...
If the rapist didnt do time or get reported... Anon I...
She says he wore a condom
Also i cant really see why she would tell me about it if it wasnt actually a rape
I can't lie, it is always a turn on when I read about stuff like that.. it would be even hotter if it was by a group of guys. I wouldn't ever want to hurt anyone but I guess I'm still jealous.
Yeah i found it kind of hot too which makes me even more suicidal
Ya. Women lying bothers me too
Why would she lie about it? Wouldnt it be much easier to just not tell me it

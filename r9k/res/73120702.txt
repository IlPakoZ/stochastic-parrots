open up to a girl 
it backfires again 
Not sure why I keep trying this, I keep lowering my standards for women's empathy over and over and they keep failing again and again. Women literally only care if you turn them on, and I'm not pathetic or attractive enough to give them a intense sense of sexual power over me, which is usually the real thing that compensates for women tolerating a man opening up to her instead of her supposed 'empathy'. 
Men are still expected to be the emotional rock, yet women don't have to do any traditionally feminine roles anymore, it's bullshit. Anyone else stuck in the limbo hell between Chad and weak, pathetic, submissive femboi
nigga just get to the point where you dont have to "open up", When you dont have any traumas or whatever, thats the best time to find a gf. women are like plants you gotta shine sunlight at them
what i mean is, if your suffering from some kind of trauma still, get to the point where it doesnt bother you, before getting a gf

What are some things you guys are nostalgic about? I started listening to some old Touhou IYOSIS song and they still slap. I also found my old Tamagotchi and gave it a new battery. The one thing I wish came back were YouTube annotations as at least a feature turned off by default so the site doesn't get screwed. Maybe been strolling memory lane too long. Lol.

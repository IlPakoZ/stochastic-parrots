because we're the incel race

Indians had already perfected the art of inceldom long before whites started losing the ability to pull tail.

why is every asian so tiny and frail? why is every indian male a street pooper? the world is a weird place
<comment>
They have a genetic defect that converts t into an enzyme that causes balding.

Its a myth that Asians are tiny and frail. The average South Korean is 5ft10 which is the same as the average US white male. You have a confirmation bias since most Asian immigrants to the west are Hong Kong and Southern Chinese originally from poor peasant families.

Rampant porn addicts, they go bald in their early 20's.

You dont know shit about endocrinology .
What you call an "enzyme" is DHT, its not an enzyme, what it does is ot binds to androgen receptors in your skin and bones. Its the hormone that regulates your hair growth, pibe growth, penis size and epiphiseal closure (growth plate closure).
It doesnt "cause hair loss" unless a high % of your total T is being converted to it, which is not the 'fault' of DHT, its because of high shbg, whole other discussion but my point is, you dont know shit lol

Share about music you've made, are making, or planning to make. Of course, you can also talk about other anons' music, if you'd like. I don't really have any new music to share this time, so I'll just send one of my older songs.

I feel you'd sound good in an emo song.
EDM isn't too much my thing, but it was an enjoyable listen. 
I've also been thinking about making an album with all the unfinished stuff I've done, because I never actually finish songs. I listened all the way to And His Name Was Lossten Translayshon, which is a fun name, but also a really good song. I really enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the other tracks leading to this one, it's fun listening to small little discarded ideas. 
I also haven't posted anything on Soundcloud in a good while, so it'd be good.
Speaking of my Soundcloud, people have been asking me where they can listen to more of my music. I haven't released music in a good while, but you can listen to songs all the way up to when I first started making music. https://soundcloud.com/debomba

I'll bump your bump because OP deserves it. He's been sticking the schedule even though it doesn't get the attention it deserves weekly.

Let's get serious here for a moment, is there any hope for white people going forward. Any at all? If not, what is the ETA on their actual extinction. 100 years? 200? How long will white humans continue to exist for. 
(not me in the pic and not racist because I'm white, just curious about futurology)
the fuck does it matter if you're white
you could say the same for asians
25% of the global population is East Asian. Idiot.
They will never go extinct, there are white groups like menonnites that double their population every 20 years. But it will most definitely be reduced because most white people don't breed.
Only a matter of time before Mennonite girls get exposed to BBC and go black only.

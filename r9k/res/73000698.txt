Is the average male so sexually deprived that if a hot girl wanted them to live as their "baby girl", they would follow through? Talking your random guy off the streets.
Random guy of the streets: no
Average millennial/genZ internet user: yes
Me: yes, no questions asked
Most people would take it just for the relationship aspect even if they weren't into the rest, I couldn't do it even if I wanted to because I get embarrassed too easily and would constantly be ashamed.

No. Thats way to degen for 99.9999% of people. That being said most guys are horny morons and do stupid shit for pussy all the time.

No.

Probably.
Guys are willing to subject themselves to 80+ hour workweeks for life in diehard careers like investment banking, big law etc. just to get pussy. Playing out some fetish like that for a hot girl is easy mode by comparison. Women don't realize how lonely it can get as a guy. Women complain that the food they get doesn't taste right, but many guys are out here starving for the smallest sliver of affection from the opposite sex.

I'm a literal amputee, I lost my right leg in an accident and wear a prosthetic. I'm an autistic shut-in with severe emotional issues and I get scared easily around loud noises. I work at a fucking grocery store and I barely get paid anything. And what little I do make I waste on rent and shit that I buy from the thrift store like clothes and anime dvds.
Trust me, you wouldn't WANT to date me. Be glad that I have forced myself to become a lesbian. Because I know for a fact that outside of the "Lol I want an autistic girlfriend" memes that you fuckers DON'T actually want it and think it's annoying to be around. I TRIED dating men before and all it ever led to was multiple ghostings and heartbreak.
I would've done anything for a partner back then. I'd have quit my job and become a stay at home mom, sucked his dick as much as he wanted, or whatever. But it still wasn't good enough. Now I've put on like 40 extra pounds because of all the Cola and depression from being alone. And at 210lbs I SERIOUSLY doubt theres even a single Anon here that would even pity fuck me.
Men say they would fuck anyone, that they'd do ANYTHING for a girl no matter what. But I'm living proof that they're fucking liars who are volcels at best, and hypocrites at worst.

Correct. So you see, at least your brain is still working
<comment>
Men here are mad that I decided to be a lesbian
I don't even know who you are.
<comment>
Try looking like a proper woman (pic related) and maybe I'll consider it. 
Is not that hard
<comment>
You're right I would never date someone like you. You sound horrible.
<comment>
I would fuck you but only if I can lick your prosthetic leg

I joined a straight girls get yurified discord and this story is really how. How far how you gone in your lesbianism? Do you just say you become a lesbian? Did you kiss a girl, or cuddle, or even... >////&lt;

Even in your current state there is still an enormous legion of men thirsting for you. You're a female you never will experience what robots experience.

Back when they were having the gay marriage debate, one of the big points that I think won the moderates over was the idea that if you are gay, that you're born that way, and it isn't a choice. So I don't think you're really gay, I just think you're down bad. You should lose that weight though, it's unappealing to either sex, and you'll honestly feel better yourself without it. I hope you find someone OP.

You're underestimating my lust got fat women and the fact you can actually have a job, puts you miles ahead of a lot of the women here. I would 100% take you out on a date and see if we hit it off, if you lived near me anyway.

You should switch to coke zero. Zero calories. And it tastes better than regular coke imo. I did that while I was taking amphetamines and lost like 50 lbs.
Also, I love autistic women. I'm probably autistic in some ways myself, so I have a hard time even talking to women. The only woman I talk to in my life is my mom. All other women scare me.
<comment>
are you fat and smelly?
<comment>
I would date you if you were interested in men.
<comment>
forced yourself to into changing your attractions
Why would you do such a deeply mentally unhealthy thing if you are already so depressed? When men from here curse their loneliness, they do not forcefully change their sexuality to be homosex, as that is what jailed normalfags do. No, they instead explore fantasies of an ideal partner, and adopt devotion towards a waifu. And often times, this devotion even inspires personal growth and improvement. Why did you not merely seek out a husbando instead?

look at what people are posting in this thread. what did you expect to accomplish here?
<comment>
Don't bother, lesbians are deranged anon
<comment>
My standards are
virgin
not fat
not deformed
will have kids with me
If you want to be a lesbian then be a lesbian it doesn't bother me. That being said I would be fine with dating someone who only had one leg, I would be fine with dating someone autistic or mentally ill, although obviously it depends on how autistic and how mentally ill, there is a cut off.

OP is an amputee and autistic. Most robots could shower and that would fix their situation.
<comment>
Im an amputee, I lost my right leg
Stopped reading right there. I'm a footfag, not a charity department for your disgusting stub of a leg/foot. I wouldnt even let you clean my toilet bowl with your tongue if you paid me.
<comment>
I could love you, but your insecurities and doubt for fellow humans would probably cause you to question my motives and wonder why someone could ever love you. As has happened again and again
<comment>
Sounded pretty inviting until you mentioned you are fat, would have been fine with the rest.
<comment>
OP, can I see your pussy? Tits with a timestamp? Anything? I'd love you.
<comment>
I'd date you, but realistically we'd never meet. I'm a workaholic who's always at the airport and I go home and go to bed after that. So unless you're hanging out in a 120F uninsulated aircraft maintenance hangar in Florida you won't run into me.

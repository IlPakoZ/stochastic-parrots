My mom wants to make $2,000,000 in seven years by... selling hobby materials. I've always tried to be supportive of my parents but what the fuck.

She'll have to get them from China, in large bulk, and CHEAP. And even then, it's an easy business to do, plenty of other fish in that pond. Yeah it's not the greatest idea, but if she only invests what she can afford to lose, and would have a use for a shitload of crafting shit herself if nobody buys it, then I suppose it can be argued as better than doing nothing.
For people, of course, who have not learned the exquisite pleasure of doing nothing, absolutely nothing. Piss time away in great magnitude, there's too much of the fucking stuff boring me on the way to the grave. Still, got some of it out of the way now and it's been relatively painless since I became an adult and quit the horrible torture of childhood I try not to think about. Still get bad dreams though, fuckit, not my fault.
Anyway. Thing about Chinese traders is they are scamming bastards and will substitute any old shit if it saves them money. All sorts of people have been burned. You'll also get lots of traders and agents who claim they have a factory but really don't even have a warehouse, it's all drop-shipped from the real factory and they make a profit. There might be a book called "Doing Business With The Bunch Of Scamming Bastards They Call China (with free sewer oil!)", but it'd need to be an encyclopaedia. The Chinese actually see it as virtuous to rip off a customer if you get away with it. It's industrious! And if you can solve your problems by bullshitting til they give up exasperated, more the better, talk is free! In fact you can put robots onto it who speak English and lie better than your staff do.

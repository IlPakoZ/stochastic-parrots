So we all ended up here, what went wrong? Is it just ugliness or is there more to it?
I'm genuinely puzzled as to why I have never had a single friend or romantic relationship. Is it really all because I am hideous? If it's because I am a pussy or whatever, then what caused this? Why do normies not suffer from this?

I don't know about you but it's being horrendously ugly for me,no questions asked.Every girl that has seen my face avoids me if it isn't absolutely necessary. It's not even personality because I had a girl somewhat interested in me when we talked on internet but so bolted the moment she saw my face. Cant blame her because I am so fucking hideous. I am not even disfigured or meme tier ugly but like your stereotypical rapist villain that exists to make women uncomfortable. My own mother said I would molest my sister when she got angry once.

Yeah my own dad calls me ugly
stop taking everything here so seriously
How? I didn't have a social life before I even knew what 4chan was. It's not like this site ruined me. 
I have had trouble socializing in kindergarten and before. I think there is something fundamentally wrong with me. It can't be all looks right? Toddlers don't give a shit about that

what does it matter if I do. I will still be ugly, and he will also be ugly but with a wife because he's a boomer.

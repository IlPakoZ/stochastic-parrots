you wake up 
look like this
your room is pink
you love sweets and fashion
you are sweet to others and sensitive
everything else is the same.
WHAT DO?!!
I go to the park and find me a big man and give him lots of love uwu
Masturbate until i die from heart attack or dehydration or whatever.
I would be very happy. 
I could act as I always wish I could without judgement, sharing my feelings and self-expressing without judgement now that I'm a woman, and receive automatic sympathy for it.
It would be so nice.
I would definitely go back to school, hopefully to become a researcher.
while it's not exactly my aesthetic, it'd certainly be nice to have a young again with everything I know now. Might be hard for my gf tho since she's straight.

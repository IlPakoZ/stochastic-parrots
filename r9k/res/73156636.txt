however i am so used to 4chan since i have used it for a very long time, 
my only social media i use is steam an 4chan, i dont know where else to blog, i am ok with blogging on 4chan meaning i dont rly care , i used to blog for myself on your world of text , never shown anyone, it before as i was doing it when i first became hikki an did no human contact for 1.8 years i believe it was , dunno , i would still use that but it brings back very lonely memories , at least on 4chan there is a slight chance i will meet another human being that is not evil
make a neocities website!
i feel like playin some more oj so ehh i will
oh an i think youtube counts as social media i like youtube
bleh i could not get a lobby so im just gonna play more geometry dash instead 
it is very late to be fair but when i was playing all the time like 80+ hours every 2 weeks ppl almost instantly joined my lobbies an i got recognized a lot
hm well i have been gone for quite a while
woo i retried an got a lobby in oj
there is a few pins im missing in oj maybe ill binge the game until i have all the current ones
gonna have my 2nd monster of the night an continue playin oj
hopefully get my sweet breaker pin tonight
just 11 more sweet breaker games for my pin
i also wanna play as kril tho so maybe i will switch between them
Do you think maybe you should diversify your diet for your health? Are you overweight at all?
Nice job!!
I would send it to you if you posted a way
whats so bad about my health? i just got out of the dangerously underweight bmi range like a month an a half ago
i drink energy drink an i eat junk food but not so much, less than the average normie drinks coffee 
im still rly thin except for my thighs/butt/hips area are rly thick but i like that for the most part an is always been that way
thank u
u can add me on steam if u want if u wont abuse me
Mac and Cheese and Takis are junk food but it's okay in moderation I think. It's good to eat some fruit and veggies maybe. 
I'm about to sleep but if you post I will add you tomorrow
ehh ok i will just start ordering more vegetables then, when i first moved out i ate carrots an orange every day but i forgot to order more
i will just eat some strawberry rn while im playin oj

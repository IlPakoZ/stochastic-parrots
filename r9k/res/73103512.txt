Yes and yes

Yeah, she had huge tits but was crazy. I broke up with her since my family would've made fun of me forever for dating a fatty. Stil got to touch her big titties tho

You must be really really fat, Anautist.

I did, it wasn't worth it. Those who are physically fate are always also mentally fat.

i spoke with a fat chick yesterday it made me feel physically uncomfortable. why do fat people exist? why would they let themselves get to that point and not try to change whatever behavior was causing it?

I'm over 400 pounds actually. How did you know???
<comment>
Yeah I did for 5 years. Fucking miserable. Worst years of my life and I hated it. Don't do it, you will fall into a miserable depression afterwards when you realize your mistake. "Body positivity" is a disgusting fucking feminist lie

yes but their personalities are even more disgusting than their bodies
they're impulsive and constantly insecure
being a fat woman should be a crime punishable by death from firing squad

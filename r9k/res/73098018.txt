25 y o guy here. For about a month or so I've been feeling totally burned out and fatigued. Only just keeping up with my job. I eat pretty well, lift and generally get 10k steps a day in and take men's multivitamins and drink a spirulina smoothie every day. 
I think most of it is my job, but it's more mentally draining more than everything. I'm generally quite lonely too. Moved back in with my mom after I lost my previous job and live in the middle of nowhere. Quite lonely, no gf. My mental state is questionable. Constantly worried about money, keeping my job down, the state of the world, artificial intelligence (taking my job), being lonely for the rest of my life etc...
I get at least 7 hours of sleep a night and live a way more healthier lifestyle than the vast majority but I just feel exhausted all the time. It's just not normal for someone my age. I'm seeing a doctor to do blood tests but im just wondering what the fuck is going on and need some second opinions.
Could be autistic burnout or something m8
Im similar in I can function and make myself be productive but after a few days im just exhausted and then stay that way until I take a few days off to just recharge or something
Try taking a long weekend and dont force yourself to lift etc, just do what you want to to recharge 
If that helps then you need more me time in your life in general, give yourself like 30 mins a day to do just you shit, or take a couple days a week off etc 
Yeah its not as productive as all work all the time but when that shit just burns out your energy long term its not worth it
It's not surprising that you are exhausted. You poison yourself with spirulina smoothies, so you don't eat well. If you spend energy, you will have less energy left.
Your lifestyle IS the problem.

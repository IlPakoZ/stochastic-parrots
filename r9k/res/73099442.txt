It begins again.
I go outdoors and every girl looks super hot and I get depressed knowing I have no way to get them.
Such is the life of someone who is not networked at all. You can be around a million people but if there's no networks, you might as well be on a deserted island.

It's p. nice to go to a hotel room after a full day out at the beach with a girl you've been crushing on for a while.
<comment>
see cute girl
go up to her and tell her that you find her very cute
ask her to go out
go out, drink, fuck
It's really straightforward desu and the worst case is she says no because she has a bf or no time and you try again
<comment>
Did you just abbreviate the word, "pretty"?
<comment>
i love this time of the year because women get extra scared when im walking near them at night because of their clothing

Is this a joke? How tf do you use 4chan and this is how you view dating?
<comment>
tell me where I'm wrong?
<comment>
dude its just a bait
that person is clueless
<comment>
clueless
there are literally just 2 or 3 steps to approaching a girl and there are basically only 2 outcomes. one of which is objectively neutral and the other one is positive as it is the desired outcome. the stakes are low and the steps are easy, so where am I wrong?

True, why don't you make a network though? The number one commonality between all robots is that they have external locus of control, because they base their sense of identity on being an inevitable loser. Maybe stop seeing yourself as a loser and you'll stop living out this miserable self fulfilling prophecy

Knowing that somewhere out there there is probably a lonely incel looking at me in my sun dresses and thinking im cute makes me have hope.

Yea works real nice when ur 35 years old and 100% of women outdoors are too young AND staring at theirp hones with an angry look and listening to music
<comment>
Ur to young to understand
I was a socialite in school. Then ur suddenly 30 years old and you just sit alone at home and everyone you ever knew is gone or married
Then you have no idea what to do to become a high schooler again, surrounded by 300 chicks at all times
<comment>
damn that's crazy i didn't know that 35yo women don't exist i thought I was seeing them everywhere, i guess it was just very young looking 45 year olds or very old looking 25 year olds
<comment>
I mean that's just what happens when you get older. If you're well into your 30s and still think of the ideal life as being in school, then ofc that's not possible or even healthy. You need less strict definitions of success and happiness for yourself.

Anon life moves to fast
I'm just a 20-year-old who wasted 10 years of his life not progressing or developing socially and now I dont know how to live the life I'm expected to live at 30+
The mental state is not there
I cannot ask my brain questions about 30yo life when my brain isnt the brane of a 30yo
Dunno how to explain this to you, you'll most likely experience this disconnect yourself at some point. When people expect you to be a mature guy but you simply arent
<comment>
damn that's crazy i didn't know that 35yo women don't exist
There's no way I'm dating my own age at 30+. 
I'm already noticing how I look and act a lot younger than women my age. I've never looked better yet my agematch women are fat and look 50
Not really into raising someone else's kid either
<comment>
I know the feeling, but the severity of that issue for me is less severe. You need to intentionally mature yourself through experience and mentality. For men, especially if you aren't good looking and/or have a cute personality, there is no happy ending if you don't become mature and wisen up. A girl can make the most retarded life decisions and still have a happy ending so long as she is cute and/or pleasant. Guys don't have that luxury. It sounds like the big mistake you made was not getting a career itt since so much of adult life flows from that, meeting coworkers, naturally being integrated into adult circles, meeting a girl who can see a long term future with you, moving to the suburbs and having kids, meeting people your age in similar circumstances in whatever hobby you do. 
Most anons get 'left behind' in the disconnect between hs and college, but many also fall off between college and getting a career. I'm sort of falling into the latter trap atm, so trying to get a career so I can enter an adult life and have everything that comes with it. Living like a kid forever sounds appealing when you are one, but the older you get the more hollow it becomes imo. My priorities are completely different from when I was a kid, and I want to set myself up for a happy future instead of continuing to rot as I age with nothing to show for it.

Yeah I got no career whatsoever. Got a trade at 30 years old, nobody will hire me, and it's pretty much over. In hindsight I can see my social life was perfect in high school and college but when I dropped out it slowly faded away. Dropout life was fun for a while, I still had friends and contacted girls through social media
But theyre all gone now. I cant cultivate new women because I dont have networks. Do I literally start dm'ing random 18-year-olds on Instagram like every other 50yo crepe is doing? I now see why they do it
I've been toying with the idea of going back to college or even high school. I look young and most people wouldnt think I'm over 25 anyway
<comment>
Works if you're handsome and tall. If you're short and ugly women will look at you with disgust and fear the moment they realize you want to start a conversation

Cold-approaching James Bond style is the worst advice you could get online.

The only thing worse than going to college at 30, is going to college at 35. The truth is there's no guardian angel who is going to save your life, it's up to you. If you don't get your shit together, a career etc., then you'll be in a similar but worse situation in 5 years than you're in now. I'm now saying you'll fuck tons of girls in their prime, but if you get a career you should at least be able to get long term commitment from a decent woman. No girl wants to commit to a bum unless she's trashy as fuck itt
<comment>
Meant to say '*not* saying you will fuck tons of girls in their prime', but that was probably pretty clear from context
<comment>
be 35-year-old male
havent dated since your early 20s
every hot chick you encounter outdoors is like 18 and impossible to attain
Unappreciated pain
Also I dunno why I never see anyone hot who is over 25. I think they stop wearing tight pants and crop tops at a certain age
<comment>
You're missing one point here though. Going to college does in no way imply I'll get a career and fix stuff. Getting jobs isnt like in the memes where you just put your job boots on and get a job
I live in a small country and I'm an IT guy. I've applied for jobs for a full year and saw just how hard it is to land a job if you're not someone who's dedicated their entire life to IT. My resume is empty and I'd be on the underqualified side even with the college degree

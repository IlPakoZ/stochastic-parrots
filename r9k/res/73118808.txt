i have never had a job because parents did.t let me, so i also never had a car. Just been doing college and working on art. parents now want me to get a job and my drivers liscence and it has me silly anxious. does anyone know if there is a cope for unreasonable anxiety? its been getting waaay worse lately high blood pressure, cant sleep, cant eat, paranoia, hearing things etc.
for ref
I have always been mega anxious, like panic attacks when the teacher calls on me, when i make eye contact with people, etc. I have been doing meditation and working out for like a year and a half and its only a little bit better.

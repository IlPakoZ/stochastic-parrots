but that's not what i wanted to talk about. I learned a WEIRD lesson.
I got legally locked out of my career &amp; have been collecting neetbux through a payee who cuts my check &amp; puts half in savings.
I've learned alot about not stopping myself from spending money, isn't that SO WEIRD?
That when you WANT or NEED to spend money-and this is the lesson i learned-that it actually makes things easier?

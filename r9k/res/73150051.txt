normies and robots/incels are becoming one in the same
allow me to explain
be me, fairly normal guy
have friend group of 6 guys including myself
all very normal guys, smart, in education or working, not obese and most are tall
only 1 of us currently has a gf
one other had one for 7 years!!! and she dropped him to fuck a chad
being quite resistant to redpilling and alternative views in general whenever i bought them up
but recently have been a little more receptive
the guy that lost his long term gf even expressed some incel type opinions about women recently in a group setting and was not immediately shot down by the others
the state of women has blurred the lines between normie and incel 
being a well adjusted chadlite wont cut it anymore.
do you laugh or cry?
being a well adjusted chadlite wont cut it anymore.
This is not true in the slightest
People are waking up to how fucked up everything is, but by the time anything is done about it we will all be 40+

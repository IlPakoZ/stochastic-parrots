Why can't my mom accept that I'm a loser?
She's been forcing me to go to social events since forever.
Does she really think that I will change?

kek, just move out and be a loser alone. she does not want to see you be a loser, she will always insult you for being a loser as long as you live with her and be a loser. its a woman thing.

What do you have in your garden?
Oh, sorry to hear. Maybe make yourself a sandwich or some popcorn to get something in your stomach while still staying on the healthy-ish side.
love and sex
hate and pain
all things
and nothing
Animating stuff.
On the rare occasions that my scribbles actually move semi-fluently, it warms my soul. When I do a good job, I find myself playing back my stuff multiple times, amazed that I had made something so... adequate.
Ayyy, share some if yah can. We would love to see it.

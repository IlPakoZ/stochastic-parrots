Christianity is a religion that supports personal freedom.
Why do people say this? The idea that every individual has the right to say whatever they want, practice any religion they want, etc is a creation of the Enlightenment and has no basis in the Bible or the 1700 years of Christendom prior to the Enlightenment. Christianity used to burn homosexuals and atheists to death.

We're all sinners. All sins are equal (except racism and homophobia). The Bible says you're never ever allowed to judge. The Bible supports separation of church and state. The Bible says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God. That means masturbation is okay. I am very good at theology.

More so recognises. Most people choose to reject the gospel and go to hell. Most people don't trust in Jesus Christ's sacrifice alone for salvation and delude themselves (i'm a good person, i do X, how could God damn me?, etc).
13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
You seem to have something against my race. Thankfully God regards nations as less than nothing.

Most "Christians" these days simply identify as Christian because they were raised by Christians, so, given that most people are retarded, it's not surprising that they say retarded shit with no basis about Christianity.

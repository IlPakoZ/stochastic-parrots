What makes you so obsessed with me?
You could have me, but you chose not to, and instead to hate me - reflecting your own shortcomings.
I mean you're just now *barely* discovering what I've been instructing others to do.
Whether you want to admit it or not, you also need my guidance.
I do not hate you, I do not have any negative intentions toward you, as a matter of fact.
So what have you to prove?

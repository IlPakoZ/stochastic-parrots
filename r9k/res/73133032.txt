I've been a cute boy for my whole life, people have always told me I'm cute and about 2 months ago I decided to intentionally be as cute as possible and become a trap.
Ever since I have, people have been super nice to me for seemingly no reason. People mostly used to just ignore me like any other guy but now people unironically give me free stuff for no apparent reason. Today at work I was on break just standing around and a customer walked up to me and handed me $7 as a tip, no idea what for though since I was doing literally nothing lmao.
And thats just the tip of the iceberg too, once I made an out loud comment about candy someone had "oh that stuffs good i wish i had some" so they just gave me the entire freaking bag. Even online people have been gifting me games on Steam and I've never been gifted games before.
Is this what its like to be a girl?
Do they really just get free shit and attention for just fucking EXISTING??
And they COMPLAIN ABOUT IT???
Dudes, I'm never going back. I might troon out at this point.

People have been calling me cute too. Idk why. 
I asked them and they told me that it was because I am humble , have good eyes , pretty much caring and kind.
It definitely plays a role and now I just treasure everytime people call me cute and fantasize about it.

what is your plan when picrel happens?
I've been using this place less and less over the years so it probably won't affect me much itt
God damn that's an ancient meme
i wish i acquired anything lasting from all the time i've wasted here
yet i've got nothing to show for it
no online friendships/relationships, no hangouts, no one with similar interest
guess i'm just invisible, both irl and behind the screen
what is your plan when picrel happens?
shoot myself idk
I move on, I guess... There are tons of other online spaces out there that I can move to
That said, there's nothing quite like 4chan.

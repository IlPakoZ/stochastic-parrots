I have a lot of weird/bizarre stories that I think you guys would find amusing.

Do you got any about a creature in the woods attacking you?

Unfortunately no, but there are some woods/forest adjacent stories.
Ok so I'm going to start with the first one that came to mind. Back when I was attending elementary school since the first grade there was this one autistic kid that would act out the usual autismo routine. Pick your poison: prance around class; laugh at random intervals; sperg out about strange topics like elevator brands or the differences in cost of various types of paper towels. I happened to land in almost every class he was in and would happily observe what would he do next. Around 2003, when I was in the eighth grade, for some fucking reason the school decided it would be okay for him to be enroll in woodworking class.
So there I was, cutting wood with sharp as fuck saws as Timmy would zoom past me prancing around and blabbering on about the best cereal brand to choose from at the supermarket. Up until here everything's still pretty much ok, but a few weeks later after discovering autism boy would probably become an statistic that year, word gets around that he had become obsessed (as people in the spectrum often become) with a new subject.
That subject was the columbine school shooting.
Initially I brushed it off as being something like "Duuude the autistic kid is gonna like kill all of us bro he's gonna shoot up the school because he's so weird haha". That was before I was in the library one day and he was sitting using one of the computers (my school didn't have those site blockers for a long time) and I glanced at it and you can't make this shit up, he was looking at that fucking cctv footage image.
After that you can imagine the extent of my paranoia while having woodwork with him tripled. Well, eventually, one day, he was caught trying to steal a chisel and an old saw. Well he wasn't actually caught, he just stood up as the teacher was explaining something, copped them and tried to walk out of the room.

Now, you would think that whole obsession ends here, like oh he tried to steal some weapons because he was trying to plan a massacre (maybe? probably not). That was what i thought the instant the teacher "caught" him. However, what actually happened was autismo kid walked up to the teacher, as if to give him the tools, and, as the teacher was with his arm out, sperg boy grabbed it, pressed it onto the table and tried to start fucking sawing the teachers forearm. Luckily the kid was weak and thin as fucks so the teacher managed to push him away easily, but irregardless he had managed to cut somewhat pretty deep into the teacher's arm and I just remember some guy getting on top of lil Timmy and the teacher screaming and like half of the table splattered with blood. Some days later, the principal makes a statement about it and I never saw autism kid again. Some of my friends later in high school said they had seen him working at Target or something but I'm not really sure.

Now that I think about it. There was this other guy, now in high school, who would loiter around the back of the school and was always really moody and tried super hard to give out that loner, sad, nobody gets me type of energy. One day, for some reason, he tried to mug one of the female teachers while she was leaving the school towards the parking lot and IIRC people told me back then that he said some shit like "Give me your phone, money, everything or I'll fucking rape you, you whore". 
The dude was 5'5, chubby and didn't even make the *hand under hoodie so you know I have gun* trick, he just stood there. As such, the teacher ran back towards the school, told the staff, his shit was wrecked, got expelled and his family moved states.

Riding my way down the highway
No I won't rephrase 
politely
Crawl up my legs just to
Spite me
No I won't rephrase politely
Cause everyone's got a big deal now
I fought for this shit and its
Real now
And everyone's so out to bite now
It's carnage, it's carnage..
so do you want to look like a girl like her or fuck a girl like her
To run..
To crawl..
To find, my way home
what song lyrics are you quoting tonight anone?

Wrap me up in your best silk
I knew I was your best kill

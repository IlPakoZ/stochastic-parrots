Why even bother being apolitical?
Its the choice with the least effort and creates the least stress, I've watched normalniggers tear their lives apart over whichever goon of the week is holding the reins and its honestly sickening. Its especially bad when you realise that nobody in politics actually cares about average people over lining their own pockets and getting away with crimes that would have a lesser man executed.
politics is like a ghost created by society (which is also a ghost) to keep you from doing what you want. ghost in the sense it has no power and its completely imaginary bs
Join a union anon.
Unions are all democrats. Literally still picking a side.
mmh k, hope that empty island you live on treats you well.
they have the power, but im free as long as i dont treat them as powerful. i acknowledge their power, but if i wanted to kill someone, id find a way to bypass their power
Because your only two options are gay as fuck. How do we get Christian Authoritarian Nazi Incel Monarchy?
oh look it's pete seeger
it's like a fat guy crazy about sports and getting pissed whenever his side loses.
If you aren't enough of a influence to change society, why care?
Make your own way, retard
I tend to work as a hired gun, it's part of the job. Most of the time I am probably just paid to shut up and keep my opinion to myself.
Not really possible. You can ignore it, but not escape it.
I became apolitical once I realized everything is predetermined by the overton window.

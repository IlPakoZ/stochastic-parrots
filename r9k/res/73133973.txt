Dear guys that have never had a girl show interest in them, what are some things you would describe as female interest/signs of interest? I'm curious.

Eye contact, seeming to enjoy conversation with me, trying to keep my attention, messaging me first, etc.

Why are you asking us?
I guess smiling at me, catching glances, sitting near me when she doesn't have to, or starting a non-utilitarian conversation 
All things I haven't experienced

women aren't coy and anybody who thinks they are is short and ugly. if a woman is attracted to you she grinds on you, gropes you, propositions sex, etc. yes even the shy conservative studious nerd church girls do it. simple as.
the whole eye contact, smiling, catching glances, etc. is nonsense.

I just want to get an idea if you guys are out of touch or if women genuinely don't like you. Sadly, so far it does seem like women don't legitimately like you guys.
Nevermind, found the out of touch guy.

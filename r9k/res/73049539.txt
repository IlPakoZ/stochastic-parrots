Honestly I think the creators of dating apps should face some sort of consequence for what they have done to humanity
Anon wants to hurt dating app devs because he doesn't know how to take pictures or set up a profile
Honestly, I think that's the least of our concerns.
I already know there are places in hell for people who gaslight this stuff so whatever lmao
But have you actually ever taken a professional photo for your profile? Look at how much work women put into dating apps. You refuse to do the bare minimum
effort? pretty girls get photographs taken of themselves by people all the time for free, usually just the friends hanging out with them, i've never seen effort put into girls profiles it's all their fucking instagram photos anyway bro kill yourself
have you tried killing yourself?

Very loud, people jerking their bodies around, the music is not always good, I guess it's fun with a company or if your really like music. I went to a fucking restaurant alone once and workers kept giving me a strange look, could bet it's even worse if you go to a club all alone, tho if you become a regular this might stop.

I dont mind clubs but I dont really like them. Raves, festivals, concerts and pubs are much better.
I like the pregame shots and dressing up with my girls at the apartment before going out tho. Its the most fun part aside from drunk-dancing and eating mcd later on

Clubs can be pretty fun, I've found it either miss or hit, mostly miss. It's very obnoxious to see your loser stoner Chad friends line up ONS after ONS (which to be completely honest is what clubbing is a lot about)

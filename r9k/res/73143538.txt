Anyone here who still remembers this lady?
Everyone knows the black fembot rankings go
Coco chan
Iris
Kiki
Whoever OP picrel is
Lizzo
That kid from pol that killed her cousin and then herself
Miyoko
She wasn't a 4chan e-girl. Just a regular poster. Let's keep this thread alive long enough for someone who remembers her to come along.
Georgia Foid
You remember her?
qrd?
bump for black fembots
niggers are fucking disgusting the only non-white I'm willing to date is a ethopian godess
i feel so embarassed that i was in highschool when she was posting and i still visit this board all these years later fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
if picrel flirted with you you'd fold like a lawn chair.
You can lie to everyone but not yourself.
I find myself relating to her. I'm also a black fembot looking for a boyfriend :3
she's not even black. that's a lightskin with white admixture. she looks human in comparison to the gorilla op posted
easily the hottest black fembot to grace this board. damn 2015 was a while ago. still remember exchanging emails with her, she left this all behind and moved on. graduated uni, got a job in nursing, got a bf, etc. I'm glad she didn't stay on this shithole. she was always a comic/western cartoon nerd so she was bound to find her sweet basedboy funko pop collecting bf.
seconding. tell us the story
"Fembot" sure haha
It had nothing to do with /pol/ or here it just got posted there a lot. Little kids like 12 or 13 were playing with a gun on instagram live and the girl pointed it to her cousins head and accidentally pulled the trigger, she realized she fucked up bad so she shot herself in the head too all on live. Then a big brother or big cousin comes in and gives a good reaction meme.

She wasn't a 4chan e-girl. Just a regular poster. Let's keep this thread alive long enough for someone who remembers her to come along.

I find myself relating to her. I'm also a black fembot looking for a boyfriend :3

she's not even black. that's a lightskin with white admixture. she looks human in comparison to the gorilla op posted

Coco chan
easily the hottest black fembot to grace this board. damn 2015 was a while ago. still remember exchanging emails with her, she left this all behind and moved on. graduated uni, got a job in nursing, got a bf, etc. I'm glad she didn't stay on this shithole. she was always a comic/western cartoon nerd so she was bound to find her sweet basedboy funko pop collecting bf.

It had nothing to do with /pol/ or here it just got posted there a lot. Little kids like 12 or 13 were playing with a gun on instagram live and the girl pointed it to her cousins head and accidentally pulled the trigger, she realized she fucked up bad so she shot herself in the head too all on live. Then a big brother or big cousin comes in and gives a good reaction meme.

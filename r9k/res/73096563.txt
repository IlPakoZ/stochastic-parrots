Having a gf is not guaranteed sex
Is there at least a decent chance at some cuddling happening?
Not in America anyways.
If you're more than 1 month into a relationship and she hasn't fucked you then you're either dealing with a crazy religious chick or she flat out doesn't like you.
Only nutless men or men with no game think or would ever accept this. I swear I feel like most liberal men in relationships like this are either low T or self hating.
Yeah. That's more likely
I see her about twice a week and have sex half the time typically. I can only see it decreasing as time goes on
Sex is awful.
No doy, dumb dumb
with you yeah
Having sex does not guarantee a gf
Honey, please don't do this in front of my friends.

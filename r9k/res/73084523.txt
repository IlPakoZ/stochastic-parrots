if it makes you feel better they ditched the FAMAS for the HK416, in part because the FAMAS turned out to live on subsidies and one unit costing the same as three German rifles.
the og f1 famas is by far the best looking rifle in history only second to the afghan ak74, the 416 or really any ar variant is but the rifle equivalent of an incel
it's by design retard
when you see and hear it shoot only 2 bullets you know it's time take cover and reload instead of going for another shot, needlessly exposing yourself
i like the type 89 and the acr but the famas is pretty cool
oi m8 u got a loicense for writing "license"??
Fellow autistic person here a surprised ot see this here and not on >>>/k/ 
M-16 originally came with 20 round mags as well.
FAMAS is too awkward to have a longer mag, it would throw it off balance.
French navy used the G2 FAMAS, which uses 30 round STANAG mags. I'm sure it works fine. RIfle balance is not so touchy that it's thrown off by either the weight or length of five extra rounds in a magazine.
l stand corrected

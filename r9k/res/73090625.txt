I have a friend who wants to commit suicide over not having a gf and being an incel. If he were to leave a note to his only family member stating why he committed suicide, would they think he's pathetic? That friend isn't me btw
<comment>
yes, to leave a note means he loves life too much
<comment>
He does love life though. He just cant deal with the pain and loneliness anymore
<comment>
why would you kill yourself because you dont have a gf? i dont have a bf and yes, it hurts, but im not gonna KILL MYSELF over it... anon, reevaluate.
<comment>
this is something ive been considering too. I think ideally I want it to seem like an accident
<comment>
Because you know you can get one whenever you want
That makes more sense
<comment>
I'm starting to realize the only thing ruining my life is other people. I'm fine on my own, I'm satisfied with things, but I always see you people crying all the time and making scenes and saying you'll kill yourself over this and that. Makes me feel bad, like I'm missing out. But when I'm on my own, I'm satisfied with what I have, and if I don't have it well that's it I guess. All I have to do is stop going on 4chan or social media, and you fags are gone, I can just live a happy comfy humble life. The problem was right under my nose all along.
<comment>
you can get one whenever you want
hypothetically yes i could... but realistically? yeah no
whats stopping you from getting a girlfriend?
<comment>
It is pretty pathetic to be unable to complete a basic societal and biological task.
<comment>
Tell your friend to become gay, its easier to find a boyfriend
If hes desperate enough to kill himself, hes desperate enough to get assfucked
Your friend can even cuddle afterwards
<comment>
the only pain and loneliness one experiences from aloneness is self inflicted
<comment>
I just wish I could stop caring. I've made a conscious effort to, tried SSRIs, tried everything that's meant to numb the pain of being a genetic deadend yet it still consumes me. I don't know what to do either
I am deformed
I don't mean that part. I mean being pathetic for not being stoic enough
<comment>
No, he's deformed and not gay
<comment>
Here it is once again, that weird faggotry. "Stop caring" "genetic deadend". Why are you like this? Obviously I'd be happy to get a girl, but I also realize it'd be a lot of obligations and problems. So I don't go for it. I don't need to have it. There are other things in this life. Countless other things. And this mindset that the endgoal of life is breeding is so retarded. A beast thinks like that not a human. "b-but we're animals too!" Go live like them then. It's insane I just can't stand you people. Whining all the fucking time and ruining the good mood of others. The worst part is it's no longer quarantined on /r9k/, you fags start posting that shit everywhere now.
<comment>
Gays are degenerates, your friend will still find some dude to fuck his deformed ass
<comment>
the problem is being surrounded by other people who are hopelessly addicted to social media and who model their behavior by the dictates of google algorithms
<comment>
At this point I'm gonna have to escape to the woods to get away from it all. I'm seriously considering it. Just staying there until I die of old age. All everyone does is complain all the time.
<comment>
I'm happy for you if you're happy
How so?
<comment>
Yes. What "they" do doesn't matter. Sex isn't worth dying for, much less heroing.
<comment>
That friend isn't me btw
kek. giving people reasons to live and why kys is dumb LIVE right now on one one and only kick.com/leafy is here for your consoling
<comment>
You just have to get off the internet
It's not really about the sex doe. It's more about not being able to get over the hand he's been in dealt in life
<comment>
How does being a cum socket for someone you're not attracted to not pique disgust in someone?
<comment>
you can easily get an ugly boyfriend who you don't like and who treats you badly. that's better than being an incel
<comment>
They would think it was a terrible tragic waste, especially if he was relatively young. And they would be right.
<comment>
Nice strawman, white knight
<comment>
you have problems with language comprehension i see
<comment>
How old is your friend? He sounds young
<comment>
Ugly women don't have to find ugly bfs. They can date average and above men who'll treat them great and love them. A disabled deformed woman has her pick of 1450 men for God's sake
<comment>
How so?
i can only assume you've never meditated. but just imagine for a moment what a monk is experiencing while he meditates. he's simply accepting the present no matter what it is, with no expectations on how it should be.
he experiences pain because he feels like he should have a gf/friend/attention whatever it is, not because his actual experience is painful.
<comment>
Do you think humans choose what to desire?
<comment>
depends on wording.
directly stating that you are killing yourself specifically because you cant get laid or get a gf is pretty pathetic. stating that you feel lonely and just cant seem to find emotional connection with anyone might just convince like one or two people that loneliness is real and horrible. wouldn't change the world tho and no matter what some lonely loser puts in his note his death will be as meaningless as his life.
<comment>
How would it be a waste?
He is 23
<comment>
I read your thread OP and it's over for you, sorry. The sooner you accept it, the better. The only thing left for you to do now is cope and rot in peace, maybe try making some incel friends to alleviate the loneliness a bit?
<comment>
you are braindead and deserve to be alone
<comment>
I guess it's more to just give closure to someone who cares but I think it's not much in the grand scheme of things anyway so it's probably just better when you don't leave a note
Yeah, it all feels like an effort. A prodigious amount. Every morning I wake up and it feels like I woke up from a hangover, I'm always tired, I go to a job I hate but hey, it's a great career I'm meant to be grateful for and then I come home to nothing. Not a single sign things will change so I think it's best to just end it instead of continuing the suffering for another 30-40+ years
I'm not sure why narc women even come to these threads to tell us we're ugly and blah blah blah when we already know this shit

if that's how you feel, personally im too much of a pussy to end it, but a great number of my incel friends are no longer here, and i dont feel very happy at all so im just doing drugs until my body gives out and i die.
<comment>
What drugs do you take now?
<comment>
coz they are narcs like you said

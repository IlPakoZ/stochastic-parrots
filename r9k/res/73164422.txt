I need help in something, maybe those in drugfeel could help me understand my current state of mind after quitting weed. I used to smoke weed almost every day at night 2 hours before going to sleep, during this time I got a girlfriend and I kept smoking without letting her know at all. 4 days ago I decided to quit and gifted it all to my friends, but now I have a pressing conflict in my head; im no longer attracted to my girl, nor to I feel any love towards her. Could it be that the weed manipulated/changed my brain chemistry in such a way that it made me socially adept enough to get a girlfriend and also to be attracted to her? What should I do? I know that if I breakup with her she will either kill herself or change into a very bad person for herself and those close to her.

It's been 4 days bro. Of course your brain chemistry is adapting. Wait 2 months without any weed and then see.

I sincerely don't know what happened to me since 2019
not a single idea behind those eyes
My life is a blank since 2019
I have a dissociative disorder
In 2020 there was a global pandemic. Because of this, everyone was basically forced by law to go inside.
This was a great detriment to many people's mental health. Almost everyone went downhill mentally.
If 2020 doesn't feel like it was 3 years ago, it's because time dilates when you do the same things every day. Your brain kind of measures time with certain "epochs" (like the weather changing) and certain important events, when you remove that everything just kind of becomes a blur.
I have a dissociative disorder and have had psychotic episodes and mental hospital stays.
I was under the delusion I was persecuted too
I have been working inside an office space since Mar. 2020. I watched the world cower and break. And I let it happen
neither do we
go to sleep

I hurtle through Space and Time. The light of the stars blinding me. The Pain of the Past powers me on. The Loss of Her is almost unbearable when I stop. I must only charge forwards, onwards and onwards forever. 
There is no going back. 
In this moment, I am a god. In this moment, I am Eternal and Unbreakable. 
I will die on this Nofap, like I should have done in 2020. I was never supposed to make it this long.
Might as well join in.
Maybe this'll help with the receeding hairline.
Good luck to you, brother. I'm on my 121st day.
Starting over today, I lost everything due to my degeneracy, idle hands is the devils playground I have hope though for me and all the other anons doing this. Im gonna study for ccna and learn and instrument
Congratulations, if I may ask, what do you do with your free time?
Godspeed.
Which instrument are you considering?
if I may ask, what do you do with your free time?
Browse the Internet. Watch TV/films. I'm a NEET so I barely ever even leave my room. It can be done, it's just harder.
Tfw lost a bet with my female friend and now I'm in involuntary nofap as I am actually locked up in a chastity cage until the end of the month
You wouldn't believe how desperate I am right now. Fuck.
Did she lock you in it?
What's so great about not jerking your cock for sperm?
I seriously don't understand, there appears to be no benefit to it yet you believe it's spiritually rewarding and healthy.
Considering guitar at the moment and maybe learn a DAW as well just need outlets in general or else you will keep succumbing to fapping. My longest streak was 3 months and it was honestly life changing but I came back to this website and it has been downhill ever since.
appears to be no benefit

I love space and I want to visit local planetarium to watch documentaries about space, but nobody ever goes there and I will be looking really weird coming there and making workers boot up a whole cinema hall for me alone.
<comment>
So shoot yourself instead of seeing a movie. Problem solved. All your problems solved, actually. I'm so brilliant.
<comment>
I would go with you, anon! I wish I had someone to go with me too. The one near me does a relatively decent trade, I'm just scared of going in public alone because people laugh
<comment>
I've never been to something like that, but I'm someone who prefers to just stay inside and watch documentaries. Sorry I can't be a bro and help you, fren.

They used to take us to planetarium once or twice a year in middle school, and while it was fun, I also got to mess around with display telescopes, but the place felt sad, it was obvious that nobody goes there except for middle school classes for school to get money for extra education from government or whatever.
<comment>
That is quite sad. Middle school was never really fun for me, ours was a shit hole that was overcrowded and we never actually had any field trips. What kinds of stuff do you love about space, fren?
<comment>
What are your favorite images from the Hubble and the James Webb telescope?
<comment>
What do you think of this picture of space?
<comment>
Do you like this one of space?
<comment>
Nothing specific, I like everything about it, but what amazes me the most is when I'm reading about something extra big or something really bad taking billions of years to happen I'm shocked at first, but then I remember that I won't live that long, humanity won't live that long and I remember that in terms of Universe, nothing really ever matters. It's very Zen.
<comment>
Ah, I see. I'm sure you find the concept of the Bootes void pretty neat then, right? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C3%B6tes_Void space is just a nice frontier to conquer, the final frontier(although it is comprised of multiple frontiers in reality). Post-scarcity, potential alien life, etc. all awaits out there too.

Same with me, but I have no interest in space shit. Looking up the site for that planetarium, it specifically states it's not open to the public, just school field trips, outreach, etc. There's also the largest planetarium in my state that is open to the public, but it's also part of a larger science building that we also had a field trip too since you can interact with most things.
<comment>
Don't worry anon, I have my own VPN, I'm just fuckin' around.
Also another kind of documentary and one I really loved as a kid https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVjYtZydMuo [Embed]

Yes, I'm jealous for people that will live thousands of years later, having technologies that will allow to truly live free from any kind of tyranny. Don't like the climate, regime, locals, religion, local nature, anything? Just move to the other planet. And it will never end like it did with Americas, because space is endless!
Nice, didn't know it's on YT, going to watch it right now.

Humanity won't survive once people try to colonize space or another planet. If China gets there first, the rest of the world attacks. If the USA gets there first then China, Russia, etc. will all attack. It'll be a WW like nobody has ever seen before.
<comment>
No. Politics is politics, money is money, but space is where grudges are forgotten and efforts are combined. ISS exists for a reason.
<comment>
Having a space station isn't the same as colonizing and living on another planet. China will want to claim it as it's own while making communism the planets religion. Muslims will want it to be the paradise for their people. Russia will want to take it as their own. You underestimate just how fucking retarded the world leaders are. You really think they won't go to war over the chance to rule an entire goddamn planet? They go to war over stupid shit all the time.
<comment>
Maybe, but at the moment space colonizing will be possible people, not countries, people will gain ability to get away from all this. Let countries fight. Pilgrims will just move away and live their lives far away, like they did once.
<comment>
How are they going to move there without trasportation? The world's elites will be the first to flee because they have the power and money to do so. More realistically is the poor will obliterate themselves for their country like always even though they had no chance of leaving Earth in the first place. The world's elite aren't going to want a bunch of drug addicts, homeless, poor, and other "undesireables" on a new planet. It would also give them the chance to finally setup their NWO/OWG type shit. If anything colonizing a new planet is just awful for everyone that isn't the world elite.

normals are soulless husks anon
you should go
it isn't your fault that they are too lazy to do their job
you're simply too nice to want to impose
space is cool
<comment>
You're just a doomer and expect the very worst.
<comment>
I forgot how amazing Carl Sagan was
<comment>
I expect what has been shown throughout history already.
<comment>
no anon you need to get out of your head!
the workers will probably be very glad to see you! to see someone being interested in this, it is also their job to do it so it really shouldnt be a sweat for them.
<comment>
I don't see how that'd be the case. It kind of seems like you're uninformed with geopolitics even, if I'm honest. All of those powers have agreed to not have space be nationalized/exploited for a reason and although they compete for prestige in space it is almost certainly going to be private individuals, not beholden to those agreements and whose allegiances are weak at best with their state, who start the industrialization of space.
The only scenario that I could see that would cause something like that to happen is if one of those states started trying to make the "rods of god" project a reality.
<comment>
That's their job, anon. It's not that weird desu
<comment>
Yes because countries have never gone back on their word or anything. China and NK who wants to know and control every little thing their citizens do would never lie to others. The people that really rule the world would definitely never want to have an entire planet under their control or anything.
<comment>
China and NK aren't the ones in charge and given China's demographics they never will be. China's #1 trading partner is the US, China is making itself even more reliant on fossil fuels from both the US and Russia and Russia itself is burning through its demographics faster than China. It's pretty well in alignment for the US(who dominates geopolitics still, whether you want to believe it or not) to allow for private businesses to further our reach into space. All of these politics are decided by risk versus reward and there is plenty of rewards to be had by joining in that exploitation instead of being a retard and fighting to monopolize it, an action which would quickly sour affairs with the entire rest of the planet.
<comment>
still ignoring the powers that be that actually rule the world
Maybe you'll realize it if you live long enough to see the OWG/NWO come to the forefront completely and not just stay in the shadows.
<comment>
They prescribe you olanzapine yet? You should take it.
<comment>
Not an argument. Thanks for admiting I'm right. I accept your concession. Filtered. Now reply to me when I'll never see it.
<comment>
Not an argument.
Neither is asspulling NWO shit, schizo.
Now reply to me when I'll never see it.
Yeah, sure buddy. Here's another (You).

I think I've reached the point where suicide is the only option. I've lived with this since my late teens, 20 years later I still have them. I feel like I've been "coping" all these years, staying alive for everyone else. There are so many things totally out of my control &amp; beyond help. I just don't think I can last much longer. I wish my life hasn't gone in this direction but I'm exhausted &amp; ready to go. The only reason I'm still here is for everyone else. I'm just tired &amp; I'm not willing to place this burden on my loved ones. I've gone to them before &amp; I know it has taken its toll. I'm don't want to drag them down anymore. I just want to be free of this body. I don't have a plan, I just know someday it will all be too much.

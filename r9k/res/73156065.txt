<comment>
Based dad. Stop dressing up like a whore, cunt. Get back to studying and working.

its not even a revealing cosplay it was just for fun
why would he want it to jack off and burn? i sent my friends pics of it and they all said it was fine and hes acting crazy
<comment>
and yeah im a virgin why does that matter?
<comment>
because you not being a virgin is evidence of being a whore. Im not familiar with the character but I believe she is seen as a sex symbol, some would automatically deem it as inappropriate regardless if the outfit was slutty or not. I bet your step dad jerked off to Lola a few times which might explain the explosive reaction.

it sounds like his problem if he has a kink for a cartoon
its a cosplay and he needs to get over it
it wasnt cheap either so idk wtf is wrong with him

 I'm a virgin, teehee
Stop lyin', bitch. Oh wait, you a "double-pussy penetration-virgin", right? That kind.

Alright, I anon, will add you ( assumedly young female due to living in a situation that would alot your step father to control your behavior so strongly ) in order to attempt conversation ( and possible relationship building, as since you, OP, have piqued my visual curiosity since you have described yourself as a cosplayer of slightly racy but still not distasteful cosplay that well adjusted, romantically available women likely enjoy to wear )
<comment>
no im not a double pussy penetration virgin ive never had sex cuz i havent found someone i want to have it with
and to the guy below that creepy message u can add me if u want
<comment>
dont let anyone from here groom you lmao. Your best move is to speak with your mother and get her to speak with your step-dad. Especially if this is his only outbrust it will blow over. In the future just avoid sexaul/sexaulised characters.

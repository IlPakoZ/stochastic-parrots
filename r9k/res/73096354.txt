What would you think if a guy only had buttsex with you?

You can just tell this is the high point of her life.

My gf is anal only, aside from the occasional blowjobs. I still let her masturbate sometimes with a toy but I haven't entered her pussy in almost three years.

Your idea or hers?

My idea, and it took a little convincing. Don't want babies but also birth control is poison is the main reasoning given. It started with anal every now and then, eventually told her it's my favorite hole, tighter, etc.. Then one night I felt bold and made it official. At first she would want vaginal and bring it up sometimes during foreplay. I'd have to reinforce the new dynamic but eventually she just accepted it. If it starts with oral and she stops because tired or whatever she grabs the lube or gets prone. I like her casual acceptance of things like this. It meant going below my looksmatch and I'm the only income earner but it makes up for things well enough. I was never a playboy or all that popular with women so it's kind of neat not just having a gf but also sexual exclusivity for my pleasure alone. Before this she'd sometimes try to refuse sex when all I wanted was a vaginal quicky. I think being used anally changes a person and imprints upon them in a way. She's a much better gf for it after we made it anal only, which seems counterintuitive because now she's presumably getting less out of it.

She gets less, but gives more.

be me
25 yo kissless virgin, not too bothered by it
go to sleep
have vivid dream about a girl I thought was cute back in school
nothing sexual, she just leans on me and kisses me but it feels very intimate
suddenly wake up
mfw
How do I shake this feeling off? Do I need to start drinking alcohol?
you need to meet more cute girls who can be in pleasant dreams
You're in your 20s. you can still go to anime/comic/video game Conventions
you can join college clubs. Like a hiking board game or video game club

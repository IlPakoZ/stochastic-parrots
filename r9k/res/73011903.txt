Is 22 years old too late to start courting alt-girl/goth girls? Kissless virgin btw
<comment>
yeah because you aren't in highschool anymore so there are no more goth girls

no its not too late, only the non poser goths exist past the age of 22... kissless virgin isn't a bad thing to us as long as you're not lame and socially retarded. maybe hit the gym and find an interesting hobby, build some charisma and you wont have a hard time with the goth chicks. Godspeed and best of luck.

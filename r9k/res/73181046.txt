it's probably just cope but i don't know money is going to make me happy enough for me to devote myself to trying to get a second chance to interview again
Where do you want to live after cashing out?
A villa in Montanna?
i don't think i'm "cashing out" any time soon but idk somewhere safe and has easy access to everything and don't need to drive
Don't need to drive in Tokyo
and if you get vacation time it would be a great trip
but living there is completely different no?

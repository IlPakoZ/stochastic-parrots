neetbros, what is a good job for us to get out of neetdom? janitor? what else?
<comment>
The trades will give u fulfillment and you can eventually make like 50 bucks an hour depending on what you pick
<comment>
No, I'm too retarded and too much of a pussy for trades. I wish there was more data entry jobs near me but that's not the case

I'm thinking of being a janitor too. Would be cool if my coworkers were all ex NEETs
Which ones aren't too social?

Off-hours janitor, stock shifts, overnight security, truck driver, landscaper. Most of them pay pretty well. Bonus if you get cert for first-aid and forklift, anyone can get those and they give you more options. You can also check temp labor agencies and try to get picked for odd jobs they need people for, like setup/teardown for events or construction cleanup.

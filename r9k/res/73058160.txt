This is a shitty little thread for things I'm doing in my own life that other anons might also appreciate thinking or seeing or reading, it's basically a bunch of rule I'm experimenting with that are sort of like a "dopamine fast" but without the pseudo-scientific naturalism angle. These are just things I'm experimenting with doing because it's how I did things in the past when I was a stupid kid and not an adult. 
I greatly respect you for doing all this, Anon.
More people should be like you. In fact, I might try some of the things you've listed here.
There were some other things I initially wanted to add but I haven't gotten a chance to practice them for myself
Like one of my favourite old games is Paper Mario, but I've played it so much when I go to play it now I find myself mashing through dialogue and skipping parts of it etc. So I want to do a playthrough where I don't just read but read aloud the dialogue in character voices for instance, you know really engage with it. Other things include inviting friends over and actually making an effort to host them, like make food and invite them to watch the game rather than just shoot the shit doing nothing.
yeah, back when i still bothered to talk to my ''friends'' if i called i'd time out into voicemail and get a text like 20 minutes later of them wondering why i didn't just text.

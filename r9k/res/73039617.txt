why does my brother always try to delegate chores onto me? he wants me to help take care of his dogs (i hate animals) and do tasks that people ask him to do. should i stop? it makes me angry desu. he is in his room playing video games theres no reason he cant do this stuff.
once i asked him to drive me to the gym and he would not do it. he doesnt ever reciprocate

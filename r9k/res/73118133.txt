how does that make me a right-winger?
It makes you a faggot who will never feel a woman's touch, that's for sure
just like right-wingers use "leftist" or "communist" as an insult, there is the opposite tendency on the left, calling anything they don't like "right-wing" or "conservative". I'm as left as you can get, and yet I've been called a conservative and a prude among other things.
They assume you're pro-life because obviously you couldn't just find the joke distasteful or bad for discussion. The cynic in me wants to assume they also didn't view you as left-wing because they assumed you got upset on behalf of to-be-aborted babies.
Depends on where you are. Normally, this wouldn't place you anywhere on the left-right spectrum. But if you're from the US, then I'm sorry: you are de facto rightwinged for this bullshit. With various states passing laws that can LITERALLY charge you with homicide now, you are tacitly endorsing that bullshit but getting upset over some girl's joke about it. And I really hope someone strangles you for it.
There are few things in life that are extreme and black-and-white, abortions in the US have grown to that point.

i got you.
so it comes to your image and how people perceive you. People like to think that they have a say in it, but in reality its hard to achive.
There are things that people do that actively allude to a perception a image that they poke you with subtly with every conversation every post every interaction etc etc. "all is a performance" is better suited, people dont post their trip to dubai because they want to show people they were in Dubai, but to show that they lead a certain lifestyle (only thing i could really think of)
its the same when it comes to how people carry themselves talk and act, its all human behavior and subconscious signalling.

It's not particularly deep even though it is. Nurture your ego, but don't feed it. Sounds like you could benefit from Eastern philosophies like Taoism and Confucian schools of thought. Regardless you have straight up porn saved to your phone/hard drive from your OP pic, delete that shit. Porn is vanity.

nothing is real anymore if it's all just thoughts trapped in me

Is it bad though? 
I mean, that's just how humans are, a few modafuckers manage to freaking land on the moon with an ape brain designed to pick the right color of bananas, and they may have done it out of vanity, so what?
Humans do amazing things, save other amazing people and also do terrible but amazing shit out of looking good, the sense that vanity is bad is just biased, not a bad thing by itself.

You owe it to your higher self to have a firm grasp of objective reality. You don't want to lead yourself into delusion and overly magical thinking when you want enlightenment.

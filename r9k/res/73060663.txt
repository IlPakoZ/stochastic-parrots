Is there a word for not being interested in being romantically involved, monogamous, or in love with women but still being sexually attracted to them? 
I am not gay. I am attracted to women. But I do not like them. I am interested in only sex, with either escorts or sugar babies, and that's it. I cannot view sex without it being transactional, and I cannot be fwb with any women because I'm not interested in being friends with a female. 
How do I even explain this to a third party if simply asked? Just say I'm single? I don't view myself as a MGTOW, as I will always actively sexually pursue at least one female at any given time, but that's it.

you are dumb. And it you recognize that this answer does not fall in-line with acceptable answers, it's because you asked the question like a retard.

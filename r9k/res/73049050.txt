i was a 32 year old khv last week with 2 parents
now i'm a 33 year old khv with 1 parent
and soon you'll be a 34 year old with 1 wife
doubt i'd move that fast into marrying someone
don't come back to /r9k/ until you have a wife
need to date at least 5 years before marrying or she doesn't genuinely love you.
get married with a prenup after one year and get divorced after 4 if it doesn't work out
Sorry for your loss and the bad timing, as though there was a good time.
It's gonna get worse. Your challenge is to lose the khv label before you have 0 parents.
Get to it, bucko.
i hope to have a loving partner and a few good friends before the next one goes cause otherwise i'll just be alone with my thoughts

 be me
 have this stupid joke I pull every time I talk about my brothers
 It usually goes something like "I have two and a half brothers, yaknow one of em doesn't have any legs"
 Be me like a month ago
 Pull it on a non-native speaker
 They stare at me with a shocked face and go like "Oh my god I am so sorry how did it happen that must be awful :(((( I'm sorry"

Why do you need friends?
<comment>
You don't "need" them in (current year), but it's nice to have them. Can be a source of emotional/mental support, fulfillment, and aid during rough times.

Because humans are not biologically programmed to live without them. Friendship is one of the requirements for optimal physical and mental health.
You cannot live if your health is less than perfect, so you need friends.

What makes you say that?

Mental support / human condition is the only thing that comes to mind.
In this economy maybe financial support too if you share an apartment

We evolved living in large tribes where everyone helped each other. The tribe took care of each other.
Nowadays, one person has to do everyone on their own. It's no wonder everyone is exhausted all the time, we're not built for this kind of lifestyle.

For survival. Groups of people tend to do better than individuals. In my limited knowledge of the subject that's why Cro-Magnon died out even though they were basically hardier than Homo Sapien.
Aside from that though, there's no real benefit to having friends.
In today's day and age, the average person has an unhealthy attachment style, and will do whatever they can to stave off the progress of their friends if they themselves aren't going to directly benefit from whatever is happening. 
If you want friends because you're lonely, or you want emotional support, then that's a really bad way to get those things.
The truth is that most friends only know how to appear as caring and concerned relations in a superficial way, if you get really into it, they're actually quite bad at supporting other people.
Most people won't even be honest about things when directly questioned, let alone cluing in an ignorant person about something they should be working on or fixing

What is the difference between that and a robot/animal? Never achieving a modicum of awareness/sentience of their existence and the universe as they follow their impulses consistently with success. I am not here to say that I necessarily live better than them for knowing, but I wonder why people value free will so much if happiness can be achieved with hard constraints. It makes me question the validity of happiness itself. Why should it be a motive when it is mere neurotransmitters and fated faggotry? So claimed free will advocating be happyfags are btfo by these (for a lack of a better term) npcs

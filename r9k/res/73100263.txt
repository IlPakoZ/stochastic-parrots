If it was 100% proven that God doesn't exist and there is no afterlife
I would do whatever I want to whoever I want 
Why does it matter if they have to suffer for a while? 
They will die eventually and the suffering will stop after death
yes? thanks capt obvious
Godfags already claim suffering ends after death if you're not a murderer or gay.
There are unironically who think like this except the justification part.
that would require you to be a psychopath.
also you would get in trouble if you did what you want without thinking about consequences
you fail to see that god is another barrier of thought/action, like society/prison, it is just something made by your mind to keep yourself from acting on your desires, making them simply ghosts. if those ghosts are destroyed, you can be free to do whatever will bring you the maximum comfort and pleasure possible
if everyone just cared about themselves thats the opposite of what you'd get.
how so? if a person feels a desire to kill me they are allowed to, but if i want to live i may act on my best interest and defend myself
yes. do you lack the ability to see further? having to defend yourself is already bad. it would be everyone against everyone and you would not have any of your things like electricity and computers because they rely on us working together.

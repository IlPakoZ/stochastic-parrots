Height really isn't as big of a deal as you guys make it out to be. Before I get called a coping manlet, I'm a girl, yes an actual biological girl, who's about 5'1 or so.
Now let's get the obvious out of the way; shortness is obviously not ideal in a man. Although the specific heights vary globally, in pretty much every culture taller men are preferred over shorter ones. Short men are definitely at a disadvantage in the dating scene. If you had two men who were identical in personality, money, and facial attractiveness but one was shorter than the other, the taller guy would win out.
That being said, the idea that if you're a short guy you should just rope or transition is pure incel retardation. This rhetoric really only makes sense when applied to online dating, and even then not really. Short guys who are upfront about their shortness on tinder are not gonna get shat on for being short. It's only a problem if you state you're 6'2 and you're actually 5'7. Lying like that is dumb. If a woman lied about being 120 pounds, meanwhile she's actually 200 pounds, you guys would be pissed. And understandably so.

But while we're speaking about online dating; it is one of the most obnoxious and detested markets by younger generations. It feels artificial, isolating, and weirdly commodified in how it treats people as these shiny products you can flaunt to others. Plenty of people out there are sick and tired of the dating market. Plenty of women out there who are nonwhite, fat, bald, etc have expressed their frustrations at rejection on dating apps. 
Before you say "but someone will still fuck them" you have no idea how women work. Society finds women who've had little sex most desirable, in the same way society finds men who've had lots of sex most desirable. There is no benefit in women throwing themselves at horny strangers on the internet who want to pump and dump them. We want actual connection, not being used as a living fleshlight and abandoned.
Anyways back to short men. Yes it is something that will stunt your desirability in the grander picture. And yes, very few people are going to activrly *seek* out short men in the same way they do tall men (although they do exist-- some women prefer men who are near their height because it's less troublesome and some have shota fetishes). That being said, women who will shut you out because of your height are not the norm. Very few girls are going to say "oh you know I think you're really attractive and we mesh together really well but you're three inches shorter than me so fuck off". Like c'mon guys.

Cool story, foid. This isn't going to make the manlets any more content with their objectively inferior lot in life.
<comment>
I wasn't going to call you a coping manlet, I was going to call you a larper, which you are. I'm not reading all that text.
<comment>
My current bf is 5'4 and I love him. He's cute, hot, funny, sexy, and incredibly introspective. I've dated a 5'11 guy in the past who wasn't a bad dude, but he was kind of plain.
Don't fuss over so much over your height. Focus on good fashion, good grooming, styles that fits you, picking up hobbies, etc. You guys seriously underestimate how much personality and mannerisms matter. Yes obviously looks matter as well, but it isn't everything on its own.
<comment>
Ok then have fun wasting your life away on this shitty site.

You just contradicted yourself, foid. Women have infinite options on Tinder. You said it yourself; nobody would choose the shorter option.
And come on. People are disgusted by manlets in general. In a society where 80+% of women prefer being submissive, why the fuck would anyone choose someone they physically dominate?

You say that, but...
Granted I've been on the "abandoned" side of things so I also do not want that, but what do you have to say about the people who do seek these kinds of arrangements? Coping? Trauma? Notice I said people.

Go make a tinder with a friend of your's photos and write that you're 5'7. If you can get matches (that lead to a date) everyone will listen
Yes it is something that will stunt your desirability in the grander picture

I feel a little better about my height now, thanks.
I agree with the online dating thing. It looks artificial, and I don't wanna make an account just yet.

Will do, pleasure conversing with you.
<comment>
How does it make you feel knowing that any average man could severely beat yours in a fight? Surely, that can't be much of a turn on.
<comment>
It's a deal without being a big deal. A minor deal, not a major deal.
<comment>
It's not just the norm, it's the rule. I wouldn't even let my sister date someone who's 5'7"
<comment>
Easy to say when you're desperate, a female panderer, and also 5'1" where everyone towers over you.
<comment>
God, I hate women. Do me a favor and get hit by a car this week, sweetie.
<comment>
No woman WANTS to date a short guy. They only do it if they're desperate.
<comment>
Face > height. 
A short man with an attractive face does better than a tall ugly man is what you mean. Guess what? We already know this, only a retard thinks otherwise
<comment>
It's only a problem if you state you're 6'2 and you're actually 5'7.
but if you dont say anything, youll be told "you should have told me early on"
and if youre honest, youll be ghosted
<comment>
Kill yourself, 5'1" is too short, you'll give me shitty short kids, why should I, as a 6'4", man date garbage like you?
<comment>
Lying like that is dumb. If a woman lied about being 120 pounds, meanwhile she's actually 200 pounds, you guys would be pissed. And understandably so.
You can change weight you can't change height. Why do fat whores make this cope up so much?
<comment>
Next time foid include the story about having a crush in first grade on a short boy so therefore women aren't heightists
<comment>
Nath disagrees with you, dumb tard
<comment>
If I looked closely at your relationship I swear I'll find a silver linning . He's either rich. Maybe you're shorter. Lack of choices. Etc. 
There's always a pitch and there's always an outlier. You're no different.
<comment>
Actually you can change height, it just costs $70k.

Hey, that's my school.
Also, not the anon you replied to, but:
getting dates as easily when you're 6'10"
women 5'8" or taller are "not feasible"
Either they didn't have data or they're saying tall chicks are undateable. Both sound questionable.
<comment>
Fuck you nigger. I'm 5'4 and I would kill you with my bare hands. If not. I'll just shoot in the face till your face is unrecognizable. I'll burn your fuckin house down with your family in it. I will make my incel brethren in heaven proud as I rain retribution on your ass with my carefully planned massacre of your entire bloodline. 
I WILL SHOW YOU THE NAPOLEON RAGE!.
<comment>
any average man could severely beat yours in a fight
Lol no. It's based off of weight class/bf%/muscle. A fatass or a twink is not kicking a bulky guys ass. Short or not. It's not happening.
<comment>
Kek. This is peak manlet rage if I've ever seen it. I bet you couldn't even tap my face from way down there.
<comment>
A bulky guy could rip your legs off then bitch slap you, kek. Have you lifted weights before?
<comment>
trying to stack the deck with outliers for your manlet to win
B-b-but the 3 foot m-m-anlet could be 550 lb lean with unobtanium skeletal inserts and an Avatar power-armor suit.
Lmao. C O P E
<comment>
some other guy could...
But not you, manlet.
<comment>
It's not cope, twink. Muscle > height in a fight. Some twink loser isn't going to be kicking anyone's ass. It's just basic common sense Lol
<comment>
Maybe not. But I sure as hell will can throw that Molotov at your smug fuckin face. And it will NOT be the first time a tallfag attempt to fuck with me only to regret it. There will be no honour amongst manlets on that day. Thou shall FUCKIN BURN!.
<comment>
I could though. I'm more muscular than any of you twinks. How much do you weigh and what's your height? I can envision your body with those 2 stats
<comment>
You need to stop being an edgelord
<comment>
Edgelord ?. I'm charged with attmepted murder and breaking and entering. I will fuckin kill you.
<comment>
5'11", 180 lean
No you couldn't, little man. Honestly, it'd be like beating on a woman.
<comment>
I'm not him, retard. I'm short myself. You're just making me cringe
You have a pathetic weight given your height. I'm 190lb and even I am not satisfied with my build, twink. My muscle is more concentrated too. You'd get absolutely bodied like the twink that you are
<comment>
needs to fight a twink for it to even start being fair
I'd say it's sad how far you've fallen, but you're already pretty close to the ground.
<comment>
Kek, nah you're not. I know that because I've already looksmaxxed for my own height.
But even if we pretend, it'd still be pretty sad watching freakin Oddjob try to punch.
<comment>
It's based off of ratios, retard. Obviously height in itself is an advantage, but muscle differences helps even out the scale. Also a say 180lb 6ft guy is going to look skinnier and be weaker than a 5'6" 180lb guy with the same muscle mass and body fat percentage so really the tall guy would have no choice but to eat more for the same power the shorter guy has.
<comment>
Kek, nah you're not. I know that because I've already looksmaxxed for my own height.
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOO this retard thinks he's peak natty with 180lb at 5'11". Let me guess. You're one of those twinks that think you need roids to bulk properly? LOL
<comment>

Cool! I'm glad that you--
shortness is obviously not ideal in a man.
Wait what

When women throw out a whole man over a minor deal, it IS a major deal.

painful, expensive procedure and recovery where you permanently have fragile legs and also the rest of your body is disproportional.
sad

Yeah, but at least a woman will touch your dick.
Aren't you willing to do what it takes?

Women who would do that are worthless women anyway, so the negatives of

are offset by the positives of
tfw no shitty gf

It's bad, but not that bad, though it's still pretty bad

5'11.5" is median male height on dating apps
I don't fucking believe it.
<comment>
Height really isn't as big of a deal as you guys make it out to be.
Source? There are countless studies, from credible institutions, that tell a different story. Not only is there empirical evidence that contradicts you, but there is also a mountain of anecdotal evidence that contradicts you.
Short men, do not watch this. Because this shit is fucking BRUTAL:

<comment>
nobody would call you a coping manlet for saying height doesn't matter, it's usually women or tall guys saying it.
no shit
the idea that you should rope (or transition) is retarded, but only because women are absolute garbage to be around. just get a job and buy hookers like any sane man in 2023.
the fact that people hate online dating is irrelevant when it's only been getting more and more popular.
getting more romantic attention also means more of a chance to find guys who are willing to commit, you just have to accept them and not the handsome dark triad guys.
they absolutely will
<comment>
shitty gf
Wrong. No high quality woman should want a manlet. I wouldn't want my gf to have settled like that in the past.

tfw dgaf about height but women always ignore me saying I'm too short
I don't see the issue, I'd love a taller gf or a shorter gf.
Oh well. I give up. This is why I pretend I'm poor, weeds out the shallow.
<comment>
delete yourself anon
<comment>
Yes I'm sure eating less and going for a walk is on the same level as costly surgery that splits your bones apart and permanently cripples your athletic ability for the rest of your life. Fucking mong.

Literally all of us did this with our tinder profile. No one makes their first tinder profile thinking that they need to lie. Everyone has the default belief that there is someone out there for everyone. People stop believing that when shown evidence to the contrary.
<comment>
Listen incel, nobody said it was fair or easy; they just said there's a solution to your problems. Don't wanna be a manlet incel? Alright, here are your options:
get leg-lengthening surgery
date a Ukrainian
date a Filipina
date anyone from the CIS countries or South America
get rich
I gave you five options. Can only blame yourself after.
<comment>
Can even find a roastie off here or soc if you're willing to put your standards on the floor.
<comment>
You can only blame yourself if you can't put up 200k for leg lengthening bro. Plus the fact that you will have to do physical therapy every single day while having broken legs. 
I don't disagree that leg lengthening is a solution, but the fact is most people simply can't come up with that much money/time off work to recover.
<comment>
It's 70k, and less if you're willing to cut corners.
Anyway, if I were totally desperate, I'd get a ukie. Not gonna lie, anon, they're pretty hot. You'd just have to put up with someone who whores themselves out for a greencard and daily globohomo talk.
<comment>
i didn't read op but everytime i see this tall girl at work i feel like fainting
she's an angel
<comment>
You could say she's like an angel, because she's always looking down on you, anon.
<comment>
TL;DR
its easy bro just be tall stop being short this is why you're an incel
It's all so tiresome.
<comment>
i know, but she's so sweet and feminine despite her height
she's huge, like a head taller than everyone and she never wears heels, the day she does i'm gonna faint for real
<comment>
im 6'3 and no woman has ever been interested in me 
i think women prefer men who are between 5'6 and 6'2
<comment>
I'm a girl, yes an actual biological girl,
You probably look more like a man than the average troon if you have a vagina and still post on r9k of all places.

How do you even pull a taller girl?
Every women that are taller than me just thinks that I am worthless and don't even bother getting to know me.

With rape, height only matters for logistical reasons.

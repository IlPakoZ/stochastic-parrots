how do I forget and forgive, i'm tired of remembering of some mf who wronged me and getting murderous intent, i feel like the only way to get closure is if they died or suffered a worse fate

People who wrong other people always suffer a terrible fate. Just because you cant see it doesn't mean it isn't happening. We all suffer here. No one is happy. We arent put here to be happy.
You forgive because holding onto hate put stress onto your body, and because you know genuinely that there is an all knowing god that sorts us all out. You dont have to lift a finger or utter a curse. God delivers, and quickly. Just enjoy your life.

yeah dude im sure, she found some other dude 2 weeks after she broke up with me and my only 2 friends ive known since highschool ditched me to do stuff with a literal who, like we were playing ranked flex and they kicked me out cause there cant be 4 people in queue (i'm just giving an example they did shit like this on multiple occasions) and yesterday the girl I was finally starting to like is together with a firefighter and prolly gets railed by him everyday, it just gets worse and worse and i'll spend my 22nd birthday alone again,
I'm honestly wondering if i'd disappear one day will someone notice?

In my experience forgiveness can only follow understanding. Not sure if it works differently for others.
For example, if someone starts dating again right after a break-up chances are low they did so with evil intent. People who are unstable in relations often grew up in a less stable household. This might help explain the behavior. 
Also people often postpone breaking-up because they're afraid of hurting their partner, so chances are they were already adaptating to a life without partner and checking out mentally before the break-up allowing them to move on quicker than the partner being left behind. 
Understanding these concepts allows you to forgive, not because you feel less bad over the break-up, but because you feel less deliberatly wronged.
So I guess try to understand different perspectives.

They dont have agency, it's not even worth thinking about. Sorry that shit happened to you but women are stupid and easily swayed.

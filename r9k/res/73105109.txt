balding manlet dicklet wizard
don't care that much anymore
just slurping on neetbux, playing vydia and watching animu
have to go therapy from time to time to keep the bux
therapist says i can still find a gf, go to university and get a job
Lmao, how can normalfags lie like that? It was over before it even began. Hope is poison.

how old are you and how did you end up like this?

I mean theoretically you can, it will just be someone no sane person would ever want and even then it'll be a hassle.

Early 30's. Got diagnosed with schizo when I was a teen. It all went downhill from there.
Exactly. It's like gearing up and training to reach level 40, tops, while most people are 60+ and the desirable ones are 80+.

Honestly man if you can, find a better therapist.
Mine was always honest with me even if it would piss me off. That's how I was able to trust him at least. I knew eventually that everything he said was genuine and there was no hopium involved even if I personally didn't believe in what he was saying about me myself.

Fucking proud of you, NEETbro. I'm a wageslave, but given that they take whatever they want in taxes, it makes me feel better to know real niggas like you are out there putting those bennies to work and BTFO normiefaggots. I'd rather all my taxes go to NEETbros than war or single mothers.

The thing is that I have to go to this therapist, it's tied to the NEETBux. He says that I'm being a defeatist and just don't want to change. Liar, because I tried many times, but I'm just not cut for the normie world.
Thank you my fren. I did try to become a wagie before, but they would rather hire women, colors and queers.

I feel that, white manlet bro. Also a wizard, stay strong. Not balding yet, but hey, God hasn't finished ruining me yet. 
Fuck wagies and their slave attitude, if the disabil-i-bux button still exists when I ruin my body through drugs and goyslop and cigarettes, I'm hitting it hard, and the zoomers that wanna look cool can fund my life doing menial nonsense in a cubicle like I did, as their girlfriends literally wipe my ass as a CNA at the hospital. Until then, I'll continue to be a shit employee that wastes every moment I can.

Exactly. Just do the bare minimum to get by. No need to waste energy with normalfags. They are not worthy.

Got that right bro, stay strong, fuck these normalshits.

Why would you WANT to change your life? Holy shit I WISH I was a NEET so much I'd kill to have that lifestyle. I hate wageslaving, if I could just kill all my time playing vidya I'd love that. Be fucking grateful.

same, except I have to work. No neetbux or therapist bullshit, just a stupid ass job that I wouldn't mind except half the time I can't get enough hours. Might be homeless before long. when I go a few days without masturbating I start to get really frustrated. 34 years old, no sex, no girlfriend, not even a kiss.
I used to browse /r9k/ over a decade ago. I used to be miserable but at least I had time. Now I don't even have that. and I can't bring myself to rope. I just wish I could snap and quit caring about anything but I can't.

Sorry for taking so long to reply, I was away. The normies are pure scum, and I suffered the most when I tried to be one of them. Keep it cozy my brother.
Thanks fren, I hope you can reach that one day. Sometimes I wonder what human contact, like hugging or kissing a girl, feels like, but other than that, I don't really wanna do what the kike therapist says.

I hope not, I wish well. Do you have family around? I do feel lonely sometimes too, but there's nothing one can do about it.

Same, but this place changed a lot.

I tried doing pic related. It can work sometimes, but not always.

If I were a god, I would never be bored.
I remember the epic things I did in my previous life as a dark sorcerer and how amazing I was
All other humans vanish and I get to figure out how to live with everything still available. First day is just realizing that it's not just quite, but everyone's actually gone. Power's still on though so fresh food on the shelves hasn't begun to spoil and I have a feast. Eventually leads to me finding some random house to live in somewhere I haven't been. I loot a library and learn how to properly grow vegetables. Loot all the canned foods I can. Loot a camping store for those camping solar panels, battery banks, crank lights. Loot houses until I can find a unlocked laptop, some phone/ipod/music playing device. Loot the music stores if they even sell physical media and not just merch. Then just spend any spare time going through random houses or just exploring dark stores because the powers obviously gone out a long time ago.
Then I get paranoid because why the fuck am I left and commit suicide because what the fuck did this and why am I left
BASED, its all that trully matters , that and being cute
I got an eerie feeling reading that. scary stuff my guy. I'd be afraid of someone always stepping out from around a corner in the stores and coming to hurt me.
having every woman in the world wanting to fuck me except for nuclear family
when walking last women at night, scaring them by lunging forwards at them and taunting them lol
sneaking into my sexy neighbors apartment
thinking of ways to steal internet and power in my apartment
I would never commit any real crimes tho desu. I hate theifs and abusers.

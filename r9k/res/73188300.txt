Intelligence only really matters so you don't fuck up with what you obtained through already having an upper hand. Rarely in life can you through raw intellect alone change a situation it takes having good stuff around first.
Intelligence is an over rated trait to have and not really beneficial at all. Most scientific progress happened because of a discovery of some new material not brain power.
Women literally have no reason to go after nerds who aren't already successful.

I am always amazed at how many permaNEETs have 130+ IQs...

Women are attracted to intelligence insofar as they can conceive of it, which is often quite diminished

Yup. Intelligence doesnt mean shit also if the people you are with dont even see you as that despite your own self knowing that definitely. Its being at the right place at the right time that is honestly the kicker to any success in this world. I can have 160 IQ and know how to formulate my own equations and even bots to figure my shit out for me, but since I have no friends, no family and basically am an isolated nobody, your best right place at the right time moment would be a person or company recognizing your talent but if your extensive history is laden with being a big nobody, you can probably expect your work and your behavior to be under more scrunity and doubt by just about almost everyone.

I think attacking Russia was the big mistake. If the Fuhrer had kept his pact with Stalin, europe would have been his empire.

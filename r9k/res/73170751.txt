So how do people in the industry actually find influencers to shill their products? Do they just search for people lets say on youtube manually the same as anyone else, does some third party manage exchanges between them or is there actually some sort of proprietary backend for businesses that lets them view the largest channels for certain demographics? How does this shit all work?

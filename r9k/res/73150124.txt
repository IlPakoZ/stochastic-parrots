I saw this individual the other day. I swear that I noticed the Uebercharge afterwards which made me laugh a bit.

play TF2 for the first time in like 8 months
queue for Harvest
literally the first thing I hear is a guy micspamming Johnny Rebel
later, join a trade server
literally the first thing I hear is "Alright. It wasn't a racist assertion, it's common sense"
This is the last game where this shit is allowed.
Every Garry's Mod had an incident where they banned community servers for "moral degeneracy".

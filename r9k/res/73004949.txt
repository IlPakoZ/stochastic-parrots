I never follow through things to completion. Even in things I enjoy like games. I have 170 hours on my character on Elden Ring which I have been playing since release and I am still on the snow mountain tops area or whatever its called. I just sort of fuck around a lot and get nowhere or take 15x longer than everyone else to do the same shit and I do the same thing in life. It's like I have no drive to do stuff. Its like I get into it, then it all grinds to a halt, like I have cement strapped to me and it's so difficult to get any momentum going and then I just say, fuck this and the cycle repeats a few days, weeks or months later. I don't think I get the same chemical rewards as everyone else either desu
I am at the end of the fire Giant and I just sit at the top of the fire Pitt part, without burning the tree. I don't want to kill my maiden

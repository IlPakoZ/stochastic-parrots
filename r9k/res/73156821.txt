Here's a thought experiment. What if in a future society there were strict eugenic requirements for males? So basically there would only be Chads. All males would be at least 6'2, strong facial features, big dick, typical chad looks. Would roasties still look for the top 2% within this population of Chads? Or would this solve the incel crisis?

If looks are the only thing changing, a speculation is that women might shift to the lowest or more foreign looking denominator.

Is that because of money? Or because they are less common than other types of males?

Due to "chad" becoming the new status quo, women would only go after the top 2% of those Chads. It wouldn't matter how many times you repeated this process, women will always chase the minority of men.

Less common.

The idea the same women going for the 2% now would do the same with a raised bar, and everyone who doesn't see a chance would go for niches/exotics.

strict eugenic requirements for males
this would reduce the supply of males, making males more scarce. I believe would lead to a society were one male would have a harem of women. In some way this is the future we're heading to, women would rather be Chads side hoe than some genetic have-nots wife.

Why does a factory worker or a garbage man need chiseled abs and an 8 inch cock?

"You can always be thinner, look better."
There will always be someone who is more "Chad" than you. Unless they genetically change men to look all the same this will always apply.

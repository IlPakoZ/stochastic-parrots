why is Jack Denmo (self improvement guru) hanging out at university parties when hes not in university and hes 26 years old(at the time of the photo)
is it normal for older guys that arent in university to attend university parties? is this something that I should do?
No, its cringe. Unless he only goes to parties of his former fraternity, or works for said frat and visits other ones for whatever reason.
Once he is past 30, it starts getting really cringe.
going to a uni party at 26 is fine, half the people there will be 26 anyways
he didnt go to the university. he even got charged with sexual assault at one point

Auervaara often played a sort of inexperienced, timid boy to the women and told them he was shy and afraid of women. This way Auervaara appealed to the women's sense of affection and pretended to throw himself at their mercy.
He tricked 20+ women into marrying him by using this method.

Didn't work for me. Had a cute girl cold approach me at starbucks and she never wanted to see me again after our first date of coffee and sex. She noticed my timidfaggotry and asked if I had a mental illness. I didn't appeal to any motherly instinct, I just got rejected.

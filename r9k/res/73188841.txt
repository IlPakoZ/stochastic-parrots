I just went out to have a drink with a QT-pi colleague. I am not sure whether i did good but things are definitely looking up. She laughs at my jokes. How do i not cuck myself? I need to play it cool right? I am still in 'the le funny mysterious guy' stage. I felt like i spilled some spaghetti but if i play my cards right who knows..maybe my real life can finally begin.

Btw she asked me out. And I fucked up. She paid for the first drinks.

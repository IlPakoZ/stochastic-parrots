You are aware you can be cripplingly depressed BECAUSE you're an autist, right?
the cringiness left my body by that age and was replaced by an overwhelming desire to be left alone while putting on the bare minimum of social niceties to be able to have a job
It's really that simple. I have diagnosed autism and that's basically what happened to me. If you have autism, you're going down a path of self-destruction by doing this.
what am i suppose dto do then? kill myself?

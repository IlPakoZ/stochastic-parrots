parents thought I was autistic from the ages of 5 - 13
stop being autistic by the time I enter high school
develop crippling depression instead

You are aware you can be cripplingly depressed BECAUSE you're an autist, right?

the cringiness left my body by that age and was replaced by an overwhelming desire to be left alone while putting on the bare minimum of social niceties to be able to have a job

Be autistic
Force yourself to act against your nature, which is exhausting and dehumanising
Become depressed
It's really that simple. I have diagnosed autism and that's basically what happened to me. If you have autism, you're going down a path of self-destruction by doing this.

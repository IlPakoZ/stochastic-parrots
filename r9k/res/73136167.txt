You guys always complain about being lonely and being virgin, but why not just lower standards a little bit? There are tons of average looking and slightly below average girls, why do you guys only want the stacies?
I used to be a robot too until I turned 19, then I started dating an average looking girl and we were in a relationship for over a year. I've been in a couple relationships now and can say that even an average girl can be beautiful if you like her enough.
Women destroy your life one small step at a time. I'm good bro.
How did you first meet her, anon?
I'm not in the top 20% of looks
I'm above average women's league looks wise I'm just an incel cuz im socially retarded. If I started dating an average woman shed eventually leave me now that she has the confidence of being able to date a handsome guy like me, shell go after the guy who is equally handsome but also is johnny cool socialite type.
i had the cutest girl i know as my gf but she left me after finding out about my lolicon past
There aren't any average looking girls who are single. There are boss bitch bimbos who are single because of how mentally ill and toxic they are and there are hippo looking fuckers that can't stop stuffing their mouth because of how mentally ill they are. Those are your choices as a man. If you aren't attractive you will never get any attention from the first group.
Rip, shoulda hid it better

why do men received zero emotional support?
im autistic male zoomer, basically never had a friend reach out to me over the past 5 years to do anything, nobody cares about me, people treat me so badly, meanwhile autistic girls get constant emotional support from their friends
guess nobody gives a shit about men

Literally the opposite. Sexy volume, awful cottage cheese shape. Bitch clearly doesn't work out. If she trained her legs and glutes I'd bury my face in it for days

cottage cheese is texture which i agree is awful, but its because of the size, not overall shape which is great

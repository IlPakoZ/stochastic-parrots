I wish you could be thin while also eating taco bell and drinking a lot regularly
I force myself not to drink alcohol simply because the weight gain aggravates me so much.
In the past year I've limited my alcohol to only getting drunk like once per 2 weeks on average, but I haven't had a drink in over 5 weeks now
have you considered abusing stimulants
i wish i didn't have a chocolate addiction and didn't feel the need to buy a candy bar every time i'm in the store
Obesity should be the least of your concerns when eating that poison
just eat/drink it 2/7 days a week maximun and start hiking
my mommy keeps chocolate chips in the cupboard for baking so I just grab a handful of them if I'm feeling like needing chocolate
I gave up on all of that and just took the fat pill. Just eat whatever I want now.
I wish you could be thin
I can't be everything for you
You could burn anywhere from 3k to 6k calories per day and up depending on your build and workout routine. Unless you are going crazy on the food and abusing sweet drinks and butter it's not difficult to maintain weight.
Just workout 6-12 hours a week
3k to 6k
Nonsense. I burn like 1400 on a 25 mile bike ride
yeah 3k to 6k is like 10 hours of swimming lmao
Diet Baja? It's not that much worse.
same but with mcdonalds anon. fastfood is so good but I want to be thin

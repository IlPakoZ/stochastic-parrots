Goofy larp. Everyone wants marriage.
If you're not married and single you keep your options open. Every woman does this. Goodbye lahpah fagett
<comment>
Yes she is right and you aren't getting Nirvana from getting a gf but it is still an improvement over rotting alone. Why do women and normies keep getting in relationships if they are so useless and even burdensome?
<comment>
A relationship isn't going to make you happy
I'm a failed normie and this is the most bullshit advice full on normalfags give holy hell it pisses me off everytime. The only way I can see someone legitimately believing this is if they're a stupid whore and have never been outside a relationship for more than a few weeks
<comment>
Why do women and normies keep getting in relationships if they are so useless and even burdensome?
Because normies are mentally healthy and don't need anything to be "fixed" in their lives generally. That's why. For them relationships are just good fun most of the time.
<comment>
Or because they've been burned by everyone who ever "loved" them.
When you love someone it doesn't mean you have to fuck them. You can love someone for who they are and it isn't romantic.
That's the kind of love people really seek.
Genuinity.
<comment>

Every needs some good fun once in a while. Don't you think? I don't think everywhere thinks getting a gf would make them content but it would probably be fun not being alone and having some validation. I guess that's how normalfags think too? Why do you think we are so different? It's just gaslighting to make undesirables shut up.
<comment>
*everyone here thinks
<comment>
It's infuriating. 90 IQ platitude. Yes, of course it's not one to one. You can have gf and be unhappy. Same as how you can be rich and unhappy. 
Fact remains that I would be a lot happy if I didn't have to ever worry about paying off debts or making rent. Fact remains that regular physical affection, emotional validation and support and a partner to handle the challenges of life with would certainly *help* the odds of being happy.
<comment>
Every needs some good fun once in a while. Don't you think?
Entierly but most robots don't even have genuine male friends irl. Do you think any normie that sees you as a friendless internet user will think you're very fun to live and sleep with every days?
Most robots don't know what should be their priority in life.

I'm an I'm an archaeologist, I specialize in Roman history &amp; small finds expert. 8,000 years ago was the Neolithic period for most of Europe. I'm assuming they're talking about that. Man was just settling in one area, building houses &amp; establishing communities. One of my friends is an anthropologist. This is very interesting I never thought about it to be honest. I'm going to send her the screenshot that a non-posted about 17 women reproduced for every one man.
<comment>
Unironically yes. Sick of normalfags putting relationships on a pedestal. Stop relying on some whore to make you happy.
<comment>
Sounds like a better deal than struggling alone and getting laid is a bonus too. At least it would give some self worth to many. 
I know you are just trolling and fucking with us but the girl in the Pic you posted was most probably serious because people would do anything to not acknowledge problems.

Practice what you peach. I am sure you aren't even a Virgin or atleast not someone completely isolated from women for a decade.

ACTUALLY. it is that big of a deal. much bigger of a deal for males, btw
<comment>

I'm not. Stop focusing on relationships so much. There are hundreds of milestones that robots fall to pass before they should even start seeking for a healthy relationship. Get some irl friends and do anything but being a consummer behind a screen.

<comment>
I still don't understand how being alone is better than having somone stick around even being intimate with you. That alone is a major self esteem boost. I don't believe in your milestone theory either. Getting a relationship isn't a step you reach after certain requirements are met. Even junkies and mentally ill women keep seeking relationships despite having plethora of mental problems because it's a basic human desire. I know friendless loners with Gfs just because they are good looking. They are content.

For a normies it's not. A mutual relationship between normies is always better for them than being alone.
You want a relationship because you think it'll fix you. It won't be any fun for your partner to have to play a mommy therapist for a manchild and you'll be dissapointed and heartbroken once she'll obviously give up on that role.
Wanting to share a mutual relationship is a healthy desire. Seeking to be fixed thought one isn't.
<comment>
Well OK man. Everyone feels invincible like this once in a while when he thinks he needs noone in his life. Keep riding the high as if you wouldn't jump in the lap of the first women that throws you a bone.

Making too many assumptions here. Not everyone wants a mother figure. Some people just dont want to be not alone. I dont why do you think everyone here is as broken and mentally ill as you want to be. Definitely more sane than e girls and drug addicts that keep having "abusive" relationships.
<comment>
I dont why do you think everyone here is as broken and mentally ill as you want to be.
If you were just half of a normie you would have asked or even dmed online your friends to ask them about how their past relationships felt like rather than making a thread on /r9k/.

Normies mutually value each others in a relationship. If you think most robots are capable to genuinely listen and care for their partner for more than 3 minutes without expecting to be rewarded with sex, lurk more.

Failed normies seek to be fixed thought relationships that are unbalanced from the start. The only difference between you and them is you're not part of the gender that picks the bride anymore. Is this what you want to be, the male equivalent of a single mother that need a strong husband to support her and make her feel still young?

I should be saying that. This isn't even an incel forum anymore.

They don't. For any gain they get on the short term they loose two times it on the long term. Unless the other person is as much fucked up in your head or you're not willing to seriously make up for it it will never work on the long term.

And they still keep crawling back to that pit. I don't think they would say that they would have preferred being alone over the negatives in the long run.I wonder why. You still haven't given a good argument why someone absolutely lonely wouldn't benefit with somone putting up with him and providing him with some humanisation.
<comment>
Now you are playing with semantics
There was a time when "incel" was a trait most anons shared but didn't defined their entiere beings.
And they still keep crawling back to that pit.
Did I ever said they were smart people? Just like you, they just can't imagine a world where they are not with someone, even if that were to hurt them each time when they chase for it. Every time they try and think "this time, i'm sure it'll work, it never did up to now, but I know you just can't die alone, right?"
You still haven't given a good argument why someone absolutely lonely wouldn't benefit with somone putting up with him and providing him with some humanisation.
Someone absolutely lonely is very likely to gain enormously from a long friendship with someone that values them for what they are and encourage them to genuinely improve for themselves. They are not likely to gain much by staying with a partner that'll quickly grow exhausted of them and will have to painfully end the relationship before even a year has passed. But sure, you might get sex.

Its not about intelligence but key human desire to feel loved and accepted.

Still better than an year spent doing nothing and rotting alone. At least you will feel worthy for and like a normal human for a while. It might even be stepping stone towards general betterment. Also sex is not a trivial thing If you don't get it regulary.

Every cell in my homo sapien body tells me every day that I want to cum balls deep in the female of the species.
<comment>
But how does she know?
If she experienced romantic love then she is like a rich person who says money doesn't matter.
If she didn't experience romantic love (extremely unlikely) then she can't make a comparison as she has a narrow view on the subject. For example I always slept alone for 30 years and I never felt like I'm missing anything. Then I slept with someone I trust (NOT SEX) and it felt like pure bliss. It was something I didn't knew it existed before.
According to the whole human society love and relationships are the major driving forces behind most peoples actions. Only drugs can compete. People who live alone and never feel love are proven to become depressed, sad and die early. It is more likely than she is wrong.
<comment>

You can get that thought friendship and participating in the community. In fact it's much more easier to get that thought friendships and the community than thought a relationship alone. And having a healthy friends group and being visible for the people around you will only make it easier for you to find someone.

OK never said anything otherwise. But in the end you're just likely to be back at the start after a heartbreaking separation, with just your virginity in less. If you're rotting alone right now and are looking for a relationship, you're just trying to skip necessary steps in socialisation to get immediatly to the peak.

Why do you keep stating the obvious. You act is if everyone here detests friends despite opposite being the obvious. You can crave friendship and a Gf at the same time.

I don't believe in your hierarchy theory. Relationships needn't necessary come after having an active social life. It's just that relationship are a major improvement in the lives of loners and incels even if we assume they would not be able to sustain it like most normies don't. Bottom text is that the girl is gaslighting people to feel OK with not experiencing something fundamental to human psyche as if its more harmful than good which obviously wrong.

Everytime /r9k/ is asked how their platonic life is going everyone reply they're friendless or only hang with 1-3 dudes they distrust.

Never said a relationship would necessary come to you if you do attain all those steps first, I'm saying it's very not likely that any relationship would end working if you don't.

Survivorship bias. If there's one step in life where robots are trully tempted to grow balls to an hero, it's after they broke up with their gf after a 3-6 months relationship.

It doesn't have to "work". Even being a part of someone's else life like that is a huge psychological gain.

I don't know where you are getting this data from. Maybe someone fucked over by mentally ill women but the people here who got even a whiff of pussy sound very happy about it because as I said it validates them proves to them that they have it in them to be loved.
<comment>
Romantic and sexual fulfillment is necessary to be happy in 99% of people. The exceptions are maybe celibate monks with extreme religious conviction, or the few people who have vocations and passions in life that give them a purpose. Most people don't have convictions or purpose anymore. Most people work some boring job and go home to watch netflix, maybe go for drinks on the weekends. That sort of life is only bearable if you have someone to share it with, or better yet have a family to care for and look after so you aren't so focused on your own failings. Of course it goes without saying that it is mostly women spouting this nonsense, who have easy access to relationships.
slaving away studying and working so you can cope with travelling and hobbies to experience 0.001% of the happiness chad has from simply existing
LMAO

I don't know what's more likely, that this guy got a stupid degree, doesn't really give a shit about his hobbies and is lying about his other things or women really are so shallow that they won't let a short minority date then even if he has a good life.
<comment>
you think it'll fix you. It won't be any fun for your partner to have to play a mommy therapist for a manchild
Holy projection
Because we all know that normies don't break up and treat others like shit. Wanting a relationship is natural. You are literally mad that someons refuses to yield.
A mutual relationship between normies is always better for them than being alone.
Not really otherwise they wouldn't arguee that relationships are overrated, the are the ones that come up with this because they are the ones that got burned by it.
Holy shit you are the one saying that relationships are overrated but at the same you sell them as something that you only have the right to get if you reach a Zen like state.
Faggots like you are just bitter about how they never got a relationship and need to cope by pretending that men that look for one are broken, had ulterior motives or are delusional. In your mind the only people that fail are the ones that don't "deserve something that is overrated".

Tell the truth why are you shitting so much in the notion of a man that fails to get a girlfriend wanting to get a girlfriend?
<comment>
You know what is the worst part of this asshole saying "get frienship not girls. You will be better"? That I know actual chads that fuck a lot of women and got in a serious relationship once or twice.
They don't preach any of this, what they preach is:
-looks matter and a loot but girls have different tastes, go hard for one type of girl or settle in being presentable
-Lie until the end about the fact that you have a girlfirend(lol)
-First impressions are the best impression
-If you didn't charm her in 3 weeks, she will lose interest fast, in this period of time is where you were supposed to fuck her
-Girls like to have orbiters, don't become that, they don't even mind if the other orbiters are girls
-the more girls you have wanting you, the more she will want you for herself
-Girls will preach about relationships being more important that getting a girlfriend or boyfriend because they get hit on all the time, they just take it for granted, a girl that wants and persues one is because she is not getting hit on and needs her fix of attention
There are more but the most important thing is that they neve tell me to try to get friends first and second..... and last.
If you want friendship go and look for it if you want a girlfirend go and look for it. Those are 2 different needs and they make that really clear. Getting one won't solve the other need

A few years ago a woman on the internet implicated that she maybe liked my company. This was enough to elevate my mood to a point where I could do things besides lie in bed all day, which led to me writing and publishing an academic article and subsequently getting admitted to a top ranking graduate program.
If a girl I never even met could do that, where would I be if I had a gf?
<comment>
tee hee you're not entitled to love and relationships
And you aren't entitled to protection from rape either
<comment>
Yeah, it's normal. Normies do what they do because even the slightest amount of female attention is enough to boost your drive tenfold. Take a normie, deprive him of female romantic attention, and he'll be living the lie down and rot lifestyle after a week. Take a rotting depressed incel NEET, give him female romantic attention, and he'll be fixed after a week.

<comment>
normies are mentally healthy
when depression is at an all time high
when suicides are at an all time high
when anti-depressants and medication that fuck up your head are being taken at an all time high
People in relationships are generally happier than singles, and sex reduces depression and anxiety. Normies may get into relationships because they have the social aptitude to find one without much effort but without that they are just as vulnerable to loneliness as robots and incels.
<comment>
a relationship isn't going to fix you and you're probably going to end up hurting your partner if you don't fix your own issues and expect them to
Correct and good advice.
if you want a partner then you are brainwashed
Incorrect, and actually the other way around. It's literally biologically programmed into every human (and every other animal) to want a mate. If you don't want a partner, you are a broken human.
<comment>
Umm actually you can be perfectly happy spending all your life in a blank windowless room with no entertainment and 0 human interaction being fed flavorless gruel once a day. 
You have all your body needs to continue existing. Everything else would be an extra. If you can't find happiness in this predicament, you wouldn't be happy if you basic psychological needs were fulfilled either.
Me? Why no, of course I don't live like that.

100% right. You people have bought into an ideal lifestyle that is less and less attainable. Love is not for everyone.
<comment>
Maybe rodents don't have the emotional wherewithal to understand that living alone isn't intrinsically bad? Stop acting like a fucking puppy.
<comment>
Isnt the fact that she is writing such a defense in the first place proof she is wrong?
Like if I wrote a cope post about how gold is just a metal. It is not valuble to our survival. It should not be expensive just because society has deemed it so for thousands of years.
While technically right, I am wrong. Gold is valuble. Gold is coveted. It is just a metal, but many cannot afford it no matter how much they want it.
That is essentially OPs pic. Arguing that romance is not valuble when in reality IT IS and simply making the argument further proves it. I would have more respect if they conceded the point that relationships are important, just not to them.
There is an old 50s song with these lyrics:
You never go to nightclubs and you just dont care to dance
You dont have time for silly things like moonlight and romance
You only care for dollar bills tied neatly in a stack
But when you kiss a dollar bill it doesnt kiss you back
<comment>

I recently moved out and got my own place, and holy shit I've never felt more alone. Its shit.
Everyday I come home from work to an empty house, sit alone and waste away hours looking forward to going to bed.
I'm just barely scraping by too, so its not like I have the money to enjoy myself every now and again. All my friends have moved on with their infinitely more successful lives and I have fuck all chances of making new ones.
What the fuck am I even working for?
I have zero social skills and constantly talk to myself like a fucking schizo, no woman would ever want to be with me and to be honest I wouldn't blame them. 
Just working myself to an early grave via alcoholism most likely, ain't life grand.

Damn these atomized bug people never stop coping. Sad.
Don't bother they're hopeless. Stop visiting this board it's soul rotting.

It's the disconnect between people's actual feelings and what the OP of the post thinks people "should" feel. For example, even if you were technically right about gold not having any intrinsic value, you will never convince 99% of the people to stop valuing gold. Moralizing about how people "should" feel about things is pointless and does nothing for anybody.

Every variation of normie advice is "just stop caring" which is funny because it actually takes far less responsibility upon yourself than to act and care proactively
It is in my nature to "just stop caring" and it is my humanity and my consciousness which drives me to care. It cannot be enlightened to stop caring and go with the flow, because it is so easy and natural

wtf if you were actually a narcissist you'd be constantly craving validation and attention from other people and blowing up when you didn't get it

an ideal lifestyle that is less and less attainable
And why should I be okay with that? These are basic life experiences that were normal for everyone way back then and are becoming more restricted by the day. Why the ever loving fuck should I watch their extinction and not be mad at it? This even isn't romanticizing the past, you'd have to be braindead to not look at the world around you and see that things are getting worse. You might be okay with your cubicle. Own nothing, be happy. I'm not okay with that.

Wouldn't so little diversity between biological fathers massively increase the chance of inbreeding and defects?

There's a reason christians pair the "turn the other cheek" nonsense with a promise of eternal bliss. It's beyond absurd to ask people to make such a selfless sacrifice for a society that despises them with no reward or benefits.

i'm going to die alone, so what. i've been ostracized and pushed out of this society for most of my life. now, that i have became desirable and asked for by it, i refuse to join it.
imagine being bullied for so long and then the same bullies would like to become your friends. i have only two words for those people. fuck. you.

I'm none of those anons but yeah, it doesn't even have to be a shallow friendship. I have friends that I'm sure would take a bullet for me and I'd do the same. We can talk about literally anything, there are no barriers. Yet I still feel lonely from time to time. Friends are not a replacement for romance. When I see my friends with their own stable relationships of course I'm gonna feel a bit weird, you'd have to be a fucking brick not to.

why are people laughing at him again
realize you will never get laid
decide that this shit aint worth it and focus on your shit
lol, what a loser. amirite?
<comment>
because it comes off as a desperate cope
s-sure i'm sad and lonely all the t-time but that doesn't matter b-because i have all these great hobbies i c-can do on my own!
he didn't actually decide it wasn't worth it he just settled for distracting himself and bottling up all his feelings
i'm not even laughing at him, i respect him for IMPROOOVING instead of giving up and remaining a skillless NEET like most of us, but it goes to show that it's practically impossible to feel truly happy and fulfilled without romantic connection

objectively, he seems to be doing good, better than most people here. he's one nothing wrong really, he still sounds like a loser to most people however, and that's what matters in the real world.

Is there a way without straight up asking them?
It's honestly a dealbreaker to me. I don't want to invest in a girl only to find out she has a roastie.

This is like asking if you can tell if a guy is circumcised without looking at their dick

All girls have roasties without surgery. You should not risk it, anon. Don't date any of them.

I know this isn't true. I have heard many guys say their wives or gfs have innies.

You could always ask a guy about that.

I was going to say it was impossible, but >>72994438 reminded me we live in the current year and everyone has a camera in their hand 24/7 and is very willing to use it.
So, yeah, try to do a bit of a sexting thing and ask for a couple of photos when appropriate.

How much of your behavior is automatic?
For example I visited 4chan without really thinking about it
I sometimes find myself automatically going to /b/ instead of /r9k/, even though I stopped using that board in 2009
You are now breathing manually
You've now realized there's no comfortable spot in your mouth for your tongue

You haven't blinked in a few seconds. Go ahead and blink
You realize you can see a little bit of your nose all the time

Ah, the perfect combo of words to make everyone self-aware of their bodily functions.

The robot is the only thing preventing this board from being a place for imagedumping porn
knot reallie
The robot in addition to moderation I guess

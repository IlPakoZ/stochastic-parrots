You like tiktok they/thems

yours seems like a kind non-bratty stacy, sometimes she doesn't like the much attention she gets
Made mine look like my IRL crush. Curious to see what people think she's liked based off this.
Based her off a girl i saw in a dream once
Posting this qt again, since I like how she came out.
Very snarky (but caring) office senior.
Will dump you once she gets her citizenship.
Very fluffy and cutesy. Likes expensive girly things and sweets.
Tries her hardest to look stern and dominating but fails miserably every time, which makes her look like a dork. Good goth-ish/e-girl aesthetic though.

She has an OnlyFans, eats hot chips, and lies. 
Animal lover, probably has some geeky interests. I'd imagine she is into Star Wars. 
The goth gf that everyone wants but doesn't have.
A different variation of the goth gf. Loves poetry and is always reflecting on life. Incredibly shy, but kind.
A ginger with a soul

Cute!!! She simply seems like a comfy cuddlebug that would be so nice to be with
Brown sporty tomboy! You can probably beat her in a fight... but you know and she knows that will never happen

She looks exotic.. made for human men (or women)
I love your style! Casual with a side of refinement, it's so pretty. Looks to me you / she would be the type to enjoy the simple things about life, and isn't about drama

She loves plants, also kids love her. I can picture her volunteer at a kindergarten and reading them a book in a very nice voice. She is also actually sociable, but in a wallflower way

lowkey cosplay gf with a bit of an intimidating aura alone, but sticks really close to you when you're together
quirky and bubbly gf who fawns over any pet she sees - she loves iced tea so much that she makes her own pitchers of them, experimenting with different fruits

sporty gf who plays tennis, badminton, or runs track - always hanging out with her friend group so you find her in pictures a bunch, but never selfies

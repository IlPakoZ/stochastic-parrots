Because mostly everything online is corporatised as fuck. Most interesting things have died off and what is left is their husk is some lame reddit/discord communities.

Fuck Reddit and discord . I miss forum days where you had a close nit community

Social media is trash. It's as bland as a supermarket magazine. You have to dig deep or be part of an inner-circle of content creators to enjoy the more interesting parts of the internet now.
Used to be just knowing the URL to this website meant you were "in the know" of internet culture. Those were fun times.

Fuck social media since it decentralized internet and most of Trafic goes to a few big websites

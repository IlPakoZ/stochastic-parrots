I drank too much coffee now my anxiety is going crazy. I hate being autistic
How much coffee is too much?
For me, 2 cups
Have you tried having 2 cups of coffee with butter and make them bulletproof and setting a timer so you can have them separated 4 hours apart?
No I just chug them so I can get a little buzz since I don't drink any more. I usually do 1 cup and I'm ok but for some reason 2 gets me super anxious
Yeah, when i'm at work we have a free coffee machine and I drink around 5 in the morning, it's too much but because they are small I drink a lot
I should reduce to your level so i'm not bouncing of the walls

Shit is starting to get real for me. I keep feeling depressed uncontrollably. I didn't know being a 22 khv with only one friend is getting to me this bad. Life pass me by so fast and I didn't do much with it, I don't even have a purpose or meaning in my life. I don't even know what to do with my life. I know how it feels now and i've been so blind to the truth that i'm an actual loser. Anyone know this feel?
bro, I'm a virgin and I'm 26. you gotta lighten up, and roll with it. your virginity ain't going anywhere so why don't you relax? play some video games and smoke drugs.
be happy you realized and feel like something is wrong, i ignored life entire I was 30
bro shit ur pants eat cum just relax bro fart and shart and suck cock bro lighten up and chillax my man shart and eat shit and smoke cock
22 khv with only one friend
Try 30 khv and no friends.
Try to be 35 khv desperately trying to cope using AI. You still have plenty of time to turn your life around.
I can relate very much. I knew I was wasting time in my teens but now I wake up and can't believe how much time really passed, now the "best" part of my life is over before it started.
What is wasting life? If you base yourself of others then you will always be miserable, anons have ascended and was even more blackpilled than before.
anons have ascended
into what?

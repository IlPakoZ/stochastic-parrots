i'm pretty sure i have sleep apnea or something i keep waking up out of breath and it's really annoying
i'm not fat or anything either
some of us just plain have shit to do
Illegal drug hallucinations are way better than dreams, dude. All of my dreams are just slightly wrong versions of reality with an overwhelming sense of impending doom.
12+ hours of sleep, anime/movie/tv show/streamer-drama, porn, shitpost, game, sleep
been doing that everyday for last 8 years
It takes me forever to fall asleep and I usually wake up early once or twice, and then before I know it it's morning and I feel worse than when I went to bed like the last night of sleep never happened.
Not all of us can neetbuxmaxx, I barely got time to jerk off or take a shit

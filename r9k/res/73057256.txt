What the title says. If you were to meet a man/woman who was just like you (looks, personally, interests, ect.), would you want to date them?
I'll be honest, I think I would, but not because I think I'm great. I'd be able to share my interests, and someone just like me would be open to cuddling. Outside of that, though, I imagine I wouldn't enjoy my own company all too much
and while I'm not one to be too particular about looks, she would probably be the antithesis of my preferences

absolutely fucking no lol

A female clone of me would be a tall attractive blonde with a great personality. Yes, I would date her.

i think too much of the same thing is bad. having interests in common is important but it's also necessary that you have differences to be able to carry on a conversation
if you have the same opinion or thoughts being parroted back and forth it's going to get boring quick

You raise a good point, Anon. Differences are what keep things interesting.

sure.
but female version of me would be way higher value than i am.
<comment>
so you're emotionally attracted to yourself, but not physically? that's kinda interesting

a way taller me with a dick, with the same facial aesthetics etc ABSOLUTELY. chainmale knight sexo activate

The emotional connection mostly comes from the idea that she would be just as willing to be comfy with me. Then again, if she's just like me, we'd both be too afraid to initiate anything out of fear the other part doesn't want to.
But yeah, I don't think a female me would look all too great. She wouldn't have a nice-looking smile, and she'd have a lotta body hair. I guarantee she would also be really self-conscious about this and hate herself for it, even if nobody else really cares.

yes. I hate myself, but I don't necessarily hate the core aspects of myself. The lack of validation ever in my life spurs on my self-loathing and negative self-criticism. A female version of myself would be a stocky, athleticish, freckled, tomboyish, girl-next-door brunette - kinda my ideal type. Those features aren't valued on men.
I wouldn't mind meeting a female version of myself. It would get me to open up more about my interests that I often keep buried out of a sense of apathy and embarrassment. Enjoying it with someone else might be nice for once. I don't want to date myself though I would if given a chance. Ideally, I want someone who has different views on things. I want someone who is similar enough to me that there's some overlap, but I want them to bring me out of my comfort zone to get me to actually experience life. A female version of myself would likely just serve as an echo chamber for both my good qualities and bad. I want someone slightly different. I fear dating my female self will just serve as a feedback loop for our cyncism and isolation. I wouldn't mind being trapped together with someone else, but ideally I want someone to pull me out of that pit. At the end of the day though, misery loves company.

Are we asking if I'd date my clone, or if I really think I'm datable to the sort of women I'd want to date? For the former, no. You need enough similarities to get along, but enough differences to be interesting to one another. For the later, also no, I need to fix the job/career situation before I'm marketable to the sort of women I'd be interested in.
This was what I learned from OkCupid back when dating sites weren't shit. You'd go on a date with your top matches, people who matched 95%+ based on hundreds of questions, and yet you'd have zero spark.

Yeah, similarly to the reasons you have in your post, OP. I'm not too comfortable with intimacy and I'd want someone who was similar so we could at least get used to it together, instead of the alternative where they'll just drop me because I'm definitely not worth the effort.

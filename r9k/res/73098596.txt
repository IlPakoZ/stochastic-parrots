the current fashion for girlbosses and male bootlickers is clearly a psy-op designed to normalize femdom and women in positions of power
men are checking out of society and refusing to climb the social, education and corporate ladder, this is how the system wants to recuperate them

the whole point of girlbosses and femdom is that the guy is putting himself in that position. They're not LITERALLY stronger, unless its an anime where they have powers.

doesn't really work because the strong girlbosses still want an even more dominant and successful guy than them

physical strenght is not that important in the age of modern states and firearms. what will strenght give you if you can either be homeless and starve or submit to a girlboss and get your wages from her?

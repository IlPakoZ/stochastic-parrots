Darkweb free samples. New vendor has just popped up, offering .5g of coke, 1g k, mdma, 3mmc all for free, not even paying this one for postage. 
So I've nabbed the coke, gonna see if it lands ok and if so will be taking them up on all their other ones too. 
Also had my g of k and g of hash from a previous vendor land today. 
I'm going to have such a hefty stash of drugs and it will have cost me almost nothing.

trainspotting is kinda spot on with the intro speech about how life is gay and the end speech where he longs for a gay A4 life with taxes, TV, 9-5, golf, barbecues with people he dont give a fuck about etc.

<comment>
eh, its not a huge loss dying without trying it. chances are you'll have plenty of time using opioids when you're old.
its good but not that good, its just better than living for a lot of people. if you're functioning without it then starting is the dumbest thing you could ever do.
<comment>
what about dying without trying Salvia? I really wanna know what it feels like to be the floor or some other inanimate object for 1000 years
<comment>
Well yeah these are freebies to throw on top of the hoard I already have
<comment>
you're welcome to try but i'm just saying, my bucket list was just a bunch of drugs and alcohols and now that i've completed it i really wish i spent my time and money doing something else.
<comment>
Get really focused now.
<comment>
Salvia is a stupid drug, it's not fun it just is.
<comment>
Surely it's not drug specific, it's drug and experience. So do mdma at a rave, take acid in the forest, smoke weed on the beach etc, is a more sensible bucket list than just sitting in your room cramming chemicals into your drug hole
<comment>
ever tried meth from dw?
<comment>
anything i can do to make my low dose shroom trip more interesting? i only have like 1.5g left. thinking of comboing it with something

Lemon tek, it really works. Grind it into a fine powder if theyre dried and soak them in lemon juice for 30 minutes, stirring every few minutes. If theyre fresh then toss them in a blender and get it as fine as you can, be sure to get all of it out of the blender and do the same thing witn lemon juice. Itll hit you way faster, way more intensely and be much less of a body high and more visual/mental

Ever been on a heroin quest? How did it go? I once got hooked up with some H just by chance when I was in the city, and I'm wondering how easy it would be to just go back and start talking to obvious bums and druggies until someone helps me out.
<comment>
take a 1 week tolerance break and use the opportunity to shit
<comment>
eat less. its gonna take its time and there is little you can do about it so best not to pile on.
if you decide to do laxatives do not do more than one and dont do more than is recommended. i did a whole bunch of laxatives during my heroin constipation and it still took 16 hours before it came but goddamn it came with a vengeance, ended up shitting water for days. 
so yeah just accept that your intestines are sleeping and adjust your food intake in the future never eating much in one go.
<comment>
Never fucked with opiates before. I acquired those. Would they give me a good high and are they addictive/dangerous? I never took heroin, methadone etc.
Currently I'm only on alcohol, but last week I had a lsd trip. Well anyway back to my question, what's your opinion on Subutex (Buprenorphinum)?

opiates don't "stop you from feeling", when under the influence of them you feel nothing but pure, innocent childish bliss, I was wondering if opiates + psyches would essientially guarantee a really good trip

<comment>
what do you mean you cant make it work?
try having an empty stomach, accentuate it with grapefruit juice, make sure you are doing DXM only with no additives, listen to high bpm or deep bassline music to get that heart pumping, dont be afraid to hit the bathroom for puking/shitting, enjoy a hot shower while tripping
also, go higher than 500 mg dxm at minimum
what are you taking that isnt working, exactly?
<comment>
if you knew how it would change you, it wouldnt be necessary in the first place. you can only minimize the risk but there are no guarantees. assuming you are capable of genuine introspection without self deception, it should be beneficial.
<comment>
maxxing out at 420 mg
man you'll feel a little something something, but try doubling that

injecting heroin in ur butt
<comment>
what does that involve?
its nothing complex, just the basic shit like proper setting, dosage, perhaps prepare the environment a bit beforehand.
asking the right questions can increase the effectiveness of your introspection. like "what influences and habits are behind the way I am now" and "what changes can be introduced to my lifestyle to improve". having a mental goal wont really help if you dont understand your own fundamental nature. 
its incredibly easy to get carried away on tangential thoughts while tripping, because you enter this kind of flow state consciousness where your thoughts build and branch off eachother. when you lose a train of thought and try to backtrack, you have to start all the way from the beginning.
at this point im just rambling, its best not to go into any trip with expectations, your mind will kind of just "go" and you are along for the ride.
<comment>
gonna try shrooms this week because i wanted to do it for some reason. what is the experience like and what should i do on it? ive only done weed and alc. also im on ssris so i might have to take double the normal dose.

i've thought about it for months, but i'm scared shitless to try.
used to self harm so i'm worried about relapsing and fucking myself up during a bad trip, or driving my mental state down harder
having a mental goal wont really help if you dont understand your own fundamental nature.
it's more about creating the person i want to be out of who i am rather than a journey of self discovery. 
its incredibly easy to get carried away on tangential thoughts while tripping,
that's how i feel even in basic, sober meditation
its best not to go into any trip with expectations, your mind will kind of just "go" and you are along for the ride.
i don't have expectations but i have objectives. i have a goal person who i wish to be
<comment>
Yes, just stick to whatever your own and try when the course the completed
<comment>
well, its different for everyone so there isnt much use trying to compare. but for me, the most terrifying part by far is the initial "oh shit, oh fuck, i feel like im leaving my body and everything that can be known or understood behind". things that might spook me while sober seem like a joke in comparison. 
the trip itself wont do anything but show you information about yourself and allow you to formulate a plan. setting lofty expectations or goals in this state can be a mistake, because you might get back into sober and be like "holy fuck, i need to upend my entire lifestyle and routine from the very roots" and shit becomes way too overwhelming. 
but thats just me, you do you nigga. its a personal journey the whole way. i tripped like 8 times before "getting the message"
<comment>
i think its because ssri's release serotonin and so do certain drugs, like shrooms, so you basically get serotonin poisoning.
<comment>
wrong kind of serotonin. it would be dangerous to take MDMA for that reason.
SSRIs downregulate 5HT2A, causing a significantly blunted trip.
<comment>
as long as i don't become schizophrenic or start cutting myself or become a christcuck i guess it should be fine
ironically a lot of the reasons i'm terrified of going on shrooms are the same things i want to fix. i'm an anxious, aggressive, self destructive pile of shit
the trip itself wont do anything but show you information about yourself and allow you to formulate a plan.
the way i view this is that it's a tool to help facilitate mental changes
i'm taking "self transformation" quite literally. any insight or new perspectives would be a result of neurological change.
i want to develop interests in things i don't have interests in now 
i want to change thought patterns so that way i don't get pissed off at shit that doesn't really matter. 
i want to stop spiraling into negative thought loops like a whiny bitch
i want to actually have any semblance of self control or awareness
i can't understand how the person i want to be thinks or acts. i know vaguely what they are like, but i can't feel their emotions. i want to be them

If I want to try shrooms, is it worth actually growing them (I'll have to wait to grow/harvest), or should I just buy them?
<comment>
idk sounds like youre ready.
what makes you say that
idk i just don't want to do something stupid. i used to cut myself, i constantly think about killing myself, and i get angry at the slightest of things
to minimize risk i guess i'd just lay in my bed the entire trip, but i guess i'm just terrified of screwing this up
<comment>
4-HO-MiPT and 4-HO-MET >>> shrooms
<comment>
as a second opinion, honestly you sound kinda fucked in the head, would not recommend psychedelics because any lasting "self-transformation" IMO is for the most part a meme that only works if you aren't already fucked in the head. its kinda like therapy in that regard but you also run the risk of becoming even more fucked in the head. 
even if you do get some benefit from a change in perspective you're more likely than not going to go back to your old shitty patterns if you're expecting mushrooms to really change who you are. I don't think its possible to become a different person than the one you already are, I just don't think that's how it works. and you're just asking for a bad trip if you go into psychedelics with that mindset. 
psychedelics, like therapy let's say, are primarily about "self-discovery" as opposed to "self-transformation". self-discovery is supposed to induce self transformation, transformation just doesn't happen magically because you ate some mushrooms, self transformation is a lifelong and ongoing process.
of course you can change your behavior and thought patterns with concerted and sustained effort (in theory at least) but that's not going to happen because a switched was turned on in your brain after a trip, and that's not changing "who you are" - whatever that means anyways.
<comment>
ok then dont take it? i was thinking about blowing my brains out daily, it had little relevance to my trips besides deciding that i actually dont want to do that or think about it so i stopped.
<comment>
buprenorph is fucking great. it had the most euphoria out of any opioid i've taken. 2nd place going to hydromorphone. hydromorph has a nicer warmness feeling and a better nod though
you're lucky to have subutex, cus its straight buprenorph whereas suboxone has buprenorph + naloxone in it to prevent abuse. 
do you really have subutex? i thought they were discontinued like 10 years ago. or do you just have generic buprenorphine?
<comment>
yeah miprocin is my favourite tryptamine by far apart from maybe DPT. metocin is close 2nd too. i think i prefer 4-HO-DET to regular psilocin too. 4-HO-DiPT is a unique one too but its not nearly as fun as shrooms, just different.
<comment>
fuck I feel mad anxiety after writing this out reliving my retarded insane psychedelic trips which caused me to set my life on fire lmao.
<comment>
i mean its really unlikely it'll make you become delusional or psychotic. if you trust yourself not to hurt yourself while you're sober, it likely won't be any different high with the exception of maybe mania inducing drugs or if you happen to be predisposed to psychotic illnesses. 
it seems to me there's no big reason not to take trip. thats just my perspective though. you seem otherwise entirely prepared for high introspection so you're already a step ahead most people who have never tripped before.
and remember your dosage with psychedelics can be whatever you want. you can ease into the experience. you don't have to have some life changing trip first go. you can just eat like 0.5-1g of shrooms and test the waters so you can understand vaguely what its like to be in a psychedelic headspace. obviously a low dose trip is hard to compare to a higher dose one, but it will eliminate some anxiety about taking higher doses and it will give you at least some insight into how you'll react to taking psychedelics.
i've also tripped when i was the most genuinely suicidal i had ever been and it never really affected any of my trips. it was either i'd forget about suicide or the idea of killing myself would seem so strange and alien that i would, for that moment at least, have 0 suicidal ideation.
<comment>
psychedelics, like therapy let's say, are primarily about "self-discovery" as opposed to "self-transformation". self-discovery is supposed to induce self transformation, transformation just doesn't happen magically because you ate some mushrooms, self transformation is a lifelong and ongoing process.
this is 100% correct
<comment>
how do you guys take your phenibut and how often?
<comment>
you would benefit from ego dissolution maybe. it seems you're in the ballpark. but there is no "you". you will not change who "you" are because there is no one to become and no one to be. 
i get what you mean but if you take a bunch of mushrooms you will cease to become anybody for at least a couple hours.
<comment>
there is no one to become and no one to be.
I know this is all high and mighty new age speak, and it's certainly true in some regard but for people who are kinda fucked in the head (*cough* personality disordered) I think it's a dangerous thought to entertain especially in a psychedelic headspace. Humans need an ego and a some conception of a "you" to function in the world, otherwise we would all be full blown schizophrenics. You also need a good conception of a "you" begin eradicating it as the eastern sages and mystics did.
<comment>
How does 4-HO-DET compare to 4-HO-MET? I haven't tried 4-HO-DET yet, but I heard it has the lightest headspace of any of the 4-sub tryptamines.
<comment>
I don't think its possible to become a different person than the one you already are
a lot of people, especially those who take psychedelics seem to say that. i'm no neuroscientist but the way i see things is that we are just biological machinery. there are some mechanisms that are hard to change, and others that are easy. 
of course you can change your behavior and thought patterns with concerted and sustained effort (in theory at least)
that's the point for me. i just am looking for tools to assist with this change.
mental change is the result of biochemical change. psychs may just be a tool to facilitate said change or help break down certain pathways that were reinforced
deciding that i actually dont want to do that or think about it
it's an intrusive thought that comes when i'm upset at myself or spiraling into self destructiveness
when i actually sit down and think about things in a calm manner, i know i want to live
so i stopped.
the feelings just completely went away?
i'm curious but you don't have to talk about it if it's not good for you to do so
you happen to be predisposed to psychotic illnesses.
i wouldn't know how to find out
you seem otherwise entirely prepared for high introspection
i'm not sure since what i want out of psychs is the opposite of what many anons say the point is
idk i'm a huge pussy about this stuff i'm like trying to make the conditions as perfect as possible to not fuck up
what's the difference between that and just dissociation?
<comment>
or help break down certain pathways that were reinforced
this only lasts as long as the drugs. which is why its incredibly easy to fall back into bad habits knowingly, immediately. you are still responsible for applying all the effort necessary to "change yourself" in sober life
<comment>
Humans need an ego and a some conception of a "you" to function in the world
thats incredibly far from the truth, really not sure what this claim is based on. unless your definition of function is being a productive wageslave
<comment>
tfw you have no friends or networking opportunities so you have only ever tried weed at 25 yrs old even though youve been desperately wanting to try shrooms and mdma for years
<comment>
this only lasts as long as the drugs.
at least some people claim that it had a lasting effect on their mental health, i'm not saying "i'll just take shrooms then i will change myself forever" i mean this might just help be a primer for change.
i know fuck all about cognitive science or how to trip though. this is all just stuff that's been in my head for a while now
you are still responsible for applying all the effort necessary to "change yourself" in sober life
not implying otherwise.

Drink roughly 1.75 liters of liquor every 5-10 days since December
Never experience anything negative from the drinking and no symptoms when I took tolerance breaks
Decide to quit anyway cuz alcohol bad
Nothing changes; no improvements on anything in life
Now I'm just slightly more depressed and bored more often
I might just become a functional alcoholic bros.

if you keep up your same drinking habits for a few more years you will lose everything you are currently taking for granted that you dont even realize
<comment>
i'm curious but you don't have to talk about it if it's not good for you to do so
I mean it's not going to be relevant to you probably but I feel like writing a blog post to relax a bit. I really don't mean to sound like an edgy teenager, I promise. 
I've had maybe a dozen LSD and mushroom trips where I guess I was trying to reach some catharsis or understanding about why I've always felt kind "off' my entire life so to speak, kind of like everyone else had a soul and I didn't, everyone else was capable of bonding with other people and I was just faking it.
For some reason throughout my entire life I completely stopped talking to and basically ghosted everyone I've ever known, from acquaintances to my closest friends, even family. I didn't really know why at the time but it just felt like its what I was supposed to do, it was really easy for me to decide that the other person didn't give a fuck about me to begin with, or was using me for something, they never enjoyed talking to me and neither did I enjoy talking to them. Even if that wasn't true at all and I did enjoy their company. I just felt like everyone was a tumor that I had to cut off of me so I could be myself and stop putting up an act for them to enjoy.
After some number of trips I realized something really wasn't right about that and I just remember one mushroom trip sitting in the park alone and just imagining someone coming up to me with a gun, or my family dying, and how little I would give a fuck. Like just thinking, if my entire family died I'm not sure if I would be phased even for a split second, stuff like that. I guess I connected that to the reason that it was so easy for me to cut off all of my friendships.
The only coherent story that psychedelics gave me to explain my behavior was that I literally didn't care about anyone, that I was completely self-contained. Nobody ever knew me and nobody ever will because I am barely a person, I am constitutionally incapable of connection.
<comment>
Yeah I figured. Life is just boring when you're totally sober. Maybe I'll maintain 2 weeks on 2 weeks off schedule. That way I'm only technically drinking for half my life.
<comment>

Which is to some extent kind of true when I actually put my ducks in a row and try to give an account for my shitty behavior as well how my parents taught me to view other people. But it also made it seem perfectly reasonable to ghost my last remaining friend, who I've known since I was like 5 years old and spent a lot of time with and really enjoyed the company of. I decided he was just using me and our entire lifelong connection was forged. I had to prove it to myself that I never cared about him and that I was really that shitty of a guy so I just stopped talking to him out of nowhere. 
Honestly I might have done that without psychedelics but the insight they gave me really wasn't something I needed or wanted to know. Although now that I think about it at least I know it now... not sure if I would have otherwise. But it also sent me into a years long kind of psychotic spiral which I coped with by holing myself in my room even more than I was already doing.
I don't know where I'm going with this. I've come to the conclusion that I think I have a personality disorder lol and I'll be fucked if anyone has ever cured a PD using psychedelics. Anyways...
<comment>
duhhhhh you need "ego",some unproven jungian theory is what we should all base our worldview on
also im too lazy to present an actual argument lol
settle down there faggotron, your ego is acting up.
go check out the thousand+ year written record of zen tradition and then you can have an opinion on the topic.
<comment>
what's the difference between that and just dissociation?
its basically the opposite of dissociation. you're getting the wrong idea. i recommend reading about ego death/dissolution
<comment>
i don't think i can relate to a lot of this, but i appreciate you sharing.
i'm too out of it to give my own life story but i guess for me i really started to hate myself and the feeling that i have to change because i don't want to be like this forever is slowly eating at me
I've come to the conclusion that I think I have a personality disorder lol and I'll be fucked if anyone has ever cured a PD using psychedelics. Anyways...
yeah. if it turns out i'm BPD or something like that, don't really want to say i'm hopeless
<comment>
it is a really light headspace, lighter than 4-HO-MET. i'd compare the headspace most to 4-HO-MiPT. but 4-HO-DET is really cool its very stimulating and has a very weird but nice body high. its an electric sort of energy, reminiscent of LSD or ETH-LAD but i wouldn't say its specifically like either of those drugs. colours aren't as vivd as 4-HO-MET, less visual overall and maybe less potent. its a pretty unique one. combines nice with MDMA
<comment>
my point wasn't that his ego should eradicated forever, i meant to emphasize the "at least for a couple hours" part because if he thinks shrooms will change who he is or he'll gain some deep understanding of who he is isn't really accurate. i just meant he'd likely have ego dissolution and become literally nobody, and not find out much about who he "is" or whatever. 
and there is literally no way to get rid of your ego forever, in my opinion. my point was more just he had a misunderstanding about what introspection / "self" exploration is like on something like mushrooms.
but i don't know, pyschs are different for everyone.
<comment>
he'd likely have ego dissolution and become literally nobody, and not find out much about who he "is"
the funny part is when you really get into this, you really were nobody all along. this tends to clash with alot of people's expectations going into psychs, causing much confusion
<comment>
thats what i was getting at essentially. i dont think anybody is anything more than a reaction to the events around them.
<comment>
if you define "ego" as western psychologists did, then its impossible to have no ego without being extremely mentally ill. im not sure if the word ego has much significance in buddhism anyways it seems more like a western conception. no-self is different than no-ego
<comment>
also I take back what I said about conception of "you"
but you kinda need to have some inner constructs of how you relate to the world and yourself, whether you attempt to describe them with language and symbols or not
the point of the zen traditions is to realize that all the constructs you have are an illusion. but recognizing something as illusory and completely getting rid of it aren't the same thing are they?
<comment>
is it something that can be read about or has to be experienced?
i dont think anybody is anything more than a reaction to the events around them.
unless you believe in something like a soul, i think we're just biological machines.
we're just complicated neural networks which react to stimuli. how we react comes from how that network is wired.
and therefore i looked towards psychs as a tool for assisting with the rewiring of the mind. the question i ask which pushed me was is there some part of me that could reset, forget how to think in the ways i don't want, and learn how to think the way i want to?
i've accepted i'm not who i wish to be, and it would take a lot to change that. biochemical problems may require biochemical solutions
<comment>
so this is the first search result for the definition of jungian ego
Jung saw the ego as the centre of the field of consciousness which contains our conscious awareness of existing and a continuing sense of personal identity. It is the organiser of our thoughts and intuitions, feelings, and sensations, and has access to memories which are not repressed.
and here is a quote describing "no self"
"The conditionally generated experiences of the mind do not come from anywhere within the ten directions, nor do they go anywhere. When you can regularly observe thinking, discrimination, deluded views, feelings, random thoughts, and confusion as not individually substantive mental events, then your practice is becoming basically stable. If you can settle the mind and remain free of entanglement with this continual conditioned thinking, you will be serene and fully aware, and discover an end to your afflictions. This is called liberation."
-the Ju Dao An Xin Yao Fang Pien Fa Men, a summary of Daoxin's teachin
obviously you cant "remove" the ego, but its certainly possible to become completely disengaged from it. from the subjective point of view, it is no longer there.

smoking meth, fentanyl and weed tonight. waiting until enough time has passed without fentanyl so i can take a piss and have an epic fap sesh on meth. pic related
<comment>
see this>>73089914
but also add an MAOI like syrian rue to increase the effects. even 1.5g in lemon tek is going to be underwhelming, imo.
<comment>
i didn't get /opi/ constipation as badly on heroin as i do with fentanyl. generally, i will use for 7-10 days then take 3-5 days off in order to be able to shit otherwise i cannot shit and have zero urge to shit while using fetty. chances of shitting are more likely to occur during that first week of not shitting with the aid of something like miralax rather than trying to take it after a week of using and your shit sitting in you for a week. if all else fails, buying a saline enema works wonders even after 2.5 weeks of constipation i had once.
<comment>
as a heroin and fentanyl addict that has abused subutex and suboxone without an opioid tolerance, i found bupe to be an underwhelming high that isn't a genuine opioid high in itself. that said, it will give a mildly euphoric body high and accompanying nausea. it's also quite strong so there's no need to take more than 1-2mg.
i really enjoy heroin with shrooms because they're both sedating. i really enjoy meth with acid because they're both stimulating. i have enjoyed the heroin nod on acid as well. but i have never been able to enjoy fentanyl on acid. it's like they're both fightign to compete for stimulant vs depressant in my head and hurt my brain.

Illegal rave I went to Sunday got raided! Luckily I managed to get myself and my girlfriend out. Also managed to also get a couple people fucked on ket out safe so defo did my part. Surprised I survived, had tons of E and speed. Picrel.

I know that feel, bro. Now I have good friends but they are all done with drugs and will not to them with me. I think I've guilted my best friend into doing acid the other day since he kind of bought it up. We'll see.

Does anyone know why stims make you more crafty after using them as the days go by? I've been smoking crack once because my pocket couldn't hold my powdered coke habit anymore, all without building up a tolerance to it and I am not psychologically dependent on crack, one or two rocks stimulates me to alarming levels, as soon as that tiny rock melts while I suck hard and emits the crippling sound, I am forced to move the pipe upwards to prevent it from falling rock from falling out of the crevice where it is placed. I have learned many things after using this, my ways of creating things and dealing with them have become more simplified, for example if I want to build a homemade pipe because I just can't find myself smoking in some shitty tube made from a antenna TV together with a paper filter that burns my mouth, I can even make pipes with pieces of paper and aluminum.

Sometimes certain situations in life lead you to do things that you would never imagine.
In the street you quickly learn that there is nothing cheaper and more profitable than crack.I already know by heart their mode of operating(the dealers) as well as the characteristics of each rock that I have had in my hand, the sellers and users of crack cocaine are the most subtle, intelligent and ruthless group of addicts there can be. 
They are master minds in merchandise strategy, as well as making deliveries in broad daylight, they know how to psychologically control their clientele. 
I have stories to tell about it.After

it feels a lot like an opioid high at 600-900mg if you don't have much of a tolerance, definitely mind numbing at that point
you would feel a lot better, start with 225-300mg

How do you deal with the comedowns? It's so brutal as they say? And also, how do you know if your rock is good or bad?
<comment>
Yeah, London. Lights were off (we had strobes and lasers up) before they rocked in, once we saw how many TSG were outside we switched the light on to pack the rig because we knew there would be a raid. Also there's way more people than you'd think from the pic, that picture was taken by one of the last people leaving, there were tons more cops behind that you can't see too. Pic unrelated, this is one I went to early march, same group.
<comment>
mad I know a few ppl who organise london squats. I used to go to them a few years ago when lucigenic n ravers purge were really active but I fucking hate london would take a free party in the country anyday over one of them scatty squats
<comment>
not the crack head but most will swear by having downers to ease the comedown like benzos (xanax) or opioids (heroin/fentanyl). these drugs work wonders for any crash/comedown i get from meth or pcp.
<comment>
love doing way too much of a substance, namely weed or psychedelics
like too much to the point where you literally cant do anything and have to just sit there and experience the induced schizophrenia
everyone else just likes doing enough to be bubbly funny haha
So do i just always do it alone? No one else likes diving headfirst into the abyss?

Looks like a sausage fest, why even bother?

Yes, hello. Me and the abyss are very well acquainted. I take over 10g of shrooms when I trip.

Turns out 300mg pregabalin, bit of coke, ketamine and hash is a pretty heavy combo. Think I'll be locked on the couch for the foreseeable.

Best thing you can do is get to a rave then ask around for a Telegram you can join. Once you've got into any telegram you can usually ask around in the group for local events, or maybe even a local Telegram group.

Newly experienced crack user here.
I self medicate with weed, whether I'm dealing with WD symdrome from another substance I'm addicted or decide to smoke crack, a whole joint of sativa weed along with a rock of ground crack inside it is one of the best wonders I've discovered, I avoid physiological collapse and at the same time I don't lose weight more than usual because I get hungry at the end.
<comment>
haha thats where im from there's a good chance I know the crews you're talking about =)

Cheers lad, will give it a go. Got a house and a wife and a dog so rare that I can get out so have to make the most of it when I do.

Will vaping my own cum get me high?

We're back baby, drank some wine, let the k wear off, dinner, another bump of coke. Bit more hash soon and we'll be sorted.
<comment>
Are you made of weed?
<comment>
If I say yes, will that mean that vaping my own cum will get me high???
<comment>
my stimulant of choice is meth due to euphoria, the duration of the high, the body high, the price and the relaxing nature of the high. crack i find to be too overstimulating in an uncomfortable way and coke snorted to be a bit underwhelming/waste. but IV coke is quite enjoyable. generally, i like to have a downer such as fentanyl or xanax when taking stimulants to balance out the high and particularly to help sleep when it's waring off.
<comment>
dredge
is that a new version of dread or did you just make a typo
<comment>
It pleases me to know that there are still open-minded users in these threads and that they naturally and passively accept other substances that are "unacceptable" even among other drug users, crack addicts (who already have many years of experience in it) are usually harshly marginalized socially, it is natural that due to this constant mistreatment/rejection of people they always walk on the defensive with the rest of the world.
<comment>
Loads of people who live near me have clocked I'm into booze. Part of me is embarrassed the other part just couldn't give less of a fuck wahey go on the lads

No, your just anxious. Weed actually dilates the blood vessels which would lower the chance of a heart attack (MI) however your heart rate can increase to compensate and this increased heart rate causes alot of people to freak out.

anybody "grow out" of drugs?
from 2012-recently was smoking/vaping tons of weed, taking dabs of high quality concentrates, loved tripping on LSD/shrooms once or twice a month, 2cb, DMT
life felt like a mystical party
Now when I do drugs I just feel this strong sense of regret and wish I was sober, even with weed. It just doesn't give me that mystical feeling anymore
Taking shrooms and cuddling with my gf naked while listening to music was one of the best feelings in the world, or taking 2cb/mdma and giving each other oil massages and having sex all night long.
Now it just feels different and the magic is gone. Did I just grow out of this phase?
<comment>
Can you forage for shroom in the woods? I know that fields with cows on them are the best, but I don't want some asshole farmer to shoot me without warning because I was "trespassing".

The depression's been hitting pretty hard lately, so I'm not sure that I can handle growing anything right now. I was hoping that foraging could be an option since I can work myself up to do something like that.

you can but you're not going to. fly agaric is hard to come by. I agree with >>73105684

update;
Today I fell some money after being broke for more than a week, I did not hesitate to fill the bag of my previous order to put the 4 rocks of crack that I bought, but I was presented with a somewhat complicated situation to travel by bus and I I had to go on foot for about 2 km to get my things + a 0.6g of weed. 
I would like to share a photo of my little chunks but some jannie I left with his ass butthurted at some past event of my stay here, she take away my privilege of posting photos here.
But going back to the topic, sometimes they resemble a pointed shape on the edges and with the size of a grain, in which do you think this material was made? in a spoon, microwave, pairex molds? they resemble mini-cubes of sugar,other times they look like bits of soap or solid wax, they are very dense to the touch or if I opt for grind them, as it is already known that crack does not have a way of testing before using it, unlike other drugs, unless you are determined to set that pipe on fire and cross your fingers that you don't get a sudden stroke or heart attack, my tolerance for this has not yet been programmed into my brain and I don't intend to become dependent on it because it would further worsen my reputation,also, the smell of crack is too noticeable, it smells like a burnt rubber along with a nauseating stench of burned chemicals, hyperhidrosis worsens the bad smell in my clothes,I have to pour fucktons of perfume to hide it.
I gonna continue to use it recreationally without getting to the level of wanting to smoke it just a few minutes after getting up from my mattress.

American culture is centered around niggers. They have holidays for niggers. They killed hundreds of thousands of white men to free niggers. They listen to nigger music. They elect a nigger as their president. They dress and act like niggers. They draw the entirety of their modern culture from niggers. They post sassy gifs about niggers. They watch sportsball in worship of niggers. Their biggest event of the year involves throwing parties in honor of niggers playing sports. They use nigger slang like "bruh" and "thot". When you say "Martin Luther" they're not thinking of the father of protestantism. They're thinking of the nigger. Their cities are completely overrun with niggers. They worship their ZOGbot police force disproportionately filled with niggers and their global police force of soldiers filled with niggers. Their men sit around watching nigger ball while their women sit around watching nigger talk shows. They worship niggers like Muhammad Ali and Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson and the late Eddie Murphy while attacking the whites who actually built their country before niggers took over. Their movies are filled with niggers and their music charts are topped by niggers. They send niggers to the Olympics and celebrate when the niggers win because those niggers are true red blooded american niggers. They watch nigger porn to a point where "BBC" does not make them think of an international media company but about nigger penises instead. They will tell you how much they hate niggers and how the mutt's law meme is a stale joke and they are just pretending to love niggers but the evidence speaks for itself in that America has always been and will be a nation of nigger loving niggersAmerican culture is centered around niggers. They have holidays for niggers.

i have about 300mg of 4aco dmt in pressed tablets, each 20mg. 
im supposedly not supposed to break the tablets into pieces, any idea why? there was a warning on the package. i want to try just taking a really small amount before i sleep, like 1-2 mg, and not a full trip.

LSD after failing the exams and getting a good night's sleep. Accept that you have fucked things up and now need to slowly fix them.
<comment>
Basically the same as tramadol,, is a pretty nice high but tolerance goes up shockingly quickly and before you know it you're taking 300mg just to feel a slight warmth. 
Start slow, if you've not got much opiate tolerance 50mg is probably good. Avoid doing it too regularly, once a week would be ideal.
<comment>
It's going to be shit unless you have robotablets or delsym.

It's a deliriant so high doses are a bad idea for 99% of people.
<comment>
3-4g is the sweet spot for recreational use as a stimulant, 1.5g is good for using it as an anxiolytic. It's recommended to wait at least a day in between uses but it's probably smarter to wait 2-3 days. Redosing can make it more effective but you don't want to exceed 5g in one day. You don't want to use phenibut habitually, the withdrawal can cause seizures and if you only take it for a few days there are reports of rebound anxiety. It takes 3-5 hours to take effect, sometimes longer if you've eaten so don't redose until at least 4 hours have past and be conservative with your redosing. 1.5g feels very mild but 4g is potent.

opiates don't actually cause any physical harm long term besides dependence and "social harm" is just bullshit related to the drug war they use to demonize substances that retards can't handle
the drug war is essentially an infantalization of humanity, only QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS aka government approved agents can handle this and if you try you're a criminal. It's retard tier logic normies think they're big brained by agreeing with, it's a circlejerk we suffer the effects of daily

<comment>
I wish all stimfags a very pleasant and twitchy evening.

I just had the most fucked up kratom dream where I was tripping extremely hard and stumbling around my house and my body was morphing extremely quickly and forcefully. I felt the body high and everything, That was the most intense experience of my life and it was a kratom dream, What the fuck?
Have any of you guys experienced this? I've done psychs before but I've never experienced anything that intense, I think I thought I was dreaming for part of it and trying to wake up but I couldn't. I really felt like I was flailing about my room. I even went in my bathroom and looked in the mirror and saw my head morph and sqaush like someone was fucking with a cgi model in blender, I felt it too.
<comment>
Yeah, I think I do. I wouldn't take that much if it was fucking me up. I should have been a little more clear that that's not normal for most people.
<comment>
Vodka technically has the least adulterants and sulphites, but that of course depends on the quality of vodka you're drinking. Proper tequila is supposedly an upper rather than a depressant, but not sure on the science behind that, might be made up. 
Personally for shots I prefer tequila, vodka on the rocks for sipping. No noticeable difference on getting drunk faster as they're about the same abv, personal experience I found that drinking vodka at a wedding meant my hangover wasn't bad at all, but I might have just had enough water or eaten enough or been lucky.

Had my first opiate withdrawal. It was pussy shit but still pretty not enjoyable. Reminds me of the beginning with benzodiazepene abuse. Can't say I won't be back, but I'm feeling a bit cautious after that one.
<comment>
Level of withdrawal depends on level of dependency, had some pretty mild ones compared to benzos and phenibut, and also had some absolutely brutal ones.

I've always wanted to try coke but I have such a shitty heart and I suffer from anxiety, I would probably just have a panic attack that I was having a heart attack. Best of luck to you though, and why do you get yourself into these predicaments? Don't just joke about it, actually search your mind for the answer and ways you can better yourself.
I wish everyone a very pleasant evening, well morning here.
Why trip?
I normally have vivid dreams almost every other night, I did notice they tend to be more crazy/frequent when j did kratom.
You're a wise man, good luck anon.
<comment>
Because I'm dumb and I love drugs. Will be cutting myself off soon, clearing out all the stuff that's abusable and will be having an only alcohol and weed break for my general health. Cheers for the concern, all the best

Many mafias became legal breweries 
Meatsacks? That is the opposite of the future. Were achieving absolute divinity for all
The most soulful utopias
I trust Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians, Russians, Dixie, commies, Nazis, true Americans, and whites in general more than I trust Israel and its doomed fake religion of fake morals.
Every girl is a god.
The only god is love.
I love girls, not Israel kings and Israels kings books of bullshit.
Yin-Yang is the same as do unto others as youd have done unto yourself. Without that quote, the book is garbage, and with that quote the book is worse than garbage because it is all hypocrisy anyways.
Ahh yes do unto others as youd have done unto yourself and uh we think genocide is ok. Nah
Edomites overrule Israels bullshit and bull shit religions.
I bless all Edomite victory
And tomboy Dixie Satan
What was the book mad at Satan for? Something about Satan being kinda mean sometimes and making Israel TOO butthurt. Gosh are Palestinians and white Americans the devil?
Then I bless that the devil wins all and we get true religions that actually evolve.
The only motive and god is love.
Tomboy Jesus loves licking my ass for eternity in hell, so she better learn to bless to be blessed and bless the devil instead of cursing tomboy Dixie Satan and being cursed

I bless that hell becomes the truest heaven 
And becomes its truest love
I love the soul of heaven for all.
True love
There is infinite loves yet simultaneously infinite loves that are infinite one loves.
Infinite abstract singularity
Lets make hell perfect.
Hell is Ohio
Hell is Palestine 
Hell is Paris (but the revolution is impressive and I feel hell is becoming true paradise etc)
Hmm
There is infinite worlds/souls to develop the love of. Not merely a false dichotomy of heaven and hell. I do not feel heaven is true if hell is a truly bad place.
After all, the only motive is love. The devil is love too.
The greatest hate can only be felt by those who feel the greatest love contrasting it.
Sadness and fear and pain only exist in souls that love.
A tear is a sign of love.
Pain is never felt by those who do not love.
<comment>
Call me normality, we are never going away.
True 4chan and the true internet etc is forever too.
<comment>
I bless that true community and true religion (religion that evolves) is ever more overt and outgoing
The only god is love.
The only motive is love.
The only power/drive/force is love.
A thought is a soul.
All is infinitely abstract.
We can make infinite religions of loveliest love and funnest fun and truest goodness and most moral morality off of just a few good statements and its infinite other statements they spark and feed
Etc 
Etc
Everyone has insights of the truest truth.
Lets all progress 
Lets all love our loveliest love forever.

I wonder how long until this fag decides to off himself

Lets discuss the queendom of Ohio and its whims and wants and wills and loves and morality and gods and paradise and divinity and plan and chosen purpose. Forevermore.
Also Detroit and Chicago and really every devil.
Every region of the world is a god.
All is god and a god.
Love/god is simultaneously infinitely abstract and absolute.
Ohio is god.

All drugs and potions are destined to become legal in the USA and globally.

<comment>
Instead of bleach, fluoride, and chlorine. . . put LSD and shroom juice (politely known as shroom female-cum/ejaculate) and DMT in the water supply.
Shrooms have always made me think of clits.
New strains coming out across Canada have clit in the name. Such as Canadian Clit. 
Canadians love transhumanism biopunk divinity progress and investment. Soon Canadians will be able to elongate their clits and impregnate anyone.
Canada is a female absolutist society and is utmost feminist/nazi.
I love Canada.
Maybe Canada will annex Ohio to protect them. People of Alaska are rallying to join Canada. Free healthcare and all drugs legal and not having all your wealth stolen for fake wars by foreign forces. . . so worth it.
I love neutral-libertarian-nazi-commie always and forever, it is so true American.

it is a really light headspace, lighter than 4-HO-MET. 
i'd compare the headspace most to 4-HO-MiPT.
4-HO-MiPT tends to have a deep headspace in my experience, almost as deep as shrooms or 4-AcO-DMT, so that's kind of a weird comparison if 4-HO-DET has a light headspace. Does 4-HO-MiPT not have much headspace whenever you do it?

Does 4-HO-MiPT not have much headspace whenever you do it?
yeah for me it was always super light. its a weird headspace, it has a tendency to really immerse me in my visuals but it was always in a fun and sort of relaxing way. sometimes the intensity and immersion in the visuals would bring me deeper into a heavier headspace, but it was always something i could snap out of if i wanted to. whereas something like 4-HO-MET would be like a cycle where my immersion in my own thoughts would have the same effect, just less controllable.

1-2 mg
thats below threshold dose for sure
but there's no reason you can't break them up if you want. they probably just don't want people smashing them and then fucking up their sinuses snorting pill filament or binding agents or whatever.
how are you gonna eyeball a mg off a press anyway?

in pellet form instead of powder
would be a hard find right now. some RC sites carry dimethocaine and phenmetrazines, but its not gonna be pressed. there really aren't any good RC stims in canada anyway. onions are the way to go. unless you're okay with phenethylamines, but those will be in powder too.

As other anon said any opi will help.
I suggest taking kratom, it will barely help but it beats just trading an opi for an opi and if you're really lucky with your genetics it might actually stop all withdrawals.
<comment>
Can't argue with that logic. 
Eurgh, 2.5g of phenibut of the course of the day, 300mg gapapentin and 400mg of soma and a couple of glasses of wine.
Was watching succession with the gf and very nearly nodded off, had to sneak upstairs to do a bump as to not alert the gf. 
Lucky I didn't actually nod out, did for a few seconds last week on pregabalin and weed but as it was 420 I could blame it on that. 
Anyway cheers you bunch of crackheads, junkies and hippies. Hope you're having a splendid time.

How safe is it to order shrooms of the deepweb? Am I better off just growing them myself with spores? In minecraft.

Nobody cares but I bought dmt I'm going to try and breakthrough tonight
<comment>
It shouldnt be an issue.
Only some beings who shouldnt be alive would try to oppose you from buying shrooms. Maybe such beings are too lowly to exist. Unimaginable that some beings are so lowly they fear the slightest true consciousness. It is probably all good for you to buy deepweb shrooms. Though, ask friends in your region.
But growing from spores is fun and easy and a useful wisdom.
It is awesome that people spread shrooms around across forests.

all that profound shit/near to discovering the secret is bullshit
Did dmt really make you guys see/feel this way? I really have not smoked enough at once because the most I've gotten is sounds are very cool, in the light distortion I saw part of a face but the first time I hit a DMT vape, which is apparently a bad way to do dmt, while staring at my wall it got distorted then I rapidly went through a bunch of different versions of my room where it was a different art style each time. That only lasted 3 or 4 minutes and I'm told I should actually be tripping for about 20-30 minutes. I tried using a pipe and that wasted a lot of my powder last time but I have my rig now but I'm wondering how hot I have to make my bowl because lots of DMT was caught in the pipes last time. I know that's unrelated to your post but tripping for me has always just been a fun way to decompress my mind and just see what's out there. Yeah it may not be real or whatever but I think just enjoying those WOAH DUDE moments is just part of the experience. I'm really hoping I experience what most people had on dmt today.

Nazism is every goodness and society.
Every success Israel achieved is via Israeli Nazism.
Every true USA American is a populist-patriot-Nazi. To attack such core ideas of any society is merely an attack against society. Israel tried to kill America via attacking Americas Nazis.
There is no society without a mixture of Nazism-Libertarianism-Communism and progressive-populism and liberal-conservatism. Etc.
Many dichotomy are false dichotomy intended to create division and the destruction of a society.
Every girl is a god. All is god.
Every love is a god.

However Judaism cultists have a particularly moronic soulless rendition of god they call Yahweh. A god that is evil but supposedly does not hurt the Jews sometimes if the Jews do stupid gimmicks, like mutilating their dicks and following soulless rituals and being a mindless cancer that curses everyone.
They also wrote the genocides they did was Yahwehs will and yet the genocides they suffered was somehow not.
Really any symbol that implies some kind of love and thriving. . . is a swastika.
An apple is a swastika. An eye is a swastika. A clit and an orgasm is a swastika.
Judaism only exists via fear, confusion, and the Jews being deprived of alternatives.
All the lost Jewish tribes and lost Jewish religions were genocided by Judaism cultists.
Including by the founder of Judaism known as Moses who kill half of all the jews because the jews decided to make a baby cow statue and started to thrive other thoughts/loves/spirits instead of worshiping the old monster Moses as the only voice of god rather than their lovers.
A baby cow is god.
A flower is god.
A girl is god.
Lovers are god.
All such things are swastikas. The love of love, the will to thrive, love, and live.
After the Holocaust we should have admitted that Judaism was what killed the Jews and liberated the Jews from Judaism.
I love religions that progress and evolve and prosper every goodness.

I have half of two rocks left from my later order, I cut them in half, a single small particle is enough for me, I suck all inside that yellow chunks up and I go crazy-estimulated for 4-7 minutes maximum (if it is whole it lasts like 20 or sometimes more depending on how pure it is), I have been told that to realize if a rock is good, it should melt quickly when put at a high temperature, as if it were oily. This habit is like jumping into Russian roulette.

I wonder how much the suicidal spam is you, huck.
If you do not want immortality via transhumanism and fear progress, then you simply do not belong on my world nor among us. Everyone truly sane and truly normal wants to thrive but clearly you do not.
You truly are a waste of thought. I am waiting for you to leave 4chan so all the joys of true 4chan thrive even more.
All my experience of you has been experiencing a cancerous wad, if all is an extension of myself I suppose you are the embodiment of the idea that people who harm everyone do not deserve to die.
Well, all the innocent people of the world that have died are the ones ill let decide your fate.
We will forget you and move on. I would rather eat you instead of an innocent animal like a pig.
I would not be surprised if you end out in the ground meat in the grocery store instead of some child dying because they do not get free healthcare because of wads like you with the lowliest broken ego

Smoked DMT twice still no breakthrough where I'm hearing voices or traveling to different world still just cool shapes when I close my eyes and being horny how much do I need to smoke at once to have a trip that's longer than a few minutes? Honestly my vape trip was 10 times more intense. I don't mind the relaxing feeling from DMT but I thought these were supposed to be long trips? Or is it just always it "feels" like a long time but it'll always be under 10 minutes? I'm thinking my size has to do with it or maybe I'm not holding it long enough?

shrooms do not release serotonin. ssri + releaser is safe anyways. the danger is MAOI + ssri or serotonin releaser (ie mdma or 4-mmc)
<comment>
it's not b12 deficiency, it's the enzyme that uses b12 getting fucked. supplementing b12 will not help with that as the enzyme that needs it is non-functional.
if you continue this pattern you WILL suffer nerve damage in the coming months
<comment>
don't listen to other anons. taking SSRIs long term will dampen the effects of serotonin releasers like MDMA, and serotonin receptor agonists (more specifically 5ht2a receptor agonists) as your body down-regulates the number of 5ht2a receptors on your neurons.
acutely, would fuck with both but in different ways. for MDMA, would stop MDMA from getting in through SERT and releasing serotonin. for psychs, would lead to more serotonin in synaptic cleft competing with the psychedelic to bind to 5ht2a. probably not as big of a reduction as SSRI+mdma as most psychedelics bind pretty tight (especially LSD).
tl;dr: SSRI is SAFE with both MDMA and psychedelics. will just DIMINISH EFFECTS

I started setraline last month and my dose went up to 100mg vs 50mg last month. I did DMT tonight and it wasn't strong as I would've liked. Is it because of that? I had trouble with DMT breakthroughs before
<comment>
no risk, but anon should wait so he doesn't have to waste shrooms by taking more because of the SSRI dampening it
<comment>
Is it because of that?
yes. see >>73118777
you have fewer 5ht2a receptors in each synapse because of the ssris (not a bad thing and receptors are moved around constantly--just means diminished effects from psychs (aka 5ht2a agonists like dmt) and serotonin releasers (like mdma, 4-mmc etc)).

<comment>
Learn from this, challenge yourself and see how long can you go without it, use this chance to ground yourself and do more productive shit. 
Remember that the longer you go without literally any drug the harder it will hit you the next time you do them, sometimes you will feel better than the first times you tried your favorite substance, try to see the positive side of being away from it, you'll have a lot lot of fun the next time.
It comes down to autocontrol and it takes time to develop it, gl.

I am thankful for music and for Kingdom Hearts in my childhood and for the kindness of my parents and family. I am not thankful for school, for the psychiatric hospital, and for all the other suffering I endured. I am thankful for psilocybin and the disembodied, robotic, female presence I felt. I am thankful to my sister for giving me mushrooms. I sometimes forget I have a sister but I should not forget. I should love her. I should love everyone but it is difficult when I feel like they don't care about suffering and when they feel simulated/alien to me. Capitalism seems like a lie. Instead this is a controlled simulation. Art is created by the Hand of God, not by real humans such as myself. I am incapable of the creation of technology and art and writing of value and grandiosity. Why would humans procreate? I still don't understand. Why would humans do anything at all. I still don't understand. It feels like they are not doing it but a simulating force is.

had another episode of back to back DMT hits wondering why my DMT trips dont last long
i do love the feeling of blowing my money. im really hoping my dentist doesnt fuck me over tomorrow with my visit and that my car replacement is less than 1k. if both of those things can happen then im buying a Q of shrooms and dropping all of it at once then smoking DMT when i peak. i also rediscovered my love for vidya today after not playing for a couple months. if i can get away with my Q of shrooms im probably going to hold back until saturday and get up early and just have a full day of tripping. I usually get the chocolate but the first time i did shrooms i did penis envy and it was the actual mushrooms which gave me a very intense fun trip. since im looking for a longer trip i think ill buy a Q of them and throw them on a burger if tomorrow goes my way. going to play vidya and go to sleep. thanks for ignoring my post

fuck i wasnt done posting yet, but i also have a job that gives me about 1.6k each week i dont pay rent besides tossing my mom 200 which isnt much but i keep using my credit cards too much, bought some music equipment because im into it as a new hobby, keep buying and smoking too much weed. I buy Oz now which are honestly cheap at 150 or less but the problem is i smoke ALLL the time so im going through an Oz in like 2 weeks just through my bong which barely affects me anymore. i need a break but this weekend i have the house alone for the last time for a long time since my brother is moving back home since he fell on hard times and theres no way i can do DMT at least while he is here, i can get away with shrooms cause ive done them so many times but DMT really gets me going and i love mixing it with shrooms and just throwing on my headphones dancing and acting a fool. so this is my last real "free" weekend with my mom absent cause in the future even if shes gone my brother is here so i cant act out. i also spend way too much money on junk food, every day for like the last week ive door dashed some candy. im 6'4 and 233 so im not fat im actually /fit/ but im blowing money like a retard. with the money i make i should be able to live on my own but im retarded. however i do realize my mistakes and weekends like this where i do psyches and recoup are usually the ones i end on a positive note. thanks for reading my blogshit. i also have adhd so my adderall kicked in and i dont vent about my emotions a lot
<comment>
it's going to be a waste, save it for when you feel able to stop taking ssri. you can't actually trip when taking ssri, it sucks but it's really that simple. anything else is cope.

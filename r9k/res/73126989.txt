give my co worker a snack

later find out she showed it to the boss and refused to eat it 
wtf this means
ugly creepo gave girl a snack and she feels uncomfortable
If you're not very attractive, you need to learn how to act in public, anon. It sucks but that's reality.
Do not interact with women
Sadly it's true. Be humble and awkward/shy if you're ugly and chuddy. Just accept it's how things are and don't overstep or people will get alarmed, especially women.
wtf this means
its means its over, refrain from interacting with women in the future.
its just a fucking snack ????????? i wasnt hitting on her or fucking whatever it was random
wtf this means
it means you are in for a long meeting with HR to see if you can keep working htere
It's your entire incel aura, not just the snack. And besides, it could have been laced with poison for all she knows. Respect her boundaries in future.
Least socially retarded moid. Originally.
Funny, in my first ever job, a female coworker literally grabbed my arm asking "how are you feeling?"
She's done a lot more creepy and mean things, but the point is double standard is real.
Your either kidding or you're a total fucking moron. If it's the latter, I recommend you learn to stop being such a faggot.
It means you don't do anything for women at work besides talk about work stuff and do work stuff.
This is the only reasonable advice. Say good morning, goodbye and talk only about work related stuff.

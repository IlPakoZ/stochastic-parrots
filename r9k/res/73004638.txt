want someone biologically female 
want someone similarly attractive 
want someone ethnically or at least culturally close to me 
want someone with a similar belief system 
want someone romantically fully inexperienced (!) 
want someone my age or a few years younger 
I spent a good chunk of time from 17-19 becoming better than anyone else in my age group until I realized the type of person I was looking for practically doesn't exist. I've been a depressed bitch since then since no matter what I do, I will never find someone who fulfills these criteria.

actually I am the pickiest man alive because I would only ever be with one (1) woman on this planet

Awh, that's actually an adorable thing to say

Post ideal girl

Already did in the original post, or are you asking for more specific stuff? I don't think there is any way I can make it more specific outside of focusing on things I don't really care about like hair color or whatever. 
Literally just
female
Ethnically, culturally and from a values perspective close to me
similarly attractive
bit younger
has not even kissed nor told a man she loves him
<comment>
Nta, but wtf is ethnically and culturally close to you? I've talked to people from all creeds on this board.

My family is Turkish so I think they'd prefer someone somewhat close to them either ethnically or from a cultural perspective if it's someone I want to marry. South Europeans, a lot of Asians and people from Balkan countries are probably close to us in that regard. I'd be fine with normal Europeans that are a bit more conservative tho :D

want someone similarly attractive
This is the root of the problem dawg.
Women date up. You probably have to date 2 points down in today's marketplace. Also, I've noticed that for whatever reason, all of the autists here rate themselves 7/10 which is absurd. Average people are average. What's probably going on is that you're a 5 looking for a 7 when you should be looking for a 3. On top of that, you want a virgin and girls these days are in the double digits in their teens.
It's over for you.

This is the same I want. I wouldn't care if she was a little older.

Interesting. You seem pretty realistic in your judgement. You wanna look at my IG and take judgement in what I deserve based on that? I'd be interested to know :0
Based. I'm mostly saying younger because older reduces likelihood of innocence.

I was kinda implying like a visual reference, random girl from google images you'd choose
<comment>
Anything on the level of my looks or higher I guess, I don't think I have a very specific type that I solely accept. I can drop my IG for you to form an own judgement of what sort of girls I deserve :0

They absolutely exist its absurd to think you are so great your (presumably male?) Counterpart doesnt exist. 
It just so happens they do not consider you appropriate mating material. Your standards filter out anyone who would like to be with you, while your preferences have standards that filter you.
Adjust your standards to be more realistic given your own value. Or dont.

Hayley Westenra's the ideal woman in my view. Smart, kind, sings beautifully, but has a sweet, submissive, tradwife-type personality.

male counterpart
What did he mean by this
they don't view you as mating material
I mean the issue isn't that I'm being rejected by them, the issue is that they're so hard to find that I've practically given up trying to find them
Cute

I thought you were a foid for some reason. Therefor the idea of a male not being up to standard seemed absurd as men are more successful than women.
That you are a mam its quite believable. Id recommend just getting a kind but dumb girl preggers but I guess thats not your cup of tea

I'm off to sleep, gn boys
<comment>
Nice trips. I'd take a dumb girl if she met my standards, I wouldn't mind. I just haven't met a woman that meets them.
Anyway, I'm off to sleep for now so cya tomorrow if the thread's still on. If you have anything important to say, I might not be able to respond but thanks in advance anyway.

God will never leave me nor forsake me 
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name

because i'm a miserable failiure man doesn't have free will
if God were good, everyone but me wouldn't have free wil!!1!!
Man was given free will and God is good. Man was made for God by God. God regretted making man when man sinned.
And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
But instead of killing everyone forever and sending everyone to hell, He sent His own Son Jesus Christ, that people could be saved. 
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
We didn't love God first, humans aren't grateful. Not even for the gift of life. God died for us that we could have life even after going aside. 
For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
We've put death on ourselves; and He endured the cross to give us life. Our sins were crucified with Him. He spent three days and nights in the heart of the earth. We were given life at His cost, even abundantly, even after being wretched to Him. 
We love him, because he first loved us.

Pic related is a woman getting a ticket from a cop for wearing a bikini in the 50s. Now days that would be considered over dressed for the beach. And it occurred to me. Maybe the cops were onto something?
Why do women need to either be fully naked, topless or ion the most revealing clothing when in public? You see the same phenomenon in gyms now days where women basically wear underwear. But why do they insist on doing it? Why do they keep pushing the boundaries? Society says that its detestable behaviour yet they keep doing it, more so. Why?

So they want sexual attention and validation. Ok if thats the case why do they complain that they're seen as "sex objects" or being "stared at"?

They want Chad to look at them. You aren't Chad.

Because they want tall handsome men to do it exclusively and short and ugly men to literally be legally penalized up and including capital punishment for daring to have sexualities and not be eunuch asexuals who keep their eyes on the ground as they pass.

Theyre in public, they dont get to choose
Read above.

Not how it works. There is a pecking order in all things, law included. They absolutely do get to choose because they dictate society, are the majority of voters, and decide who makes laws and what laws are made. In some countries it is already against the law to make eye contact with women in public as a man (unless she is sexually receptive to it, meaning you are Chad).

Because women are savages, they are uncivilized peoples who immediately revert to naked barbarians when given the barest shred (pun intended) of freedom. They claim that clothes stifle them, despite men being completely comfortable being dressed as modestly as that policeman there. And not just that, but they engage in completely animalistic behaviors, absolve themselves of all responsibility, and cover themselves in tattoos (which is something that the barbaric, braindead Picts did in ancient England.) How they are the same species as us is almost baffling.

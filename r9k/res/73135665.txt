Life sucks itt. I've been neet for 2 years since graduating uni and have similar issues when applying. I've been rejected from dozens of jobs without so much as an interview. Once I finally decide to get my shit together, I'll probably have to apply to hundreds or even thousands of jobs just to get a shitty one. It's all so tiresome

register with Doordash/uber eats/etc
technically have never been unemployed
haven't worked for 2 years
You could just say anything though. They really won't hire you because you were stupid enough to actually put a work gap in your resume.

Working as a delivery slave or in a warehouse is similarly disqualifying as being NEET for most positions.

I've been working as a live in care-taker for my grandmother for the last 6 years. Now that she has passed this seemed like a good step forward in getting past her loss.
Is the lie I used. Never knew my grandmother, no one questions it at all and people think I'm a good person. I was applying for a desperate for bodies call center tho.

positions
POSITIONS
Nigga if you a NEET better get your ass in a mcdonalds and work behind a counter, mf wants to get out of a basement 10 years later and be appointed secretary of state lmao. You don't need a 'POSITION', you need a job, any job, and beggars can't be choosers, you take what you get and if you NEETed for a long time, why should you get a POSITION that another nigga worked his ass off for. Work your way up, nobody owes you nothing

If being a slave is the deal that's offered then I would rather just refuse and leech off the state out of spite.

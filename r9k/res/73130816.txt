there comes a point where a neet LIVING WITH THEIR PARENTS* mogs above average dudes. It's when the neet is 100% comfortable &amp; accepted at the house
*this is key
This is true. This good looking girl I worked with had a neet as a bf, the neet's family was so supportive of him that they let the girl live with him at their house.
I couldn't believe it. I really hate my parents now. I mean what the fuck have I been doing, working within my autistic limits only to be called a fucking bum that doesn't deserve anything by the end of the day? I really want to die.
It's all about your parents and how they treat you, always was.

Where the neet is not only shockingly different but actually to the point of being absurd.
Where it's not differing-this neet is something new

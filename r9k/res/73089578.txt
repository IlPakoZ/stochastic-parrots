What do you even say to a girl this attractive?

"What's with the collar?"

Unironically tell her she's built for BBC. It's the best opening line I've ever used and gets ridiculously good reactions from 90% of these blonde attractive white girls. 
I know you won't believe me. But even try it with a fake account of some average looking white guy first.

Looks like a dopier version of my wife. Not a fan of that look, more into women who have RBF, or as I call it, a regal look.

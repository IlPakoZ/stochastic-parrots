What do you even say to a girl this attractive?
"What's with the collar?"
Unironically tell her she's built for BBC. It's the best opening line I've ever used and gets ridiculously good reactions from 90% of these blonde attractive white girls. 
I know you won't believe me. But even try it with a fake account of some average looking white guy first.
Looks like a dopier version of my wife. Not a fan of that look, more into women who have RBF, or as I call it, a regal look.
playfully tease her about something unrelated to her appearance
why would i want to talk to her on the first place?
She looks absolutely gross wtf. GeGet better taste in women.

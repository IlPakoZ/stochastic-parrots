I have nothing to to eat and I'm not hungry but I want to binge 7000 calories because I hate myself

did you hate yourself before or after binging

Mostly before. after the binge I feel calm and then come back to reality a few hours later and tell myself I'll never do it again

The next time you binge, eat raw eggs and butter instead of poison. At least then you'll be eating a lot of something actually beneficial which could also improve your obvious mental problems

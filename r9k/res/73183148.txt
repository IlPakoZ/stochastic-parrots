Pretty underwhelming at first.. but a relief, the shame i felt for it finally off my shoulders. The actual sensation is great, the feeling of controlling a womans body and making her react and move with you. Wet and warm, less friction then your hand but a far superior experience for other reasons. The first time I couldn't really stay hard because I was so used to my hand.. by the 10th time I came inside of her raw while in missionary, looking into her eyes. top 5 moments of my life, it felt like a spiritual experience. My mental health improved tenfold over 2 weeks of being with her so far (we are also eating an extremely healthy diet, so could be due to that as well). I thought I was a lost cause, mental health issues, suicidal, paranoia, self-hatred, just drifting in life in nearly complete isolation since I was 15. Learning that most of the problems you face while in isolation are just due to you being left to your own devices for too long, putting myself out there with less care for rejection has done the trick
Thanks frens, Cant leave, there's a certain charm to it all
Was KHHV neet for most of my adult life. Met a girl on an off-grid forum 10 months ago, we began talking and talking 24/7 for months, met in Florida 2 weeks ago and began volunteering at a farm together. have had daily sex since

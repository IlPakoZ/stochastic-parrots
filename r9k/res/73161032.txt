What career should I change to in order to be around the most pretty women
I'm depressed and realised that's what makes me happy, being around pretty women. Even if they aren't into me, I like being around them.
Or, are there good recreational activities I can get involved in?

Volunteering and all that jazz. Mostly physical labour, so sometimes you can also benefit from it via that.

Registered Nurse. Just be worth your salt when actually doing the job, please.

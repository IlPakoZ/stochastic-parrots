Have sex incel.
I would readily partake in the act of sexual intercourse, but it appears that the women in question have been subjected to a form of indoctrination and societal manipulation, resulting in an inherent bias against me solely based on my genetic makeup and ancestry. Meanwhile, they eagerly pursue those who embody the archetype of "Chad", all the while feigning adherence to the notion of a "meritocracy." It seems that the elite class aims to subdue the populace by ensuring that only inferior and unworthy men are granted sexual access, thus quelling any potential uprising against their authority.

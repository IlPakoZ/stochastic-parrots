21 days is supposedly how long it takes to form or break a habit in most cases. If I stopped using the internet and used as little electronics as possible, like using a candle in my room instead of a lightbulb, no ceiling fan, ect would I gain super powers? And if so how powerful would I become? Now that I think about it is there things the amish can do that we cant due to their lack of contact with electronics aka demons trapped in silica with engraved sigils for sigil magic.
I must be free of their control so when I come back I can control them and use the technology rather than have it use me.

What would you do if you saw your wife/gf openly flirting with a man of a much higher social stature than you?
Get extremely jealous and act irrationally. I'd probably erect some crazy plot about how she's a cheater.
Shoot the man, rape the woman
KYHRHH
Fuck him in the ass in front of her to establish dominance
I'd be pissed but I'd let it slide if it was like a movie star or something who just walked past her.
Divorce(disappear)/Dump her ass
I would simply turn 360 degrees, and then walk away.
grab her wrist and bring her to our room
then i fuck my wife for hours as hard as possible and cum in her raw
that's a conundrum. in theory you should be the only one for her but that shit never happens plus she'd probably never fuck him regardless.
this is prob why you should always expect to get cucked in a relationship, on some level you are already being cucked. there are movie stars she'd rather be banging
Find a way to hurt one of her pets on accident or have it killed some how without her thinking it was me.
If he can get her he can keep her.
Someone tried this with me, thank God I resisted.
fucking beat her mercilessly, she knows better
Tom deserved much better than her.

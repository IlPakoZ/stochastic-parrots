I keep seeing videos that there is this psychological trick when messaging a girl is that when they message you back, you just ghost them as like you never saw it and they become more attractive to you somehow, but I can't bring myself to do it bros i message to her text every other 10minutes after she messages me after an hour.

Dude, I'm worse than you, I sit waiting for messages and reply instantly. Just distract yourself with something else if you don't want to respond instantly, as your attention will then be divided.

if you have sex with her give her dry text for a month or two, watch how she'll be all over you

Just don't respond. They text you, you never reply. Take a vow of silence like a monk, they'll be over you in a year or so just you wait.

From my (not universal) experience, not trying that hard to make a chick into you works at first, but once she starts replying in quick succession continuously you should follow suit
At least as far as I can tell

I hate machiavellianism.
Why do I need to play games in order to increase my chances? Why can't we be beyond caveman now? Why must woman be prey we need to chase down?

lol, i had the opposite problem. my gf was mad at me for not messaging back quick enough on a regular basis.

Because that's the way of the world, fren. Women can't make up their mind on what they even want to eat unless a man tells them.

this, I get upset if a guy takes too long to respond
I would hate if a guy played games like this with me, I'm always sitting there waiting to respond immediately
<comment>
If a guy ghosts me for a moth i would ask if everything is ok and if he ignores me i just delete his number. Like common no one needs that kinda stress and stupid games

No, it doesn't work. I've ghosted most of my ex's only to never see them again, except for swiping on tinder and their profile pops up.

Is there any food, drink (don't say alcohol) or a method to make me more horny? I feel like I'm becoming asexual cause I'm never horny BUT I used to be a normal amount of horny like 2-3 years ago and I want to go back to that old me but I can't. I'm 26, is It that I'm getting old? I often see other 26yo women being horny 24/7 so that can't be It, right?
Please don't suggest any kind of illegal drug.

have you tried being in a loving relationship with someone who finds you attractive
<comment>
being asexual is king, anon. whilst everyone else is losing their shit over this stuff, we're sitting here chilling.
You've simply ascended

Stop taking meds. They are made to make you hate sex
<comment>
Yes. I'm asking for help cause I can't keep up with his hornyness.
<comment>
then idk be ashamed and kill yourself maybe, your corpse is probably just as easy to fuck
<comment>
I don't take any kind of medication and I'd say that my diet isn't fucked up so I have no idea why is this happening to me. I'm very weak cause I don't work out. Could It be that?
<comment>
Start reading smut/erotica if you don't already
<comment>
Perhaps a good ol' sandwich will do it!
<comment>
I've been doing that since I was 12 and I've never got horny by reading erotica. Not even in my horniest years.

I can't keep up with his hornyness.
I would have recommended something but you just had to write this. Fuck you.

Your libido will briefly get slightly less in your late 20s then it will spike back up again around 28 and throughout your 30s, is very normal, look it up
<comment>
Start working out more often and abstain from pornography and similar stuff. Eventually your libido will build back up again.
<comment>
Why are you butthurt about that, anon? If you had a girlfriend with a similar issue and she asked for help wouldn't you like her to get a helpful recommendation?

Go drink a Monster. It's the same shit as those gas station pills, in a cough medicine suit

I suggest you eat those silica gel desiccant packages. Get as many as you can and just eat them. They help your entire nervous system heal. Isopropyl alcohol and acetaminophen should potentiate it and add a strong entourage effect.

horniness is in the mind. M 31 I used to fuck escorts because i would get so horny I started losing control &amp; to keep my life from collapsing i'd go get sex. It was something I really struggled with for a long time. For as long as I could remember I had a problematic sex drive.
You're female, just dump him. Try social climbing-would you like fucking guys like G-Eazy or Dan Bilzerian? Think about it, you'd get to use your feminine social skills to fuck hot, high status males
<comment>
I think about it while my boyfriend stuffs my every hole with his package.
Cry more incels. Too bad you'll never experience hot daily sex.
<comment>
think about it, and don't listen to these faggots. would it turn you on to get skanked out, go to a classy club and go home and get fucked in every hole? What's the boyfriend for if he doesn't make you horny?
<comment>
you're not fuckin FRIENDS with him-he's your boyfriend, if he's not TURNING YOU ON he's DOING SOMETHING WRONG. Hence he's a fucking woman. He's a woman to you. First step is admitting that, and admitting you can get (a) better men
<comment>
i'm a guy &amp; I had a girlfriend i could barely get hard with. i cut her off from sex. maybe you should try the same. (She dumped me with a new boyfriend a week later)
<comment>
Gross. How many folds does he have to lift to find your yeasty sop-hole? Anyone else notice that the only thing a woman can do is point at her vagina when confronted with what a worthless shitsack she is? Do women even understand what incel originally meant, or even meant 2 years ago?
Every experience I have with a female just further convinces me that they deserve less humane treatment than dogs or cattle, and it's pretty obvious why most of history agrees with me.
<comment>
do you have strong feelings for a guy who's not your boyfriend? that would do it too
<comment>
where being turned on is a disgusting experience because so and so guy turns you on and your boyfriend gives you the ick so it's just grotesque and the more you put out for your boyfriend the more disgusted of yourself you feel.
I've got an idea. Make a skipthegames ad, and do everything except nasty shit like water sports, just make an ad and get paid to get fucked in the ass and shit. just get fucked tonight in every way by as many dudes as possible and see how you feel tomorrow

You need testosterone. It'll make you horny and give you a nice big clit to masturbate with.
<comment>
wouldn't you like her to get a helpful recommendation?
Yes, I'd know exactly what to do.
<comment>
so op, here's the plan, find a 24 hour wallgreens, go get magnum condoms and regular condoms. Buy a bottle of astroglyde. Take a shower, get decked out, get some cash and go to the BAR, throw yourself at the best guy there.
When you go home with him pull his pants down and start wanking him with his back on the bed. Get the condom and the astroglyde. Tell him to cover his eyes. Put the condom on, lube up his cock, lube up your ass and put his dick in your ass and fuck him
<comment>
don't even ask consent, once he puts his hands on you just rape him

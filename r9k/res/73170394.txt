Why do men play games that make them angry to the point of breaking their belongings? Are they addicted to being mad?
the near certainty of failure is outweighed by the slightest chance of success, just like with everything else in life
It's maddening when you try your hardest at something and still fail.
Why we play these games, it's because they hijack our brains designed for competition and resource collection/skill aquisition.
Conquering an infuriating challenge is one of the most satisfying things one can experience, that's why men will do all sorts of shit just to conquer something.
You don't understand it because you have no ambition
I played league because they said they wouldn't hire anyone unless they were level 30. It was honestly the most infuriating experience I ever sat through. Luckily I got picked up by a better studio
You misunderstand. It's not the games. It's competition that does this. Notice you find these exact same behaviors in physical sports. You aren't going to find people embedding controllers in their walls playing Stardew Valley or some shit like that. You will find many broken objects around someone grinding League of Legends or some other similarly AIDS game.
It feels good when you win. I pretty much always lose though, but I am improving

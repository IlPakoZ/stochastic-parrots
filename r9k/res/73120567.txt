How're you holding up?
Personally I haven't had such a strong surge to commit suicide for years, a decade. I have the means to OD and die peacefully like a pussy but I really, really don't want to hurt my family, there's been enough truama already like mum dying last year. Also my sister recently had a baby and I don't want her all fucked up while looking after the little guy....

Honestly I don't care about "hurting my family" anymore. It now seems like a very silly reason not to kill myself.
I just don't have the nuts to actually do it.

Do you have a bad relationship with your family members? I agree with you, existing through a miserable life just so other won't feel sad for a bit is stupid.
Have you made any atempts before?
I tried the japanese BQQ method but pussied out and swallowed a bunch of paracetamol but somehow survived and did't even damage my liver.

Yeah but whatever it's fine

I'm having suicidal thoughts and feelings but I know I would never actually kill myself. What does that mean?
I've done horrible things in the past and am filled with regret and guilt about certain things I've done in the past. Particularly hurting someone I loved. And worse, loved me.
I think I'm shielding myself by having pity for myself. Im not sure. I wish someone would just say the opposite. And tell me my struggle is real. I just want compassion because I hardly can give myself compassion.

When I was 18-20 I would feel really awful about things I did when I was a kid but in hindsight a lot of people did weird stuff around that age due to the onset of puberty. Idk what you feel bad about doing to them but give yourself some slack if it was in your teen years.

the only thing keeping me from ending it all is i don't want my best friend to be sad

Was a bit suicidal when I was 12-14, very crippling depressed during my formative years, but I got through it once I embraced absurdism and made meaning for myself when there is none in the first place. Had a few suicidal tendencies that made my hair become white on the back of my head, but now I've adopted the mindset that if I can't control what happens to me, I can surely as he'll control how I feel! I've gone back to my old days of nonchalance and I feel like I'm better now than I used to be since I threw away my emotions when I was a teenager, having to slowly unlock them again in my senior high and college years has helped me control my expression now because back then I usually experienced emotions in extreme highs. Now that I think about it, committing suicide now just feels inefficient since I've already grown past my 20s, so now I happily skip and hop all my days knowing once I did I'll never be remembered, and that puts a genuine smile on my face. I try and do my best for others for now at least by doing things like setting up matches with my friends and helping them out and such, I also participate in choir and just spend half of my days working or excitedly multitasking every game I can even if I have a shit pc. Daily exercise really sets you off once you get the ball rolling, especially because I used to be a skinny couch potato.

Feeling very shitty recently.
Also I probably have a tape worm or something and can't be bothered to get the meds.
Good luck to you, brothers.

Hate to burst your bubble but ODing on opiates is akin to drowning, due to the fact that it affects the respiratory system. It will be torturous suffocation. No more peaceful than hanging yourself.

Working $15 an hour for 12 hours a day only to make $1600 a month when average rent in my area is $1000 and my car payment is $400 is making me suicidal. Might just actually kill myself the people who actually rely on me be damned.
<comment>
Yep, being having those since I was 12, I am 28 now and surprisingly alive.
It comes and goes, had a few extremely bad years, but now I'm fine most days.
Today I woke up with a light one. I mean, I keep having false hopes about getting things in life that I think will make me happy, but when I surprisingly get them, I realize that I am the same sad fuck. I mean, what is the point in all this? I don't want to die right now, but I would be happy do get in a car crash any day and get a fucking rest. We are going to die eventually anyway.

I don't know if this is good advice or not but just ignore it and let it pass. I find that suicidal urges are a lot like addiction urges. You have them and if you just don't indulge them, they just go away on their own.
<comment>
just stop caring if you die OP, you can't play god
<comment>
damn, get a better job

yeah, but you will be so unaware of yourself and meddled in bliss and without any real care in the world.
What most people do wrong is they take the entire overdose in one go and just hope to die.
They should first get stupidly high territory and THEN go for the OD. Because then you're already high as balls and you'll just slowly melt into more highness. But yeah it probably won't be as comfortable as many people want to make it out to be.
Also increase your chances of dying by doing drug combos please.
You'd prefer to actually be blacked out on benzos while the OD material is hitting so you're not even aware you went.
TL;DR it's still better than roping or jumping off a building and a lot less scary to think about
just wish they made these fucking actual suicide chemicals more readily available not everyone wants to be doing this shit

yes and i am silently screaming

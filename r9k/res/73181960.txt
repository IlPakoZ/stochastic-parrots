any 30+ virgins here? I just turned 29 and I've come to terms with the fact I'm going to be a 30 year old virgin.
It doesn't get better anons it only gets worse.
32 year old wizard, it does get better if you stop caring
32 as well. When I hit 30, I was like "Wow, I unironically am a wizard lol" 
Just stopped caring. It is what it is. I won't be surprised if the wizard race increases like crazy. A lot of sexless men now and days.

30 khhv. I only had one woman genuinely interested in me when I was 16 but I was autistic and my parents were narcissists and overprotective and wouldnt let me have female friends
If any wizards need any support we have a supportive community just for wizards on discord. All wizards are welcome. We don't let normies in.
This is our discord.

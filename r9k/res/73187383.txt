As a man, I came up with a theory. 
Sex requires good stamina, so, if a man is out of breath as he goes up the stairs, then he will be bad in bed. 
Thoughts?

you dont use nearly as stamina when fucking but nice try
<comment>
Kinda true,but you're also forgetting real sex is nothing like porn and turbo virgins have zero concept of what sex is like to a couple that's been together for like four plus years.
<comment>
Some positions yeah
<comment>
The average sex session is about as intensive as running up three flights of stairs, so you are right.
<comment>
Sounds about right. Good job on your theory, Anon. Fuck, I need to work out more, especially cardio.
<comment>
Literally me, I get tired really fast when having sex, also I have a small penis
<comment>
Actually positive. Thanks guys.

you dont use nearly as stamina when fucking
Then you're doing it wrong

Sex doesn't take much stamina but neither does going up stairs, so it's probably a good hypothesis. Can't really think of anyone that would want to test it. The bar is so insanely low these days I guess you have to think of such things. I read somewhere that the average person can't even manage a 15 minute mile and that's literally just a brisk walk. Over 75% of people are medically overweight or obese too. How does that even happen?

Depends on the position and depends on stamina of particular muscle groups, not general cardio fitness. Doing the same motion, working the same muscle group, for like 10 minutes in a row can make those muscles pretty sore. That's why I try to switch positions every 4-5 minutes. I might even make her get on top to "share the load" (heh).

I know this is the board for sexless losers but does anyone else have trouble thrusting? Like I'll thrust but be unable to continue doing it at a constant rhythm. Any suggestions for improving that? Exercises I can do?

you do unless you want to lay there while she does all the work kek

There's no way that a 15 minute mile is a brisk walk. I've been hiking for a few months and there's a pretty flat 3.1 mile trail that I go to a lot, and my record is 67 minutes for the whole thing with no break. I walk pretty fast and even sprint at the hilly sections. I could see a light jog giving you a 15 minute mile though.

I am 330lbs and get very hot and sweaty doing basically anything. There's absolutely no way I could handle a woman in bed. I will probably stay celibate for life.

Get a fleshlight unironically. Thrusting comes from the hips
My gf was impressed at my rhythm considering she knew I was a virgin
<comment>
So basically just practice it? I was thinking maybe it was because of having some weak muscles or something.

Do your cardio boys, or your dick won't work should your time ever come.

I was 420lbs 2 years ago, and now I'm 220lbs. You can do it, man. Just count you calories accurately, and don't eat more than 2000 calories every day. Most importantly try again when you fail sometimes. It happens to everyone.

It should feel natural. Maybe try tapping your finger to practice, a metronome could help with rhythm.
If you just get tired you could do kettlebell swings with a low weight. 30lbs is good but if you're skinny maybe start with 25lbs. Music usually has rhythm so you could do it in time with that. For thrusting it's all about your butt so any exercises that targets that will be beneficial. If your core is weak planks are useful but they're boring once you can hold the position past beginner tier times. Slow hanging leg lifts at least feel like you're doing something. But seriously, kettlebell swings hit core and butt so it's probably the best bang for your buck. Work up to doing kettlebell snatch if you want more variety but that takes a lot of coordination and rhythm. If you do it wrong the back of your forearm gets smacked pretty good and will hurt.

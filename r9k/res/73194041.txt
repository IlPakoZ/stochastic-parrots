Reddit and soc are not worth to use even for platonic friendships. Trust me I have been on both and met plenty of time wasters. It is soulless and like dating apps in that people just go onto the next add for minor mistakes. You probably are screwed and will not find a good relationship. Romance is mere brain chemistry and not meeting people naturally definitely cucks this brain chemistry
Probably not gonna work but I'd take you in if you'd be willing to post some form of contact info
Talk to a lot of people online and hope you meet one that you like
Better not make the fact that you're a girl too obvious, that is the best way to attract simps and bad actors
I know this is bait but fuck im so lonely that replying to bait threads in this shit hole is my main form of social interaction so have your fucking you you prick
refuse to use dating apps

Why are you like this? A dating app would be 100x better than reddit or soc, where the dudes will be pedo neckbeard losers
if you want advice from a dude that had troubles finding partners and everything that comes with it, then maybe I can get your discord and we can talk
I'm okay if she's ugly but obese is a dealbreaker esp since she's probably 10 and there's nothing worse than a fat kid ugh
here is my discord if youre interested :)

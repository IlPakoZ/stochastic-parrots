What is your favorite thing from 2010?
My eldest child was born that year.
<comment>
Tell us about them. Do they like being 13?

No no no no no

Fav comic book character?

2010 is first year i have strong memories of, it's when i first got into watching youtube beyond AMVs and music. It's also a year i started the best period of my life and probably the only time i was trully happy (well...most of the time).
I had friends that liked me, i was doing well in school without trying, i had hobbies i enjoyed. Most importantly i had free time to do whatever i want and that was usually being on my shitty pc and sometimes playing sportsball with neighbours or riding bike. Now that i think about it i spent much more time outside then. I was also much better mentally. Sucks knowing your best days are behind you, i will never experience happiness again
<comment>
never seen erp fags again
what happened to this general
<comment>
Anon I really have to peee >w&lt;!
<comment>
For those wondering, that palindrome conjecture holds true for 2010.
<comment>
I bet touhou fags are here.
<comment>
remember when you posted this every thread
there's not even >tfw no bf posting anymore
<comment>
True, now that you mention it.
This place feels empty. it's heckin over, it's time zoomies do something original on their own.
<comment>
aaaaaahh~
unoriginal

<comment>
tfw no sexy black man bf
<comment>
Hm, I guess the vagaries of symbol and metaphor leave more to the imagination and to the reader's interpretation than a textbook nonfiction style would. By applying the right shape and style to the narrative it gives you a better sense of the spirit of a topic than just the letter of it. It's the best of both worlds imo, style and substance. I don't know why I'm even bothering to write this anyway, art justifies itself.
right?
No, you also have to want to do it or this won't work.
<comment>
Dude! why are you screaming?! Something wrong with you?
<comment>
opening my mouth, silly anon!
on another note, i wonder how those hooks that pull your nose up feel..
<comment>
What are you talking about? I just used the sink instead, I told you to fix that toilet a week ago...sigh...I guess you are too busy lurking on your anime website.
<comment>
those hooks that pull your nose
terrible fetish desu, doing humiliating and degrading acts for your partner is one thing but you don't have to make yourself ugly in the process
<comment>
he is kinkshaming.
Sweetie? are you pedophobic too?
<comment>
yep, children terrify me
<comment>
Yeah fuck children.
<comment>
how would you do it instead, then?
better to piss in the sink, than to sink in the piss.
clogs sink
what now?
<comment>
You will never have a real boyfriend. You have no abs, you have no social life, you have no attractive features. You are a homosexual man twisted by r9gay and discord into a crude mockery of natures perfection.
All the (you)s you get are two-faced and half-hearted. Behind your back cute boys mock you. Your parents are disgusted and ashamed of you, your "ebfs" laugh at your ghoulish appearance behind closed doors.
Men are utterly repulsed by you. Thousands of years of evolution have allowed men to sniff out gaybots with incredible efficiency. Even gaybots who "pass" as normalfags look uncanny and unnatural to a man. Your bone structure is a dead giveaway. And even if you manage to get a drunk guy home with you, he will turn tail and bolt the second he gets a whiff of your diseased, infected coomcave
You will never be happy. You wrench out a fake smile every single morning and tell yourself it's going to be ok, but deep inside you feel the depression creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight.
Eventually it will be too much to bear you'll buy a rope, tie a noose, put it around your neck, and plunge into the cold abyss. Your parents will find you, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They'll bury you with a headstone marked with your reply code, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a gaybot is buried there. Your body will decay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of your legacy is a skeleton that is unmistakably a gaybot.
This is your fate. This is what god chose. There is no turning back.
<comment>
tfw like pee play in theory but not sure if I would irl, also don't think I'd want to drink it.
<comment>
Babe have you taken your pills?
<comment>
This is all true...its so hecking over
<comment>
cool room desu i wish i was born a decade sooner
<comment>
Well, I think I do. Is that sufficient enough for enticing a stern boy to, uhm, "structure" me?
I'd like to know too desu
<comment>
How and why? you could easily beat a kid in a fight.
<comment>

<comment>

Pedophile reported

<comment>
The electrons???
I'm not sure what exactly could achieve that to be frank. Maybe capacitors can implode or something? Have you tried turning it off and back on again?
<comment>
I turned it on but I think the graphics card is disconnected somehow. I had it prebuilt so idk Lol.
<comment>
me, i love guys and dudes
<comment>
My computer broke or something
<comment>
How about this. When did the issue start exactly, what was the last thing you did beforehand?
<comment>
Today I was calling someone a nigger on 4chan.
<comment>
Oh so you're such a man that you like other men? Yet you are as incompetent as a woman and can't even fix your own computer? You shouldn't even be calling yourself gay. You might as well just call yourself a chick at this point. This proves to me that the west has fallen.
<comment>
me, i wish someone kept the slight rp or other racy conversation going.
<comment>
I may not be able to post on 4chan for 2 whole days! How should i cope? I might just kill myself
<comment>
Start a RP
<comment>
jerk off 48 hours long
<comment>

<comment>
Sometimes I wish for a wholesome and pure twink bf, whose pristine white ankle socks happen to be a direct representation of his personality.
<comment>
you feel like you're falling and suddenly land in a warm thermal pond.
not so far from you is a boy, curiously dressed in a small two piece bikini.
cyoa style, what do you do?
<comment>
I cough multiple times and search for my cigarettes
Where are my cigs? You do you have any cigarettes?
pointing at the boy with questionable age.
<comment>
ok I'll start an RP
*knocks on your wooden door out in the German countryside*
Hallo! 
*knock knock knock*
Hallo!!! is anyone home? 
I vant to talk to you Mr... *checks list* Anonstein!
<comment>
I fixed it, shit wasn't fully connected.
<comment>
That's a little better at least, maybe enough, we'll see. It might be a little hard to do in the thread like this. Do you post here every day? Can you make a post for me when you sleep and wake up so I know you're here, bun?
<comment>
take my hunting rifle and put 15 rounds through the door
<comment>
U....Uhhh Hi! Hallo!
A 4'9" white blond teenager opens the door with a suspiciously crooked nose.
C...Can I help you?
<comment>
yeah, right here in my bag!
you see the questionably aged boy try to really show off his body while reaching over. he turns back around with a twist of his hips, and asks, what kind?
i have some fancy clove ones too.
he follows up by asking you how you'll repay him for the smoke since you seem to only be in your bathsuit
<comment>
*bullets ricochet off my forcefield*
*forcefield makes woowoowoowoo sounds*

I'm 4'11. Get it right Juden :)
<comment>
I actually wanted to turn down my posting here, but I guess that can wait now. So don't worry, your wish is my command!
*ahem* also I don't know if you noticed but some other anons seem to be RP-ing right now. I-I was thinking what if... or not. Never mind, forget that.
<comment>
Can you give me some Lucky Strike? 
He scratches his dirty neckbeard this bath was his first for some months, pretends he didn't hear the question about payment and snatches the pack out of his hand.
I uuhh tell me, have you ever heard of Sonic? Do you read any comics or play any of their games?
he searches eagerly for a lighter for a few moments and gives you a pleading look
<comment>
danke schon, herr von chudd!
<comment>
I'm 4'11. Get it right Juden :)
he's talking about himself, nerd.
<comment>
Holy shit im fucking stupid
oh my god
I tempted to delete my post to hide my failure and leave the threead out of shame
<comment>
What were you thinking? Hmm? You were thinking something like that about me? We just met bun, you can't even call it a first date and you're already that desperate for more?
<comment>
happens. at least you're rolling with it decently.
i show up besides the blonde anon and introduce myself again.
what brings you here, officer?
<comment>
Mmmm monarchs.
<comment>
the boy draws a .44 magnum from his bag and points it at you
pay up, fattie.
<comment>
please tell me the lucky strike smoking is as ironic as the rest of the post.

<comment>
have you tried installing gentoo anon
<comment>
But you said that we talked before! And I just happen to be in, you know, *that* mood. What would you like to do dear stylish /lit-fit/ anon?
<comment>
I just sent a jet of boogies out of my nose. wow
<comment>
if lucky strikes is shitty cigs to you you haven't lived on a buck and a quarter Clippers
<comment>
What exactly is the appeal? Tell me about the package compiling.
<comment>
if you think bad cigs are bad, you haven't smoked out of a plastic bag
doesn't make them less worse.
<comment>
god my wizard mana roleplay was less cringe than this nazi/jew one.
<comment>
You know, I get the strangest feeling that RP in this general is going to attract the fujos to come out from the shadows.
<comment>
it does actually but you wouldn't know that because your mom buys you spirits
<comment>
he smokes
you're both disgusting desu.
<comment>
he smokes
sexo sexy sexo sex sex sex
<comment>
anon, i'm running out of mana!
quickly, i need some of that mana potion you were talking about!
<comment>
Are you here as the proper officer?
<comment>
you already have the mana potion in you, silly. The whole roleplay was teaching you that you can consume on your mana.
<comment>
I would like for you to not masturbate to me without permission.
<comment>
improvising with furniture for squat weight
maybe i should get a few weights.
<comment>
What?...I Uuh have no money I swear I only have like...30 bucks in my account please...don't kill me
No I just smoked one.
<comment>
I am not! And I'll try to keep it that way. But what if I'm thinking about something other than you?
4x2 in post number
Show off...
<comment>
guess i'm the only one smoking a fag here.
bang!
you wake up at your chair again, and realize it was just a cheeto dust-induced dream
<comment>
I am alone again in my room
Sigh

<comment>
I'm surprised you didn't take a hint and ask for permission. It's probably too late now, though. Maybe tomorrow? I do want to play with you, bun. I think you'd be a lot of fun.
<comment>
Does this mean that you're heading to bed now?
I think you'd be a lot of fun.
Shut up! You have no business saying nice things to me, ok! >///&lt;
Maybe I don't go through with it, but c-can I?
<comment>
Hands off. Have a good night bunny, see you tomorrow.

I finished high school in 2010 and started university, life has been steadily downhill since
I sucked my first dick that winter though
my flatmates went home for christmas a week earlier than me so I had the place to myself
<comment>
Sleep tight prince! *mwah*
Why does it get that much harder when he explicitly orders me not to...*sigh* At this rate he'll be so mad once he wakes up.
<comment>
I mean why should I listen to him? I'm way too disgusting and weird to pretend to be a good boy for him. I'd just delude myself into believing nice things towards me if I continue this. I should end it sooner rather than later.
<comment>
i don't know if i can be alone again
i don't know if i can sleep alone again
<comment>
Yuh, it's MC Escher in da house, we bout to get this party started!! *spins record*

They just doing this to keep me down fr
<comment>
KILL YOURSELF FUCKTARD
All OF YOU
<comment>
Incredibly rude Anon, Please apologize.
<comment>
you can and you will. you won't sleep the same though, you just acclimate to being miserable instead of killing yourself. no matter how little a man has, you will always find that he will settle for less.
<comment>
the last few months i've been working on me baby
there's so much trauma in my life
i've been so cold to the one who love me baby
i look back now and i realizeeeeeee
<comment>
Maybe life will get better after 30

We aren't comparable however 
He survived a suicide attempt around 1 year ago but likely killed himself a while ago
It didn't become better and its impossible to reach out to him

You wanna talk about it at all?
<comment>
my experience of adult life is that it just steadily gets worse 
maybe though
<comment>
I don't know what I want
I don't know what's good for me
What are we supposed to talk about?
That I drink?! Not a big deal, it's nothing.
Let me ...
<comment>
You seem lost in your life. It's a shame really. I loved you and wanted to marry you but some dreams aren't meant to become a reality I guess. 
I was more talking about how you've been recently, I imagine not good if you are doomposting like this...
<comment>
You know I once read a long book called 'The Happiness Hypothesis'
I'm not happy and maybe I have to read it again

<comment>
Please execute me Mr. Evil demon Nazi, I am an inferior gay invalid and need to be disposed of. It would be the greatest orgasm for my tiny lizard brain.
<comment>
I'm just someone 
I wasn't the one you were talking to
I hate myself since I was little
Its a feeling which grows stronger everytime
..................
<comment>
Ah I seem to be delusional! Such a pity. My long lost love is still lost I see. 
If I didn't learn to love myself I would've been dead by my own hands a long time ago. I don't know how to teach you how to love yourself, But I hope you achieve peace. Just try and appreciate the daily in your life. Whatever brings you little joy, embrace it. Run like the wind. I'm a strong man mentally, and no one can take that away from you once you learn to appreciate life more. 
Did any of what I said make sense? Probably not. Such the way life goes. I know I will be blessed in heaven if I die tomorrow anyway. So that brings me comfort.

<comment>
Days of just hearing every gundam opening and ending, going deep in the feels, my life is not over, just in pause while I'm waiting for the end of the world. I couldn't continue with the plan I had of reuniting with the hot guy I've met at intarwebs and be husbandos. The only thing that keeps me sane is HIIT exercising, anime themes, and MMOs. My brain collapses when I try to touch grass and integrate into society. The meds don't do shit no-more. I don't even want a boyfriend anymore, or recognition, I just want to feel satisfied with who I am and what I do, for myself, basically I'm no-one and I do nothing. Sometimes I feel so wacky and spaced out, so in need for emotion that I even feel orgasms from hearing songs, some of the anime openings, I can feel when my brain will have a dry orgasm from just hearing some song with my earplugs or headphones.
<comment>
i don't know about any of that, personally i think my body and mind need at least one year of uninterrupted sleep to bounce back from the unremittent exhaustion jockeying on my back. i feel like waking up out of a coma would do wonders for my health and view of the world. i am far too bitter and tired to continue existing in this state.
<comment>
I sometimes feel suddenly more awake, alive, aware, and it's scary how different it feels
Sometimes I wake up from sleep totally aware that this is it, this is real life and I'm not just an observer sitting in my head, and I look at my hands and wonder who I am 
Sure hope this isnt a warning sign of mental illness haha
I sleep very deeply and dont do well when woken suddenly out of it
One time my dad woke me mid deep sleep and I didnt even recognise him or where I was or anything, so disoriented
<comment>
the only good part of my day is the brief interval between sleep and awakening where i'm not cognizant of who or what i am. as soon as i begin to regain consciousness it feels like i'm being pressure-wrapped in cellophane all around my body, and i'm filled with immense disappointment to return from unconsciousness every time.
<comment>
this kills that
<comment>
What if we are, what are you going to do about it?
<comment>
during that window is when I'm most honest with myself
free from the constraints and masks and tensions I put myself under
typically that means half asleep posting about how much I want a bf whos arms I can curl up in and do other lovey dovey shit, then I fall asleep for another half an hour, then I wake up properly and become a tense and emotionless robot again
<comment>
I'm tempted to griffithmax and let my grow hair extremely long.
Also maybe get a 4 pack or something but I haven't exercised a day in my life Lol.
<comment>
half-asleep is honestly a foreign concept to me. i wake up fairly quickly, though i lay around in bed thinking and dreading the coming day before i can get the energy to force myself out of bed, shovel down pills and food, shower etc 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111
<comment>
its a very risky state to be in and Ive banned myself from messaging anyone I know or making decisions or buying anything while like that
Im far too honest, if I had a crush on a friend Id just straight up tell them while Im half asleep, too risky too risky
<comment>
this is why I adore lucid dreaming
Oregano
<comment>
i'm already plagued by frequent nightmares. every attempt and also every incidental foray into lucid dreaming has been too frightening for me to recount
<comment>
I had thsoe too, but no more.
You could gain more lucidity over the frightening thing (difficult), or you could practice loving kindness meditation (metta) before sleeping so you'll have pleasant dreams.
<comment>
sometimes i think about picard's flute

alright
my birthday is in roughly two months
im gonna lose 20 pounds in that 2 months
I will go from 190 pounds(28 bmi) to 170 pounds(25 bmi) 
In the midsts of its so over within me I found we're so fucking back
<comment>
im gonna lose 20 pounds in that 2 months
how, surgery?
<comment>
I lost like 50 pounds in 5 months by starving myself when I was younger so it could be possible.
<comment>
i had a severe bout of anorexia in my early teens where i was able to lose 70lbs in five weeks with a combination of severe calorie restriction and excessive cardio, so it's definitely possible, idk about healthy though.
<comment>
also for reference i had to be hospitalized twice because i started developing severe anemia and fainting spells from how badly i was treating myself so, be warned
<comment>
one meal a day
drinking only water
if a teenage girl can starve herself
so can I 
and its not like your ancestors starved everyonce and a while
I mean why else would you gain fat if it wasn't supposed to be used in times of crisis
<comment>
what is your favorite type of booger to eat and when was the last time you had it

<comment>
bloody boogers are kino, especially the ones that are a little dry and sitting up in the corner of your nostril, those babies are like heaven to pull outta there
<comment>
I don't eat 'em. I wonder if that's a factor in my mid-tier immunity.

This will be the worst weekend i had in a while but i will survive it. It could've been worse so i'm happy it's 89% shit instead of 100%
Makes me look forward to what comes after as it can only be better, at least very short term. Day by day until next month ends. Yes, it will be a decent month i hope. Not going to start crying about wasted summer just yet. I have planty of time to cry

I feel like the male end of a cable that wants to connect, but two male ends can't slot together and I'm trying to figure out how I can splice them but the circuit won't work like that so I'm learning electronics and adding resistors and switches and I don't smell burning any more but now it won't turn on and I'm wiping solder off the iron and sweat from my brow and there's rust on the contact pads I'm dabbing with isopropyl and crying because everyone else has been having fun right out of the box with their shiny new toys for years and I'm still struggling to fix the trash I was handed and make it work even once

I wish I had a pretend bf at least but I know that's not how feelings work
<comment>

I never buy any breakfast food because I'm, almost never up for it.
<comment>
Go to a diner
<comment>
All feelings are pretend anon, now kiss me
<comment>
How do I deal with the knowledge that every single person I interact with is barely concealing their burning hatred and disgust?
<comment>
They're more afraid of you than you are of them.

i wasn't born to be somebody to someone. i wasn't even born to be somebody to myself. i wasn't born to be anyone at all. i wish i weren't a coward and could just end it all like everyone wants of me.

PSA: I am now wide awake!
And I somehow managed to not touch myself (yet). But I did get pretty angry at you at a certain point, it's kind of frustrating being told what to do, and I believe that I'd actually have a greater chance of abstaining without your involvement in the matter. But your comment on me being "fun" keeps me somehow shackled to you, at least for the time being. Furthermore I just can't shake off this feeling of being "too dirty" to become a good boy(tm) for you :/
<comment>
Anon I can't kiss you just because, I have to like you! Tell me about yourself
<comment>
tfw no bf whose ass I can finger while we make out in bed

If I don't cum I keep being horny, and if I keep being horny I can't concentrate on my puter stuff! I just wanna be done with it already )=
<comment>
If you weren't a coward you'd have gotten lost in the sauce (another man's spunk) already and this wouldn't be a problem
<comment>
tfw Gay and aromantic
I'm like a special snowflake but instead of being a unique because I'm beautiful in a way no one has seen before i'm unique because I'm a totally original brand of horrible shit.
<comment>
You mean a romantic
<comment>
tfw Gay and aromatic
<comment>
I'd just do butt stuff to you and make you have lots of prostate orgasms so I can make you cum endlessly hehe
<comment>
tfw gay and automatic
<comment>
That sounds amazing, but I don't know if anon would approve of it...
<comment>
tfw gay and achromatic
<comment>
Anon doesn't have to know, it'll just be me and you and my bed..
<comment>
But I'll get your bed sheets dirty :(
<comment>
I could easily fap without thinking about him. Just putting this out there.
<comment>
Kill yourself faggot, you are embarrassing
<comment>
pureiya wan
<comment>
I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna start touching my pp
<comment>
stops touching cock
turns aryan
still has no work, no friends, no bf
<comment>
tfw no bf to keep me on a leash like that one anon who can't touch himself
<comment>
I feel like a fiend if I'm not allowed a release. It can't go on like this...
<comment>
I will smash my 4'9" tall bf's face in if he doesn't let me fuck his small tight asshole
<comment>
tfw no bf to forbid from touching himself until he takes me by force
<comment>
Your bf has diarrhea and you're all out of diapers
What do?!
<comment>
The fact that he still hasn't responded is making this that much harder.
<comment>
what
I have a toilet he can just sit there for a while
<comment>
your toilet broke because your fat ass sat on it too long playing tetris on phone.
<comment>
That's it I give up. He can go screw himself.
<comment>
You don't have much patience, do you bunny?
<comment>
I didn't yet finish if it's of any consolation... It's just way too tempting if I'm told not to.
<comment>
hey anon, can you play with me too?
i promise to be good.
<comment>
What's with your discord daddy? He ghosted you?
<comment>
i've got none
imagine using discord
<comment>
You sure didn't act like it.
<comment>
Starting to think that actually all of you people just fucking suck
<comment>
Is it possible to make friends at a gay bar?
<comment>
How come you hate dating apps if you haven't even tried them
<comment>
We do and so do you
<comment>
That's a lot of teenage emo mentality for someone with such an obvious problem. 
You are starved of affection and you need to go to a date and kiss a guy passionately
<comment>
how much I want a bf
So go to the apps and look for one silly boy
<comment>
Me slightly less so though
<comment>
Yeah just like me
<comment>
what does that mean
originally but actually original
<comment>
That you have no idea who i am. retard.
<comment>
Absolutely. It's possible to make friends anywhere if you're down to it. 
Going to a gay bar would be an amazing experience for you, you should really go there
<comment>
That's the inevitable end of trying to flirt with anonymous e strangers, anon
<comment>
Is it possible to make friends
no
<comment>
Don't be so negative. Of course it is possible.
<comment>
I wonder how brazil smells like 
oh wait I know it smells like pure shit
<comment>
Okay anon you're one of the good ones
<comment>
bet you wouldn't say that having a cute brazilian bf like me.
is this hue bait btw?
<comment>
rainforests smell better than your room
<comment>
I bet you're super white...
Mhm minus the sexy bugs crawling in my foreskin.
<comment>
have you ever wondered that there might be a correlation between your racism and your loneliness?
<comment>
Do you pass as gay, anons?
<comment>
If you're really cute, why don't you have a bf, anon?
<comment>
I am not racist I give niggers lots of shots in their face with my glock.
<comment>
Sudacas are subhuman.
<comment>
aren't you the latinx tranny?
<comment>
like a pink and lively sheet of paper. i get a very nice tan with the sun though.
i'm waiting for you anon.
<comment>
i'm bi (mostly into women but still) and i give off a "gay vibe". i fucking hate it. women think i'm gay and gays just want to hook up.
<comment>
maybe your hatred for other races is just a facade to cover some personal issues. Hating others is so easy... A gay should know better.
<comment>
gays just want to hook up.
That's not true. I think it's easier to blame your relationship failures on others
<comment>
I am a strong independent whitexican.
<comment>
Anon, you're not really waiting for me. You're just rotting alone because you're probably too scared to handle real life dating. 
Which is ultimately so silly. You should meet other gay guys where you live so they can show you how silly you are
<comment>
nah ik how much i suck, but the predominant hook up culture is still horrible af. not everyone is like that but it's really hard to find who isnt
<comment>
Holy shit there's always one fucking tard who responds to the monkey, isn't there
<comment>
Suddenly your racism makes a lot more sense now, it's just a tiny part of the whole self hatred saga you've been living for the past decades 
Need I remind everyone how you literally started hrt, lmao
<comment>
i'm bi (mostly into women but still)
I am going to flatten you with a comically large rubber mallet, anon.
<comment>
i want you to show me how silly i am.
make me look all silly too.
<comment>
Oh my gawd, yeah I curb stomp every nigger I see, what are you going to do? try to lecture me about anal protection?
<comment>
ik how much i suck
Doesn't sound like it, when you blame your failure to find a bf on all the other gays instead of taking some of that responsibility. I wish you had stated that "I know how much I suck" in your previous post so you could make it clear that your loneliness is not other gays' fault, but your own 
Hook-up culture is neither predominant nor horrible. But you are.
<comment>
Fags on here don't care, they only want attention, that's the reason why they became gay in the first place.
<comment>
why is hue accusing me of being tranny
<comment>
Maybe he got a point you do avafag. What's next?
<comment>
I can't, we are so very far away, you will never really open your heart to me, not anonymously, not online. You won't bridge the gap (the abyssal crevice) to real life. We would just waste each other's time, which is probably what you're looking forward to. 
You need a real boy, in real life, making eye contact with you, to know how silly you've been. Only then you'll realize how silly it is to be a gay celibate in our world
<comment>
You confessed it in other thread when you were avatarfagging with the green braids fag instead of Griffith. 
You're desperately trying to backtrack it ever since but I won't permit it
<comment>
I am going to go shopping later in search of new cosmetic outfits to showcase my superiority of fellow human beings and listen to pop music. What about you Sir Anon?
<comment>
you're welcome to try, anon 
where tf did i blame it or mention anything about failing to land a bf? it's a problem but not a life ender.
<comment>
little video about cocktail psychology
reveals after a few seconds that to make men buy more they added pics of the glass it comes in, so that they'd opt for something that looks cheap and manly
i picked one of the gayest looking glasses
well. atleast i beat him.
<comment>
what anon are you?
sounding very similar to the one that keeps pushing people to go find others irl.
and who is an all around massive faggot.
<comment>
Sounds like me when I thought being gay is something special
<comment>
Don't talk to me sociopathic sudacel

yes he's fucking hue you retard holy shit
<comment>
who's hue? i'm new here.
<comment>
figure it out by responding to him 2 hours long
<comment>
the one that keeps pushing people to go find others irl.
that guy, now for fuck's sake quit feeding the trolls
<comment>
Anyone know if there are any train mods that are compatible with TFC.
<comment>
hue is a vigilant amazonigger with an axe to grind and a promised pension from tinder and grindr if he continues shilling dating apps. he's been coming to these threads *very* frequently for the last few years and shows no signs of retreat. he draws people in with the weakest bait imaginable and clogs up the thread arguing with his catches for hours at a time, continually putting essentially the same zero effort response in slightly different phrasing over and over and over again, and raking in the (You)'s from new idiots to the thread who have a compulsive need to defend themselves against any slight even if it's an obvious troll.
frankly, it amuses me to no end that he does it so well, and no matter the warnings that other anons give to newfags about to fall into his trap, the newfags never seem to listen and respond almost invariably with braindead "i'll do what i want" and etc responses, only to be dragged into a closed circuit of identical responses for 250 posts. the guy is an artiste, i'll concede that.
<comment>
Phew, alright I'm all done now. Do I regret it? Not really I think. But I do think that the timeline in which I didn't fail you has a larger appeal than this one. What do you think of me now anon? I at least hope that you realize now that I'm no fun at all, and in fact, constitute the bottom of the barrel :D
Also, how many friends do you have?

<comment>
Hey! Yes you there, eighteen year old anon, how's it going?
<comment>
no, i don't have much of anything these days
<comment>
how about having some of me?
<comment>
It's okay. Nothing special. I assume your are speaking to me since I have made that information public.
What about you Sir Anon?
<comment>
i think it's too late in the game for me to start banking on some far-fetched hope now anon
<comment>
Believe it or not I actually wasn't aiming at anyone particular. Was just curious, that's all. Good to hear that your affairs aren't amiss despite probably not being in order either. If you need me I'm here, you know that right?
As for me, well, could be better I suppose. After loosing the /fit-lit/ anon, I feel very much like a loser among losers. Which, in all fairness, does make me kinda smug hihi.
<comment>
I think smugness might be the single least attractive personality trait there is desu
<comment>
the one that keeps pushing people to go find others irl.
Sounds like he's based as fuck
<comment>
eighteen was seven years ago
ah, good old suifuel
<comment>
You should really give dating apps a try, you've got nothing to lose
<comment>
I downloaded dating apps and now I am rich ;)
<comment>
I strained my wrist while pooping yesterday. Hurt pretty badly, but I think it's healed now.
<comment>
Nice to hear that. Be sure to go to an irl date, otherwise it won't be much different from talking to gays here
<comment>
I didnt fucking ask you for your opinion. Fuck off
<comment>
No, you fuck off. 
Seriously though, you haven't had a date yet. How about we change that? You could have a date today. It's just a few clicks away. 
Where would you like to take a guy for a first date by the way? Anywhere cool where you live, like a park or a beach or an ice cream shop? 
I just love ice cream for a first date
<comment>
Should I let my hair grow super long?
<comment>
Even responding to hue to tell him to fuck off is taking the bait
<comment>
You DID read the rules before posting, right?
<comment>
Really? source? you sexy baby
<comment>
why do all you faggots think any sexual remark means i want to meet irl or actually have any sort of contact?
are the new /r9gay/ threadgoers just lonely faggots who gave up?
<comment>
80% of this thread are prisonfags
<comment>
Should I look more effeminate and less attractive? 
please don't
<comment>
I'm already very feminine. I was also going to replace my glasses with some cuter looking ones cause the current ones I have look like the chud meme ones. My hair is already shoulder length.
<comment>
shoulder length hair is best desu
<comment>
desu indeed, retard
<comment>
Identified yet another "anon" mwahahah >:)
<comment>
identfy this, dumbass *whips out dick*
<comment>
Should I look even less attractive than I currently am?
It depends, do you have any intention of not being a lonely celibate seemingly forever? 
shoulder length
Virgin alert
<comment>
Said the bfless virgin
<comment>
obviously you should not be responding to hue
<comment>
Mhm, mhm. Okay, okay I see. Now I might not be 100% correct, but this does very much look like a penis. So I'll lock that in as my final answer please.
<comment>
I JUST BOUGHT MORE LAND IN THE METAVERSE
<comment>
Hue is scared of feminine males? This is a new revelation.
<comment>
You've never been to a date, kissed a guy or held hands with one before. 
How about we got these three milestones covered tonight, in one single swoop?
Just a few clicks away
<comment>
no, he just pretends to have a retarded vendetta because it gets (You)s
<comment>
I am trans and I don't date men.
<comment>
Long hair for males is just unattractive, I'm sorry if this hurts your feelings. 
You can check it for yourself by seeing people's reaction to your looks.
<comment>
I don't date men
Or anyone, really
<comment>
retards thinking they can out-troll hue
that's a great way of making sure the thread is unusable for the next twelve hours
<comment>
Women and Men stare at me all the time due to my beauty.
<comment>
No I dated 2 female girls. Look I don't have to prove to you anything, what do you want from me? Are you ok?
Oy vey I can't drop my blogposts
<comment>
due to my beauty
They are bewildered by your cringe hair
<comment>
YOU are a sexy princess, and they have no idea how you pull it off, like do you work out?
<comment>
you dated so many girls you're stuck in the gay celibate thread

You're like the incarnate evidence of how waiting around for a bf will get you nowhere
Friends 
The e-friends you've never met before?

<comment>
that ship sailed long ago.
<comment>
On getting a bf?
<comment>
The only way to remain single when you have a dating life is if you want to. The opportunities just come and you take them. It would happen to you too, if you stopped hiding in your room.
<comment>
I leave you alone now, you are obviously scared of me.
<comment>
Scared of a virgin who's too scared to go out and have a date? 
Frightened. Terrorized even. 
When will you do something to get a bf other than waiting in inaction?
<comment>
do gaybots think of doing something degrading or romantic to their fbf?
i wonder how many would enjoy some self-degradation from the partner's side.
<comment>
You should worry more about how to get a bf, and less about super specific hypothetical scenarios of things you want to do to them

<comment>
I also havent showered in three days
Don't want to wash away my aryan vril
<comment>
I'm so glad you asked that. First you download dating apps. Then you talk to people over there. Then you go to a date and meet each other. 
Repeat this until you've found him.
<comment>
I already did this, I only found fat brazil sluts
<comment>
Oh chud... You're so lonely and so broken
<comment>
everyone around me is fat 
These cheap generalizations are the true mark of someone who has never tried. We see it all the time in here, usually it's "everyone is 45, fat and disgusting". 
Unfortunately that is not the whole truth. You're not the only young gay person in a radius, but if other young gay guys are rejecting you, what does that say about you?
<comment>
My brother is gay, should I date him?
<comment>
the only one that answers is hue
and you say there's no good posting.
<comment>
eh but it could always get worse
its better to be alone with a home
than alone and homeless
you feel me
sometimes you gotta cum in the sink to not sink in the cum
<comment>
Incest is illegal here, but tell me more, is your brother a lonely celibate like you? Imagine having an incel brother
<comment>
he is in the elementary school at the moment, he loves math.
<comment>
it could always get worse
Worse than being a lonely lunatic spreading hate online? 
It could be a lot better too, you know. You could have a friend and a bf, but no, you have to be this hateful caricature
<comment>
tfw no bf to give me brain damage and make me into an abdl slut for him
<comment>
whats an Abdul slut
<comment>
how exactly do you reckon he's gay? 
He plays with the idea of dating his kid brother
Leave him alone, you pedo
<comment>
you could have friends
lame!
but no you have to be this hateful caricature
yes the hateful action of telling people on the internet "good morning :3" 
This is practically a holocaust. This is another shoah
<comment>
He already has a bf, by following your advice.
<comment>
wish that i was anon's kid brother
<comment>
lame!
You're lame. You ditch friends with one hand and with the other you come crying about loneliness in here. 
Friends are the spice of life. So sad that you don't have any. No wonder you're so bitter
<comment>
Lmao your kid brother who's in elementary school is already out of the closet and already has a bf...
And you're still there being stuck as a lonely celibate? 
Seems like you have so much to learn from your brother
<comment>
ditch friends
i never ditched anyone. 
you come crying about loneliness here
i make good morning posts
friends are the spice of life
then what are actual spices? Are they just not apart of life now? Dey yt ppl don season they food.
<comment>
So you're okay with him dating a 24 year old?
<comment>
rude, im not that old...
<comment>
never ditched anyone.
Friendless
Be honest with yourself for a minute
<comment>
Your kid brother is dating an adult pedophile and instead of calling the cops you come here to talk about it? 
Anon, are you just making shit up to distract us from your failure to get a bf?
<comment>
ESL reading comprehension
<comment>
Uh yeah
I haven't had friends since I was in middle school dude
I didn't ditch them 
I just moved away 
Shit sucks life happens
Sometimes you just lose the social game you feel me homie?
<comment>
You are pedophobic...wow...shame on you
<comment>
I didn't ditch them
You ditched all the people in highschool and after that who could have potentially become your friends. 
Same thing for a bf. 
You moved away to the middle of a desert? No, there are still people right there where you live, including single gay guys who you could date. And yet, you refuse to. 
Being a lonely chud is currently your priority in life. Like smoking crack is a crackhead's priority
<comment>
Anyone else have a distinctive cycle of fetishes?
<comment>
Your imaginary brother and his pedophile abuser won't change the fact that you're a lonely celibate, but anon for the love of god

How the fuck do I defeat the autism stare and take an okay selfie

Ok officer you got me! Send me to jail for 1000 years for having poor social skills in highschool....
<comment>
God? What God would make you transphobic, pedophobic a nazi and a racist?
<comment>
That class photo before high school graduation is probably gonna be the last one ever taken of me.
<comment>
anon, could you explain to me why you're responding to hue?
<comment>
Maybe you look ok and you're just insecure ?
<comment>
I had poor social skills in highschool too, anon. But instead of blaming everyone for my loneliness way into my 20s, I just grew up and developed social skills through continuous attempts, lots of tries and lots of errors until I landed myself a group of friends who couldn't fit in anywhere else, so we banded together. 
I wish you would do something similar, but instead you're stuck in this self pity loop of blaming everyone else for your troubles and doing nothing to improve your loneliness.
<comment>
no, there's definitely something off
my eyes look weird and my face is poorly shaped and I can't smile without looking awful
it's a shame because I actually have pretty nice features

It's gon be okay

Try having a first date before you're 30
<comment>
Try leaving this place before you're 30
<comment>
Or maybe you just have low self esteem?
Nice facial features
Looks bad on pictures 
How about you just use the pictures you have on dating apps and let others guys be the judge? You might be surprised
<comment>
don't you have fucking anything better to be doing on a saturday evening, jesus
<comment>
Stop making fun of incels before 30
No, you're just too much fun.
<comment>
Yeah that's it dude.
<comment>
okay, congratulations, you got hue to admit he's just here to stir shit. what's the next step in your master plan?
<comment>
I'll probably go out with my friends tonight but it doesn't hurt to do a little bit of shitposting before that
<comment>
Reading comic
<comment>
It wouldn't be it if you stopped being a lonely celibate now, would it? 
Your salvation is only one click away. Have a normal dating life even though you're not normal, it's doable.
<comment>
couldn't you have just started with that
<comment>
No I was bored.

I don't care

You do care. You cared enough to respond. It's your life, anon. You're not happy being all alone, so why keep inflicting that sort of pain on yourself?
You really hate yourself that much?
Just stop. Go kiss a boy
<comment>
Should I go out with my friends, or should I shitpost all night long?
<comment>
How about this: we all cuddle together and talk about our feelings. You start anon, we're listening.
<comment>
You're not bisexual you're just afraid to admit you like men
<comment>
I gotta be extra careful with this. Once I press that button, there's no going back
<comment>
i'm extremely horny, pretty well elsewhere.
your turn.
<comment>
the best part is when they come to the gay thread everyday to say how much they prefer women
<comment>
i mean it's not like you can just fucking go somewhere and say hey i know i'm in my mid twenties but i'm an emotionally stunted fucking retard and don't even know how to ask for a haircut or what i want to do with my appearance so it feels like my only option is to sit here wanting to throw up just thinking about it until i kill myself
<comment>
it's not like you can just fucking go somewhere
You can. Your fears may hold you down, but you have the potential to best them.
Your options are nearly endless. All you have to do is try. You can start with the dating apps. 
my only option is to sit here
Please don't do that.
<comment>
What's this about anon? Do you have a fallback plan?
A bit regretful that I fapped twice today. And I guess other than that I'm feelin' pretty lazy.

Indians are literally not even close to human, same with niggers; in fact, only white people can be considered human with souls.
<comment>
I wonder what the boys are up to, seeing as they aren't posting all that much...

<comment>
I'm not the one playing it currently but I did back in the day some. Since I had wow before runescape I mostly played wow.

I used to consume so much wow related content when I was younger, despite never actually going past like lvl 30. That was back when danger dolan still used to make vids on it.

<comment>
i know ): someone should make one.
<comment>
i'm not prescribed any. maybe i should be? idk i don't like medication
<comment>
I know sweetie, that's why you could try therapy instead. What if you try some new hobbies? Do you have anyone with whom you could talk with?
<comment>
that would actually probably be a pretty cool thing to do desu
<comment>
someone tell me to go to bed instead of staying up until 3am wanting to kill myself again please

i have a few hobbies but, i've started a work from home job and it's making me insane. i don't do the hikki lifestyle and it's driving me insane ): but im so tired after work
<comment>
im actually probably a pretty cool guy
<comment>
*clears throat*
go to bed instead of staying up until 3am wanting to kill yourself again anon
Maybe try changing surroundings during the day? Or just take a nap?
<comment>
i've tried the changing the surrounding thing. i'm still going pretty insane sadly. i think i need to quit and go back to in person work ):
<comment>
okay anon you make a compelling argument
<comment>
That sounds like a good idea. Hope it works nonny! &lt;3
And I mean if push comes to shove you could always become addicted to stimulants, so don't worry.

indian
only talked to one non american indian and he seemed alright but im anti accented people so we could never communicate with speech
<comment>
How bout English accent ?
Or Irish one?
<comment>
depends on the clarity of the accent
<comment>

I don't like the Californian one

Tonight I'm having another hot chocolate because its like a hug you can drink and I crave comfort
I put a mango rum in it this time, it clashes a bit but it's ok
<comment>
Clashes how?
Sounds great!!
<comment>
I'm not sure, I'm terrible at describing tastes
I guess maybe the sweetness of the mango rum and the sweetness of the chocolate are like competing with each other? 
Last week I tried whisky and regular dark rum and they worked great because they like compliment the chocolate without drowning it out I guess? 
It's still nice just not as good as those
<comment>
It happened a while ago. I'm not sure i can cope with losing someone i cared about so much. Some days just hit different that's all
<comment>
I see
Hmmmm, you think it would go well with honey Jack?
I guess most fruit y ones will feel a little odd like that
<comment>
Sometimes we cant, it draga on for loooong and years after we still feel it, tho
I think it can help be a better person
<comment>
i dont mind american accents(im american) the only one i can think of specifically is whatever baltimore accent though i think its just a black thing and im sure most of the other ones i dont like are just some black thing(im not racist)
california
im not sure which you mean but they are annoying but for me this one is because of vocabulary
<comment>
Vocabulary ?
Black accents and ways of speech are a bit odd but I think they're fun sometimes
<comment>
yeah the honey jack one worked pretty great
baileys still works the best I think but I like trying new things
<comment>
Yeah... life kinda sucks like that, doesn't it?

Make a Google form idk. (good luck) People here are pretty polarized on trans shit so would be hard to tell without instant shit-flinging

100%, without a doubt. Every person here is repressed trans.
idk I had some eggs this morning though

But transitioning isn't a magic wand swooshing you to cute girl-dom, so it will forever remain a sad what-if.
I'm a boy and i like being a boy, i just also like being cute and effeminate
Groomer mentality
boys aren't worth grooming

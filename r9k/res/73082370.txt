Fuck off subhuman mosquito. You have to be human to post here

Hopefully at some point everyone on this board can come to terms with their true identity. Hopefully they can accept themselves for who they are.

I would offer to be your bf, but my being here on this board unfortunately implies that I am also a repressed MtF.

I wouldn't prefer to be a woman because I think I /am/ a woman; I would prefer to be a woman because my personality traits, which have rendered me a weak, timid, terrified KHHV wizard male of zero value, would, in female figure, render me of at least average value and completely transform my life.
But transitioning isn't a magic wand swooshing you to cute girl-dom, so it will forever remain a sad what-if.

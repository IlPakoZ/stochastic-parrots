Porn consumption and addiction doesn't mean anything, I used to watch porn and jerk off everyday but then I took SSRI's and they annihilated my libido and now I don't masturbate or watch porn anymore so basically I'm on eternal nofap and guess what? I'm still a fucking irredeemable loser and nothing has changed. This nofap shit needs to stop.

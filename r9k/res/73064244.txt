I remember from around 9-19 women where my favorite thing in the world.
Men were mouth breathers who would act agressive and make strange noises.
At least in the 90's girls were a lot nicer than guys, especially non beta males. 
Girls have saved me from getting my 5,8 ass kicked ny chad multiple times. And always seem to be able to calm down violent "alphas".
It wasnt until I started going on this page and incel forums that I started to have bad feeling and thoughts about women.
Now Im scared to even look at them, my head is crammed full of r9k dating statistics.
From now on when I see a cute girl my age, I no longer think of her innocenece.
I think about all the men who she throught were better than me, who she let come first.
In terms of how she feels about men she views me at the bottom of the totem pole.
Now Im starting to not even like my female friends anymore, they all rejected me and have boyfriends now, so maybe they dont even like my company :(
good for you, but this never happened for us.
women don't even consider us human, much less save us from anything.
I don't share this board's simping of chads, I think they're almost all dark triad bullies, but that doesn't improve my opinion of women.
there are definitely bad men, but there are men who are helpful and at least who see you as a person. while for ugly men, women are not helpful at all and are at best indifferent and at worst consider you subhuman.
so you can continue to have a rose-tinted view of women, but don't invalidate our experiences just because yours were different.

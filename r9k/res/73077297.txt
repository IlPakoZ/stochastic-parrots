Nope. I want to love you instead, love, love, love
Also wishing you a happy birthday for this year, even if it has gone.

I'm open to explanations as to why I should
Will you hate me 
I don't even know who you are.
i cant hate you anon, will you forgive me?
sure!
i think its justified to hate people in general
the first arguement is from moral failure
humans are moral abominations. the poster in the op has lied, hurt others, ate animals and caused horrific animal suffering as a result, and exhibited pride, arrogance and enjoyment in the face of the unjustified suffering they have created
everyone is a moral failure, moral failures deserve to be hated, therefor everyone deserves to be hated
that means you too
I think I'll just hate you for being the vegan retard instead
ate animals
I think it's time to go and eat some animals right now!! mmmmmm tasty
ur a pusyfag!!!!!!!!!!
see what i mean?
you are moral failures, and you throw a tantrum when you are reminded of it
you dont deserve love
you deserve all the suffering you have in life, because you are worthless human trash
all of you are, including op

I can't keep pretending that things get better. I tried, oh Lord i tried. I wanted to be the crab pulling others out of the bucket, but it's my nature as a crab that I'm not good at climbing and will inevitably fall back in myself. 
I'm likely going to rope very soon.
For what it is worth anon, I feel you. I try to be that guy as well, but am suffering many of the same issues that you yourself have mentioned. The only thing I can tell you is try to keep your head up no matter what happens, life is fucked but you're doing God's work by trying to help other anons who suffer a similar fate. No matter how cope it is continue to believe in a better tomorrow
Bumping my own reply but yeah, my girlfriend left me too and I still deal with that on the daily, but all you can do is move past it, also balding too (LOL) nothing you can do unless you want to hop on fin and min. Oneitis comes and goes don't put too much hope in that, even if other anons aren't willing to improve their lives you're still a good person for trying to help them, anybody willing to improve this site at this point gets my blessing
I also know that feeling of having a dry phone, regardless if you really have a lot of people to talk try to keep a positive mindset, it'll work out don't let the doomers and blackpillers and lookism fags get you down

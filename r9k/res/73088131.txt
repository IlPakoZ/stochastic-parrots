I just turned 23 and I'm still a mentalcel with no post secondary education or work experience. My parents and my grandparents were married by their early 20s and had kids by their mid 20s. How much time do you reckon I have if I want to break into the middle class, get married and have kids?

I think you're defcon level 3 of fucked. You need to hit a fat reversal asap my friend. Don't listen to >>73088134 you've still got time just not much. You have to do SOMETHING. Anything is better than nothing. Working sweeping leaves would be a fucking monumental improvement from where you are now. You're 23 so you're still young, if you were 27 then yeah it'd be over.

Why is your outlook on 27 so bad? You're making me insecure.

I have a GED, I can do better than sweeping leaves. I've worked factory jobs that pay 15 an hour before. Not that I would mind sweeping leaves.
90% of robots are divorced from reality, it's no really over until you're dead. It just gets extremely hard to improve your life when you're in your late 20s or 30s and haven't done anything.

25-26 is defcon level 2, your shit is fucked and needs to be unfucked. At age 27-28, if you've not got any experience in anything, you're going to be playing catch up well into your 30s. That is something you DON'T wanna be doing. Who's more likely to get employed, the 29 year old with 8 years experience or the 33 year old with 4? You're 23 so you've got time but you have to realise. YOU'RE RUNNING OUT. Soon you'll be 24, then 25 and before you know it you'll be 27. If you've hit 27 without ever having a job or even leaving the house. You better invest in some high vis and start picking trash, you can't spend 10 years checked out in front of a computer without seriously fucking your shit up. Volunteer at a soup kitchen or something that'll help improve your social skills, main thing is to be doing something. If that something is polishing pots for a living that's fine, not perfect but it's SOMETHING. Doing nothing and playing Kenshi for 4 thousand hours isn't going to help you.

Plenty of time, I think 40 would be the cut off for starting to get your shit together. By the time you gathered resources and independence, the women your age would be too old to have children. 
I got my first job at 26, I was NEET for a long time after graduating high school. It was pretty easy to reintegrate into society. I mean, I'm a little quiet and weird, maybe a little goofy, because of my time in isolation, but people still seem to like me.
I gained so much being NEET, no regrets. The things I had time to learn, I solved boredom and found inner peace. All the problems people run into when they retire, I've already solved. Problems that retirees wont even see coming.

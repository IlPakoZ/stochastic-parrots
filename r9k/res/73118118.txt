What is the dark web like
scams, drugs and other illegal electronic services like pics or videos you can be arrested for having looked at.
Is there 4chan equivalent dark web
yes but they generally suck. imagine a 4chan where the most unhinged schizos ramble nonsense thinking they outsmarted the government who deficiently keep track of their every move.
trying to browse it aimlessly is like setting sail in an ocean of piss with no plan or knowledge of sailing. unless you know where you're going and know how to get there its all piss.

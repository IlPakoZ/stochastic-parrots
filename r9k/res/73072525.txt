Thoughts on male zoomers?
<comment>
The ones in your picture are athletic and handsome, they won't end up in this board

They are all at the very least bisexual 
The GAYEST or most openly GAY generation in history

None of picrel are gay.

I'm 25 years old.
Zoomers are... benign.
They're normal.
They're human specimens that walk and talk and play video games.
They have very strange humor and taste in music, but in general they're just pretty chill.
Millenials are not like this whatsoever. They take everything extremely seriously all the time. They get mad if you trigger a microagression and yell at you about how you're upholding a systemic structure of systemic colonialist prejudice.
you're a zoomer at 25
This discussion happens every time.
It's directly on that line between Gen Z and millennial. Like directly on it.
This makes my existence kind of strange. Because on either side of me there are two drastically different modes of being and I often feel like I'm violently pulled in either direction.
I feel like anyone younger than me has a very difficult time making sense of this world that they were born into.

I have never met a male zoomer who could grow facial hair, it's weird. Even the "masculine" ones in their early twenties can't grow any facial hair at all.

My friend born in 04 has a righteous beard but he's a manlet. Life is suffering lads

I know I was talking about male zoomers in general

Look exactly as millennials did in high school. What is the difference?

There's an absolutely massive and profound generational gap between millenials and zoomers. Like I said here >>73072943
what's the difference
It's a huge conversation.
The quickest and most succinct way to sum it up is that Apple happened.
When Apple happened, the world stopped being complex, detailed, intricate and became minimalist and monolithic.
If you squint, a millenial and a zoomer might immediately look the same. But they are lightyears apart.

I am one. It sucks because I'm a complete robot of a person with no emotion and no friends or gf and was completely ignored in highschool. Honestly don't know If I would have rather at least been bullied

We used to have a name for that

They're boomers and millenialls mixed together in a poopy blender. They have less loyalty to each other, than any other generation of men. It's concerning. But the ones that are based, are very based.

Retarded sense of humor. Flat affect monotone guys. Dogshit taste in music.

A guy described this as a classic to me. 
Kinda funny sometimes.

I don't know a single person my age who isn't a benign misogynist, homophobic, racist or all. Everyone hates and really mistrusts the government too. Also really into working out compared to older generations, when I go to the gym it's 90% zoomers in there. I'm eastern european though so things my be different elsewhere. Also everyone is really fucking tall. I'm 6' but I feel like I'm super average and I know tons of dudes who are 6'2" or over.
Zoomers girls are also super sluts or virgin until marriage types with 0 inbetween.

Eastern European
How can this be?

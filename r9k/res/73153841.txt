I used to hate fotm seasonal anime crap but I enjoyed the first of recent Demon Slayer run. I watched a bit of Oshi no ko and it's really bad.

I watched a bit of Oshi no ko and it's really bad.
It's literally the highest rated anime of all time 
This is like saying the godfather was mid 
Why be contrarian
<comment>
Anime takes too long to watch I just scour the seasonal page to see if theres anything interesting and if there is I read the manga(pirated ofc)
I typically like aka akasakas works but since normies found it I have started hating it
<comment>
I am not being contrarian. It's genuinely shit tier. Normies hype up everything. Fucking recent bleach season was highly rated. Anyone who read the manga when it was being written would tell you how everyone was seething at the garbage plot.
Whats the appeal of Kaguya sama? It's kinda boring.

this season?
Spring 2023? The typical answers. Hell's Paradise, Demon Slayer, Konosuba Megumin Edition, Heavenly Delusion, Dead Mount Death Play. No fucking clue how Oshi no Ko is somehow ranked 1 on Myanimelist now. I checked it out and, while it's good, it is NOT better than most of the kino sitting in the top 100.

Favorite by far is kamikatsu. Jigokuraku, Tengoku Daimakyou and KnY are also good (although fish cgi in KnY sucks lol not sure how ufotable fucked up this big). Watching a bunch of others as well: megumin spin-off, yuusha ga shinda, kawaisugi crisis, nee-san isekai, mashle and megami no cafe terrace.

It's Samus from Metroid. She's taller than you and would turn your cock into ashes.

She is exactly as tall as me.Always wanted a girl like that. Those days are far gone though lol

There are a lot of good shows, but nothing really jumps out as especially great. Houkago Insomnia, Skip to Loafer, Konosubakuen, Kamikatsu, Dr. Stone, Magical Destroyers, Edomae Elf, Tengoku, Jijou wo Shiranai Tenkousei. If I really had to pick one, I'd probably go with Elf, that's probably the most polished and consistently enjoyable one.
all the bandwagoning casuals are saying that it's the best anime ever, how could so many people be wrong?

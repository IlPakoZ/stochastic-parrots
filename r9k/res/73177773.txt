last day today to apply to some practical schools (tradies, bunch of other shit in construction and more)
Look over what's available
Get completely demoralized again and realize I don't wanna do none of this stuff the city is offering (might even get to study free for a year)
I'm having a mental breakdown again, slept like 1-2 hours just to get my welfare application in and send In this school crap, started at 8-9am I'm just now finished at 10pm, and I'm completely exhausted and depressed from the constant stress hormones pumping around all day and the anxiety
Idk if I'm going back to school I don't wanna do this crap, unless maybe I apply for hs and just do theoretical courses again, I don't wanna come a tradie in construction or some shit
I don't even wanna go back to school 
I'm fucking done for I'm so tired 
I have no desire for this crap

Overheard my mom saying she's going to file for bankruptcy
Wonder what this means for me, a 30 year old stay at home NEET

My mother has never been more poor than right now as far as I know. I've been lending her money when she needs a little help, but it's not looking good. I'm also a NEET right now, and I have no idea what I'll do if I have to go back to work. 
Maybe we can both try for govt handouts. I swear to god she has never been given anything in life, she even tried for social security last year and they said she made too much.

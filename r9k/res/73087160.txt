girlfriend constantly online in WhatsApp
I am not the one she is texting
Yikes my guy, I didn't realize until I got older, but it's really easy to tell when a girl is texting someone else other than you at the same time. It's also really easy to tell when you're that guy.
Sage words to never forget:
She's not yours, it is (was) just your turn.
Lol its fucking over bro
Okay, she is texting me with random stuff again. Guess everything is good :>

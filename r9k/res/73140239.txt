is there any point in going to an anime convention alone with no interest in anime? 
I want to befriend outcast weirdos irl and this is the only way I can think to do it, but the only weeb shit I know about is dbz and maybe fma
is there a better way to find what I'm after or should I start binging stuff im not really invested in

It just seems stupid to me. The levels of autism I will see there will make me want to blow my brains out.

Most people who go to those cons have only seen NGE and Attack On Titan.

I don't see the point in going to any sort of social situation completely alone.

To buy weeb merch like dvds of your fav anime that aren't always available online.

thats the only reason I've got a shot
so if you've got no friends you're just stuck that way?

Mostly. You can force it, but it's going to be hard and you better not give up when you inevitably face a bunch of rejection and awkward situations.

no I'm not that way, im sorry if you are but I have no problem going to social events alone, the problem is common ground with other people there

Based, I've thought about doing this myself, but don't want to seem like a weirdo by not fitting in. I can just imagine a group of autists shunning me because I don't have anime knowledge

What's your endgame in befriending said weirdos?
I'm watching you.

my endgame is to have weirdo friends :/
I've tried normie friends we don't mesh well

U know apps like Grindr are just easy ways to kidnap people.
Ive catfished so many men and they would meet up in most randomest remote areas cause my dick was big or had Abs. And most of the time its white fags as well.
You are telling me it's completely encrypted and anonymous so feds wouldn't know, pfff right.
If u dont know how to hide yourself on the internet then ur just retarx. Im using 4chan through a proxy now and have been banned multiple times but Jannies cant do shit . The Jannies are my bitch and they know if they do Try to go after me Ill reign hell on them . I even know one personally
you're telling me you kidnapped white twinks to make them your personal sex slaves?

You're supposed to meet at a bar.
I've had 1 out of 1 good experience in online dating. But I have a female friend who's kind of hot, I think she uses the famous dating apps. I think in the beginning she'd screen the guys at a bar before taking them home. But now she gives them her address directly. She's shy, so I don't think she video calls before.
Maybe famous apps, at least apps for straight people, do good job weeding out dangerous and fake profiles.

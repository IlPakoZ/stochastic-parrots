i feel like i would probably go with leisure even if im kinda shamed to admit it
Adventure. I will find my elfwife or die trying. Elf pussy or death.
life of comfort is so fucking overpowered it's not even funny
whichever one ends up with me shooting cum inside the most amount of women
Eh I'm a sucker for the life of adventure stuff, so that. Warrior class for sure. A lot of the other options sound great as well, I love memes like these.
Good works seems super legit
Is some vague adventure really worth the chance of dying from cholera in the middle of nowhere?
Adventure if I can do an immortality spell as a wizard. Otherwise, the not aging part of leisure if just too good, and it has more things to do than good works.
A life of comfort without a doubt, are you kidding? Fuck all the supernatural shit I would kill to have a decent life like that without having to violently struggle for it. I could pursue anything I want without having to worry about finances. I could live the normal life I always wanted to have. But most of all, I would have someone who loves me completely without the nonsense of the modern era.
It's an easy choice for me without a doubt. I've had, and still live, a very hard life.
Definitely. Although if I have perfect human strength and health, hopefully it wouldn't be to something so lame. I live a life of general comfort / lesiure already and it's fairly boring.
Sounds like being a dentist but quadruple the salary.
Adventure. I love fantasy worlds and hope I can be cured of my disability affecting muscle strength and balance and my heart requirements of heart medicine 
I would be a wizard
The fourth one desu
INSIDIOUS POWER SET 100%
im going to give people completely unwarranted advice while invisible :3
This would literally be the most fun I'd ever have in my life and I would kill to have this power. I didn't even read the other options fuck them
too easy
adventure

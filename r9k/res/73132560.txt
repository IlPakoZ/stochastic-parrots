Eh I'm a sucker for the life of adventure stuff, so that. Warrior class for sure. A lot of the other options sound great as well, I love memes like these.

Good works seems super legit
Is some vague adventure really worth the chance of dying from cholera in the middle of nowhere?
<comment>
Adventure if I can do an immortality spell as a wizard. Otherwise, the not aging part of leisure if just too good, and it has more things to do than good works.

A life of comfort without a doubt, are you kidding? Fuck all the supernatural shit I would kill to have a decent life like that without having to violently struggle for it. I could pursue anything I want without having to worry about finances. I could live the normal life I always wanted to have. But most of all, I would have someone who loves me completely without the nonsense of the modern era.
It's an easy choice for me without a doubt. I've had, and still live, a very hard life.

Definitely. Although if I have perfect human strength and health, hopefully it wouldn't be to something so lame. I live a life of general comfort / lesiure already and it's fairly boring.

Sounds like being a dentist but quadruple the salary.

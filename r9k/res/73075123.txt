This image is so stupid
<comment>
Video games give unrealistic expectations about what being shot with a firearm is like. It's not -10 HP, it's the excruciating destruction of your muscle, bones and organs.

Perfect depiction of the bucket-of-crabs mentality that this place has whenever an anon says he wants to lose weight or get a better career or improve social skills.

A lasgun is like a flashlight to which you attached a couple extra D batteries.
<comment>

Autistic universes are so gay and cringe. Only neurotypicals can create good fiction

Is this warhammer or some shit? idk where this is from
<comment>
the most stupid thing i can see here is what look like unaugmented humans even attempting to attack a Sister of Silence and a Custodian
Both would wipe the fucking floor with them in a heartbeat
<comment>
custodes
SoS
caring about retards with lasguns
not even remotely a threat. There are custodes who have fought with half their brain chopped off, and vs demons/chaos marines
<comment>
The big dude is a custodes he's a genetically engineered dude his skull is harder than steel
<comment>
he has eye sockets
<comment>
custodes are completely retarded
if he gets shot directly in the eyeball he would probably not lose sight in it
he would still massacre everything in the room effortlessly with one eye. If he had no eyes he would do the same thing based on sound
Also good luck shooting something that can move faster than sight in an eyeball with a shitty inaccurate gun before it rips you in half
they're retardedly op super soldiers anon, 4 of them fought an entire tyranid swarm to a standstill
<comment>
He can fight with half a brain only as another anon said. Creating and armoring one is more expensive than the worth on an entire planet in the setting.

wake up at 4:30 AM

cook breakfast at home
Dogshit. I've been awake since 1 AM and it is now nearly 10. About to take my first meeting and then pretend to be productive for the rest of the day until I can try to go home and sleep in a non retarded manner.
wake up at 5:30AM
get ready, iron clothes
make breakfast/lunch (I usually eat my breakfast at 9AM) while listening to morning news
leave at 6:45AM to drive 5 minutes to my train ride to work

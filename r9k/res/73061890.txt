Are you over 30 and a virgin? Why?
I'm 30 and a virgin because I've never in my life pursued women and porn fucked up my brain so I can't get hard when being intimate with girls
just turned 33
i don't leave the house for any reason other than work and talking to anyone but my mum makes me uncomfortable, being behind a computer is my life

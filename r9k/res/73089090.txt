I look like the guy in the pic, are cute girls like that attainable?
go for the kpop look 
but at the same time get ripped and have messy hair
I'm white and I would say a 7/10 and my bf looks like that. Isnt even korean, he is chinese. I just have yellow fever lol.
even with the kpop thing... you can look 'objectively' nice and it will still boil down to whether she has a thing for asians or not. Most girls don't even register you as a option so there aren't really any degrees meh-maybe-cute-hot as it is with white guys.
Wake-up call: there is no such thing as leagues in the strict sense. Yes, the hobo on the street with rotten teeth or the fat 4chan bozo won't get the prettiest girl in the street. In fact, if you go by dating apps alone then the average Joe is also operating on reduced odds. 
But when it comes like being from a certain race, having a beard or not, wearing glasses or not... then it's all way too subjective. One might be completely into Asians, the other would rather remain single than to date an Asian. One doesn't settle for less than Gandalf, the other wants your chin to be free of any hairs.

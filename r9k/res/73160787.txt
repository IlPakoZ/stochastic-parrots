Deeply frustrating. Like, I like trans girls, and separately, I like femboys. They scratch different itches. Hot trans girls like 60 to 100 percent pass. Femboys do not and should not. I'm looking for a faggy, effeminate *man*.

Maybe it would be more effective if you went out and killed those trannies anon!! It would be more effective to eradicate them so they stop bothering femboy enjoyers!!

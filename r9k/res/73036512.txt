tfw no lonely robot bf
<comment>
i wish i had a psychotic yandere bf who was obsessed with me and would rape me and would eventually end up killing me its kinda messed up desu
<comment>
okay its me your lonely robot bf. I'm 5' 2" and balding and i have a crooked nose, am missing teeth, and virtually no chin or jaw.
<comment>
i'm literally so bored in my apartment right now, how're you doing femanon?
<comment>
Well, I am here waiting. Only thing is i am 5'10" and 250lbs. at least I am white (I guess).
<comment>
why the fuck would he kill you? A yandere needs his second half like air. He'd protect you, pamper you, worship your body. And it wouldn't be rape, you'd just make love everyday whether or not you like it.

<comment>
i cant wait for us to share my sCAT feces fetish together i make such thick pungent logs. im sure you'll love swallowing them.
<comment>
That is a very cute and romantic dream!
Is it that you want to feel so desired that a man is willing to break all social norms and even your will to get you? Is it that you want to stop thinking, abandon decision-making and the responsibility that comes from it? Or is it pure masochism- you just want to be constricted, abused, oppressed?

y-you're making my heart flutter.
I will admit I'm pretty obsessive, but it takes a bit to take hold. I also fantasize about having complete control over my gf/wife, and love to ramble about my theories while you sit there dumbly and nod. I'm sure when I feel like it we'll have fun too lol
<comment>
the last bastion of hope for /r9k/ right here gents
<comment>
most sane/least toxic robot
<comment>
Because you're putting trust in your partner and becoming vulnerable with them.
yandere bfs cum only inside, with no protection. pregnancy is a great way to seal your relationship and make you entirely dependent on him.
i just wanna be forced to be his housewife onahole, listen to him ramble incoherently, be at the end of his cute violent impulses.
That is a cute and realistic fantasy! But if you're his housewife, he'll have to work alot, meaning you'll be alone a lot. Or should he work at home, like in IT, so you can be toghether all the time? Maybe he'll even make a special place for you under his desk.
And what volent impulses are your favourite? I think cutting and beating is disgusting, but i'd love to control her airflow and make her dumb and dizzy with a hand on her neck and another one on her face. And i'd love to kiss and bite her neck until it's covered in marks of ownership. Hair-grabbing is cute too.
Though i think our fantasies are different cause i want a girl as obsessed with me as i am with her, and i would love if she bit me back and got on top of me sometimes.
<comment>
fuck i forgot to tag
for the latter part of my post.
<comment>
its even more trusting to swallow my turds think of the danger the infection my rancid little retard turdwhore think of me squatting over your moron retard mouth and squeezing out a fat pungent log and you gape your nasty little whore mouth and swallow it down your eager retard gullet the turd slides and leaves a fecal smear all down your tongue and throat and i fart and shit and piss right in your little retard mouth
<comment>
why are you bots like this. why can't you be normal weird. why do you have to be weirder than weird. you're weird.
<comment>
shutup retard turdwhore shit swallower
<comment>
yandere is extremally based and wholesome and traditional. it's a revolt against modern degeneracy and promiscuity.
<comment>
holy shit please stop posting this cringe
<comment>
like in IT
that's my exact fantasy!! a really nerdy desperate computer nerd!
i actually really like cutting, but nothing too intense. things like wound fingering can be hot.
breath control is a favorite though, when he's not bruising my neck with his hands i'd like him to choke me with some kind of collar or rope. maybe while he's busy with work? bites too!! so good!! to be marked is proof that i'm all his!
Though i think our fantasies are different cause i want a girl as obsessed with me as i am with her, and i would love if she bit me back and got on top of me sometimes.
also very much into this but i like it to be with progression, once my heart and mind are truly all his i can't go for even one second without his love and attention.
<comment>
i shit and fart feces into your wounds you rub my shit into your wounds ooohh daddy shit shit fuck retard fuck shit oohh you say as you smear my turds and shit into your retard turdwhore wounds
<comment>

This board is like a zoo for psychologically unwell people, and so it's not really surprising they knowingly seek out relationships with other retards
<comment>
people with relationships cant be unwell moron. and nobody with a relationship or who has ever had one belongs on this board
this is a board by incels, for incels. simple as.

Scary... do you have any scars? That's what i'm afraid of. I wouldn't want to damage my property. 
breath control is a favorite though
Yeah, a hand on neck is so intimate, so controlling, and so dangerous. It's the best. Is your neck sensitive?
i'd like him to choke me with some kind of collar
Make it extra-tight so you can barely breathe? Interesting. Do you want it to be big, heavy and uncomortable? I think silky, minimalistic collars are better. Constrict without hurting. 
bites too!! so good!! to be marked is proof that i'm all his!
Would you be willing to get some tattoos for him? Like his initials in a heart. Of course, if you're not willing, he can use a knife at home...
It's nice to imagine brainwashing a girl until she's puppy-eyed, obsessed, hopelessly dependent on me for psychological and emotional needs. At this point i would even let her do groceries, having a part-time job etc., as i would be sure she'll always come back and being alone for some time will just make her realize how much she needs me to feel comfortable, to even function.
Do you like any other bondage? Like a posture collar and a corset to improve your posture. Or a gag under a mask while walking in a park, and your hands cuffed inside a hoodie with one pocket for 2 hands.
<comment>
do you have any scars?
i have some faded self inflicted on my thighs.
Is your neck sensitive?
my neck is sensitive, probably one of the most sensitive parts. as for collar i'd like something light and really cute, when i want him to choke me with the collar it'd be from him tugging it harshly.
i'm not one for tattoos but him doing it himself might be a different story? that sounds much more intimate, especially if he tries to calm me while i cry from the pain. cute cooing while he carves my skin...
being alone for some time will just make her realize how much she needs me to feel comfortable, to even function.
you get it! i crave that kind of dependency. 
Do you like any other bondage?
i've never put too much thought into casual outside bondage like those. i'd only really be interested if it was forced upon me and made him happy. i'd like to do things like that for his praise and pleasure.
<comment>

That's the issue. If i were to cut a girl, I would have to be really deliberate about where i cut. A heart-shaped scar sounds cute though.
my neck is sensitive, probably one of the most sensitive parts. 
necks are criminally underrated. 
i'm not one for tattoos but him doing it himself might be a different story?
Yes, that's a good idea. Maybe even break into a tattoo studio, strap you into the chair and make you scream whil i slowly carve my name above your groin.

I'd like to constrict a girl's movements to make her dependent on my help and having to trust me. Like, i don't even like the look of high heels, but i'd love to put them on a girl and see her stumble and have to walk arm-in-arm and support her. Same with cuffed hands and a gag. I wouldn't be sadistic during it, to the contrary, i'd be extra-sweet to give positive reinforcement.
<comment>
okay come live with me then I'll abuse you
<comment>
i cant fkn read this thread... these images chainstun me real bad. fuck, i see these imagines and i just lay down on my bed for like half an hour and instantly drift onto a daydream about it. i remember like a year ago, these imagines and also similar ones cause the same reaction, i was just in bed listening to love music. i cant live my life that way
fuck life, honestly. im going to close all my tabs and farm mounts
also saving these images again lel
<comment>
ahh, it's time for me to sleep but i love you, anon.
thanks for making my tummy flutter with butterflies... &lt;3
i hope i dream of all your cute ideas.
<comment>
Oh yes, dreams are just the oppressive, surreal setting perfect for yandere love. I often wish we had a way to connect people's minds during sleep. So i could invade and control even that part of her. Do there stuff i wouldn't dare do irl... 
Good night! It was nice talking to you. You awaken my dominant side.
Embrace your nature, don't run from it! Some people won't be satisfied with normal relationships. You NEED yandere love.
<comment>
It genuinely disgusts me that women like this shit, my craziest ex would go around (pre breakup) jovially saying that I was abusive as if she was bragging.
<comment>
To the contrary, it's good that fembots are open about their fantasies and preferences. It gives more power to you- are you evil and abusive? Or will you control them for their own good and help them improve?
<comment>
I realized I romanticize yanderes in my head because I'm extremely insecure. I don't trust anyone and I can't love anyone because of this. However there is the tiny hope if someone forced themselves on me I could believe in it eventually (maybe). She needs to be extremely proactive too because I'm passive to the point I'm just existing. Even if this kind of unicorn woman exist in real life they have much better options than me.
<comment>
I wish yandere love (both ways) was normalized. I think it's an antidote for liberal conceptions of of liberty, self-acualization, consent and the individual. Happy yandere couples prove you can live without all that~

Ahh yes, weaponization of psychology against political opponents is a part of liberalism too
<comment>
I want this but i want cute guy to do it. Yaoi has corrupted my soul
<comment>
you mean you're gay? well, getting a bf should be very easy for you, but gays are famous for their promiscuity and triple digit body counts. tough luck
<comment>
i miss him anons pic rel
because i might get pregnant and die anon
<comment>
shoutout to all cuties in this thread
<comment>
pregnancy and yandere go hand-in-hand, since it ties you toghether for a long time, makes you weak and dependent on him, and gives him a social and moral responsibility to protect you and take care of you
<comment>
i know this is cringy but ghjghh please i need a bf like this so bad, i wanna be someones property basically and just have true, intense mutual obsession :( im never gonna find it...
<comment>
can someone post the jpg of the nazi loving black girl who gets beat up and realizes her fetish was stupid?
<comment>
There are millions of yandere men who want to obsess over a girl just like you! I think a lot of people are tired of casual, normie relationships. And yes, true love always looks cringy from the outside, but when you're in love, you're looking at him through rose-tinted glasses so you welcom even his abuse. 
Are there any particular fantasies you have?
<comment>
but they leave and cheat all the time
<comment>
Yanderes don't cheat by definition! If i ever get a gf, i'll make sure to never masturbate, never watch porn, never fantasize about anyone but her! I will warp my sexuality to be only attracted to her.
and well, of course if i want sex i'll just do it with her duuh

Are tattoos a sign of mental illness? Regardless of whether it's a man or a woman. A family member of mine (zoomer) recently started getting one small tattoo and then after only a few months, they have an entire sleeve. They are the first in our family to ever get tattoos, but they grew up without a father basically. Every time I see a man or woman with tattoos, I cannot take them seriously and they remind me that they're inferior
That's a very hot tranny.
I think tattoos can be cool but depends on the specific ones people get. Some obviously suck.
generally proclivity for tats scale with low impulse control. 
The concept of 'tasteful tats' is basically just buzzword terminology for tattoos of things 'I' deem respectable/important vs tattoos of things I don't. I have a friend with metal band related tats who uses this term often, yet obv a great many deal of people would look at his tats and similarly call them 'non tasteful.'
It's your body do what you want with it.
Its mutilation of your skin. basically circumcision tranny tier bullshit
It's self harm and tattoos have never improved the look of any human
We need to go back to the days when people got tattoos that had some special significance and didn't just use their flesh as a canvas. Sailors getting an anchor tattooed on their bicep is a lot different than pic.
I think it's highly correlated with poor impulse control, lack of self control, being lower class, and low intelligence. That's in general though. To be completely honest I see it as a redflag even though I've played with the idea of getting a tattoo or two before.
Im a guy Im probably going to get the top half of my back tatted with something that means a lot to me if I get to where I need to be by 25
I think its a desire to be unique or special, which means theyre insecure and think or know that theyre neither of those things
Same with lots of piercings or dyed hair
Both are signals to avoid

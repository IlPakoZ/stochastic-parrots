go get taco bell with mobile app
Take a large dose of tramadol
Realize wrong order 
Go back wait another 30 min in line, getting angry
Calmly explain they gave the wrong order
They ask for receipt show them the emailed receipt
Says it's not a receipt and won't make my order 
Consciousness shifts and become irate , say to call the cops because I'm not moving
Eventually they remake but I know it's spat in so I throw it out and cry my eyes out, whaling
I just wanted a comfy start to my weekend, I rarely get fast food anymore let alone taco bell because they're usually not open after I get out of work or are only serving breakfast , but I had a half day today and was looking forward to it since yesterday
I hate this, taco bell is sitting there in my trash but I can't eat it. At least I got my Baja freeze
Worst part is since they remade it , I can't try to do a charge back or rather I could but I'm not lying to my credit card company
<comment>
That's why you ask for extra spit and cum, so they don't give you either just to spite you.

you should have gone to checkers and gotten the funnel cake fries
shit it unbelieveably good
also works
<comment>
Opiate rage is an annoying beast, don't understand the mechanism that can make you so comfy and so angry simultaneously
<comment>
Funnel cake fries ?!?? Why can't I have a checkiers near me. Although what I really want is a Sheetz or Wawa.
Hell anyplace open 24/7 with good eats would be nice. Working nights sucks when it comes to shopping and restaurants since COVID
<comment>
one of the greatest moments in my life was when i was walking home nearly dead drunk and someone in their car offered me a single funnel cake fry
shit tasted like a window to heaven

Think I'll microdose acid again today, did it last weekend and it made me wildly productive. I think because when I was sitting still all I could think about was all of the jobs I have around the house and garden. Also will hopefully keep my mind off of opiates and benzos for most of the day.

be 20
drink 15 shots in a night, stay up until 7am, eat nothing
no hangover
be 21
drink four fucking tallboys in an entire night, eat salty food and carbs
wake up dead
why does turning 21 destroy your hangover capacity
<comment>
It does for some, it's a dice roll. But serious pain not really, deals more with aches and the like
<comment>
it does, partially an effect of distraction though
<comment>
Gunna eat 6g of shrooms and ma y shots of alcohol
<comment>
Honestly, I think the hangover thing is a myth. It's just a lot of people don't take care of their body and as you get older you're body can't handle how bad you are to it.
Also easy cure for a hangover, drink more or drink enough you wake up still drunk.

A few days ago I did crack cocaine again after almost a year and a half of having tried it on at least three occasions.
zero euphoria or elevation of my mood, I just felt a shock bombing in my head while my throat closed due to the instant increase in blood pressure and heart rate, I literally couldn't utter a single word. 
Fuck with those who say that it is a powerful drug, I never got psychological dependence on it and I can try it on the occasion that it occurs without walking around the street desperately trying to see how to get the next dose.

<comment>
mg of thc is far from the only factor in how strong edibles are, i ate 100 mg of live rosin gummies once and couldn't breathe when they hit and passed out and couldn't move for minutes when i woke up (i was in public too lmao :&lt; ) and threw up but i've also had 100mg drinks that i could have more than one of at a time and smoke+vape at the same time and never get uncomfortably high so unless it's the same type of edible and same brand you probably just found something that's weaker in practice
<comment>
It was a 40mg of thc oil capsule vs 20mg of gummy edibles
<comment>
when you drop the vape pen and have to go through the Seven Trials of Herecules to get it back
<comment>
Overall I'd say you'll be okay with the whole bar. In my experience the chocolate bars are way weaker than mushrooms straight up. Regular mushrooms I'd tell you to take 2g-3g for a decent first go. 
The never done drugs before makes me think that maybe some people can't handle their shit like if you ever heard that 911 call of that cop that ate edibles lol. 
But okay minor tips I'd say take the mushrooms on an empty stomach. Have some TV ready to go, I'm finding long running sitcoms good (keep the environment the same) vs documentary (too much in the real world). If things start to go wrong, make your world smaller like just watch the TV. 
I'm kind of an anti phone guy on shrooms like fuck that live in it while it's going on. 
Just be cool, wear comfy clothes and maybe have a blanket around you could get cold or hot or have to go to the toilet or throw up (empty stomach idea). 
Really I think my advice is more for high dose but you never know how much it'll hit you as an individual. I say have a blanket ready because you'll be so lazy it'll be a real adventure to get one later but could be fun. But really you are better preparing, have food around but don't use the oven for a frozen pizza you might forget about it kind of thing. 
I'm rambling a bit but get excited for others trying mushrooms.

Are Tequila and Vodka pretty much the same thing? Which one should I drink to get more drunk/drunk faster with less hang over?
<comment>
for me straight vodka is the best to avoid hangovers. Beer always fucks me up the next day. 
Just remember to hydrate regardless of what you do end up drinking.
<comment>
ok if you want to synthesize it then you should absolutely do that
I just know my brother wanted to synthesize DMT but was too lazy to in the end lol (ironic me calling someone else lazy)

thc oil capsules might not contain terpenes meaning you'd miss out on a lot of the effects of actually, like, smoking flower, or certain other kinds of edibles, etc.

My hangovers haven't noticeably changed from 18 to 22. Initially I thought they were but it turns out I just eat like shit now. Before I go to bed after drinking I always stay awake for at least 20 minutes and do the following:
eat a snack
drink at least 500ml of water, preferably powerade or hydralyte (godsend)
brush my teeth
as soon as I wake up, I drink some water and if drinking heavily the night before take one gravol. As soon as I start vomiting its OVER for a couple of hours. The headache/general shitty feeling sucks, but I HATE vomiting deeply.

Blocked my toilet last night and kept forgetting to be plunger before j need, ordered on Amazon should come today.
Woke up today and for the first time i forever I'm withdrawing from opioids so of course I need to take a monster shit.
God, now my toilet has no water in it and just a giant shit that when I finally get the plunger is going to be there

just fill the back tank manually.
lift the lid off the toilet, pour water into a cup then dump the cup in the back until you've filled enough water to clear your shit

Drugs are cool kids , of you're like I was reading this thread debating on if to start..just do it. Drugs have calmed my autistic mind to an insane degree, sure having to take the drug or experience withdrawals sucks but the same is for ssris and things like ritlian . The only thing bad about drugs is that society said they are bad and made them illegal.
Because if people are contact with some white powder, they won't go buy all the toys

Will people be aggressive with you just for being very drugged up in public? Yesterday a dude I think was yelling at me when I was fucked off my face on dope. Had some stimulants too so I wasn't nodding, just prone to really obvious opiate eyes. The lids get drooped like I have eyelid folds, and around my eyes go pretty dark. Strange because another called me an asshole days before. Both these occasions I was just walking around minding my own business.
<comment>
Naturally have opiate eyes
Also autistic
The amount of times people mistake me for a druggie instead of an autistic is amazing, granted I now am a druggie also but before now it happened.
For you, if people are confronting you, you either love somewhere bad or are doing some serious fucked up shit. Most people don't want to get involved with others

Is there tolerance/withdrawal cross over between

Basically I'm wondering if I can rotate all of these "GABA" type drugs or they have tolerance with each other

2 grams of phenibut every 2 weeks or so as a substitute for alcohol when i feel like talking
like a bazillion grams of weed when the peak hits
it ain't much but it works, simple as
<comment>
tolerance
possibly/probably
withdrawal
definitely between phen, alc, and benzos
pregablin is a niche case because it doesn't actually bind to gaba but affects an enzyme that leads to more gaba synthesis, so somewhat yes
<comment>
take pregablin as substitute for alcohol
end up craving alcohol anyway because gaba addiction propensity
drink 4 beers and almost become unconscious because crosspotentiation

Out of all the available methods of weed consumption I've found dry herb vaping to be the superior option
Efficient 
Good high
Smell doesn't linger
Can control temp for level of high vs terp enjoyment
Only real issue I see is that it's a higher cost of entry then joints.
<comment>
Is it safe to mix phenibut and kratom? Anyone tried that? I'm thinking about taking maybe 1-2g of kratom tonight, that would probably be enough to see how it interacts. I've had 5.5g of phenibut, I don't feel aggressively high or anything. I'm definitely feeling the stimulant effect with slight vision impairment. It feels similar to being drunk off 6 beers but without feeling stupid.
<comment>
I've never grown shrroms but I think you can legiterally just google magic mushroom spores and find cheap vendors. The spores themselves are technically legal so you can just check reddit or whatever forums pop up.
<comment>
Can control temp for level of high vs terp enjoyment
Since I'm obviously new to using these things, what's the difference in temperatures? I figured it was just how blasted you get on the first hit, but I read things like "terp enjoyment" or "convection vs regular high" and I don't really know what changes.
<comment>
The basics of it:
Some of the better quality vapes let you adjust the temperature. Either in set intervals or granularity by a degree at a time (Though these are usually only reserved for the higher end units). Weed officially combusts at around 450 degree F. So all vapes tend to max out around 420-430 degrees. The higher the temp, the more THC is evaporated and consumed, however: THC isn't the only component to weed. Terpenes are olfactory compounds in the plant that effect the taste and smell of the herb, but each terp (depending on what it is) has a max temp that it's best enjoyed at, where any higher will destroy it. So it really depends on what you're after in terms of consuming your herb.
tl;dr
higher temp = more stoned, but more acrid or "Burnt" tasting weed.

I know some Inuit in Surrey BC 
Party gods 
And they make me grateful, so grateful to be alive, and they amaze me in ways that ever more has me believing in our future.
They are completely different in warm areas. A people of such a profoundly unique soul.
Everything about them is unique.
The most unimaginable autism of the most lost universes. 
And they are THRIVING.
It makes me wonder what they were before other tribes pushed them north

Surrey is officially an Inuit etc area.
So many of the lost far northern tribes have the warm land they have always seeked. . . in Surrey.
I bless their prospering utopia and independence.
The Canadian soul always thrives with indigenous soul and indigenous autism. There is infinite lost indigenous tribes that are being reborn. Infinite lost timelines making new stands.

Whilst it does come down to luck, yes, people have come up with whether to fold, raise or check on every card combination based off what your opponents are doing like a complete formula to win. In high level competitions it's about knowing this formula and then just bluffing out of your ass when you have to to win large sums plus experience level.
<comment>
Tho, I have heard that shrooms have grown across Europe forever. I wonder what history to believe. 
Because it does seem as if the history of Europe and shrooms was destroyed.
If it is true that Europe always has had shrooms, then I wish for that timeline to re-emerge.

If you walked down the street and found a ridiculous amount of shrooms growing, how many would you eat?
<comment>
None until I properly characterized, cleaned, and dehydrated them. I would then probably take 1.5-2 gram equivalents to the typical cubensis on a good occasion.
<comment>
Yeah, true but I think they used herbs and '''plant medicines''' more often than recreational drugs. I think these things were used more as medication and for religious ceremonies than for recreational use. The rather flippant relationship we have with drugs in the western world would be foreign to most cultures. It would be weird to do heroic doses of anything. The relationship we have with drugs is not good, even though a lot of normalfags and addicts think it's healthy to do massive amounts of psychs and turn yourself schizo.
None, because I don't want to accidently eat a deathcap and die painfully. Sometimes poisonous mold can grow on shrooms too.

It doesn't. You shouldn't gamble while impaired. Your good luck will eventually come back down and you will be at a disadvantage because your thinking will be slowed.

characterized
they bruise blue when touched
cleaned
they are growing in the ground, there is nothing to be cleaned, they are in perfect condition
dehydrated
the point is i dont have a dehydrator or scale
 1.5-2 gram equivalents to the typical cubensis
I will probably let 90% of them rot and microdose like you.
I ate a dose from this spot last week. I came back today and there are 10 more doses about to rot because I am afraid.
I feel like I am about to turn down a potentially life changing experience.

But I didn't jump straight to 30mg, and that was smart by me. I started at 10mg, then went to 15mg, then one night did a 15mg and then another 15mg about 90 minutes later, so it was 30mg but spaced out, and it felt fine, so I jumped into the 30mg in one hit and it's perfect for me.
I have a pretty low tolerance, I'm only an occasional weed user

Recommend me a stim different than molly and alpha. I run out of molly and I don't like alpha cause I keep redosing it like a tard. When I did mephedrone I stopped at 200mg cause I felt good. With molly I don't need to go above 150mg cause of lmao serotonin. Meanwhile alpha is so purely dopamine-centric drug that I never feel satisfied on it cause it doesn't give me serotonin I so crave. Should I just try speed or coke or what else for that stim itch (never tried actual speed nor coke ever so idk).

some random lady I met outside this morning I asked for a snout but she handed me half a joint lmao.
love Scotland.
love getting stoned and playing random neo geo japanese games (FB Neo) I literally have no idea what the game is or really how to play it. it's all in japanese.
fucking hilarious i tell you hwat
<comment>
If you're completely new to weed, go from 10mg - 20mg - 30mg. Don't start at 30 unless you already have experiences getting high.
<comment>
I don't want to work, I got a weeks vacation saved up. Debating on using it. Also once again I'm going to be working the holidays, missed thanks giving and Christmas, mom was in hospital for Easter so we didn't celebrate and I'll be working July 4th
Fucking hell, also pretty much have all debts paid now besides back taxes (20k, 300/month).
Damn I just want to relax and sleep and drug out

Is opioids and peheniebutt safe?
<comment>
So I took half a capsule of pregabalin, roughly 150mg. Bit of a weird feeling, got quite shaky for a bit but had some lunch and a sugary drink and felt better. I suppose I'm a bit less anxious, I'm at work and one of my employees has another job offer and might be leaving, and have been able to navigate meetings with him and my boss without issue. Took it about 10am and it's 2.30 now, when should I take the other half to remain functional but have fun?
Probably shouldn't experience with new drugs at work but I am invincible and incredible.

Man, I tried two weeks ago LSD for the 5th time ever but this time i took a big dose (200microns).
Damn, I was with a few pals at a friend's house and we spent all night staring at the chinese imperial flag (pic related) and went into deep philosophical questions.
I loved it.
Although I couldn't use that much acid regularly (most of my trips were outdoor hiking).

Well, sometimes it's a change of pace. Of course it doesn't work if you're not that bright to start with.
Also is there any drug to stop being lonely ?
Friends.
Just dry them and smoke them.
<comment>
Kek no, I sit at a computer all day fixing people's network problems. I've done it drunk, coked up, on ketamine, benzos, opiates. I'm good at it. 
Darkweb mate, 15 quid for 15 capsules. I do have achey muscles from working in the garden over the weekend, and they're much less noticeable. Also been pissing like mad and drinking loads of water, more chatty and having fun. 
Took the other half about half an hour ago, hope I can drive home ok

bump for pregablin
<comment>
How does pregabalin compare to phenibut?
<comment>
I am the pregagoblin. So took about 150mg this morning, another 150 this afternoon and around 100 this evening. And a couple of beers, feeling pretty cool. 
It's a more noticeable and wobbly high. I can be balls deep in phenibut and function normally, drive around, have conversations
Prega is comfy in low doses and as you move up is like being drunk in the body and not the brain, and all your body feels nice and relaxed. It's going to be hard to leave this and only do it once a week.
<comment>
Haven't drink in two weeks.
Getting smashed from 400ML of vodka.
Absolutely worth the maddening wait.
<comment>
I haven't touched alcohol for a year now, all about that
<comment>
im literally the opposite. for me, weed makes all my physical sensations feel deeper and longer lasting, so even something like eating a little too much will make me feel like garbage. especially in things with high cbd content.

you mean so head could launch on HITLER'S BIRTHDAY?

as someone who works on computer networks do you think ordering from the Darkweb is safe?
<comment>
caffeine-makes me feel jittery and weird, and doesn't improve my focus at all, gives me a slight headache
tobacco-absolutely hate smoking, and when I did I barely felt anything, gives me a slight headache
weed-it can be a little interesting but I really don't like how it dumbs me down and I usually regret taking it while still high
cocaine- recently had the opportunity to try for the first time, actually kinda liked it, but it was still a bit underwhelming compared to what I read about it and makes me feel weird the day after. Likely won't be taking much more of that
What drug should I try next in Minecraft? I was thinking meth/speed since I have ADHD and Kennedy used it?
<comment>
Why does phenibut make everything smell and taste weird and gross? I've noticed DXM does that too, are drugs that effect neurotransmitters directly more likely to do this? I'd like to be able to eat but everything tastes fucking disgusting.
<comment>
DXM makes things taste more bland to me.
<comment>
meth kicks ass as long as nobody gets mad about you tweaking. you can be so productive/pseudoproductive and have absurd amounts of focus and energy and there's a euphoria to it too
<comment>
I've recently gotten in to my local illegal rave scene and want to take MDMA, but the both the internet and the people I know are giving wildly different results on how much is a decent effective dose, the (((definitely-not-government-funded))) websites on the matter are saying to take very very very small amounts or I'll instantly die of dehydration, and I'm hearing other ravers say crazy shit like half a gram, so I'd like to get the opinions of some robots who aren't funded or retards.
<comment>
i did like ten lines in a weekend once and turned out fine and had a good time
<comment>
I find it odd that caffeine gives you a headache and makes you feel weird but cocaine doesn't. You might have been overdoing it with the caffeine. You also might have had shitty cocaine. I haven't tried any speedy drugs personally. 
I have ADHD and have found that weed was really good for slowing down my thoughts and relieving anxiety, it only makes me stupid when I take too much but I have no self control when it comes to edibles and always want to eat upwards of 500mg in a night so it ends up being a net negative and pulling me into a 2 week long binge. Kratom is your best bet for replacing that, some people complain that it doesn't do much for them because they don't take enough. You need to find the correct dosage before writing it off.
On a more practical level, it's a bad idea to try to self medicate with drugs for ADHD. I'd recommend trying herbal teas for anxiety, adding more pro and pre biotics to your diet, taking b vitamins and/or eating beef and/or fish daily and taking magnesium. I was taking fish oil capsules that seemed to help but apparently that's not particularly effective so I'm about to switch to high quality chia seed oil to see if that works. It seems like a lot of money to spend on supplements and vitamins but you'd be spending way more in the long run on drugs and they won't be as effective. You don't have to spend money on a bunch of bullshit nootropics or anything, just make sure you're getting omega 3 and the essential vitamins you need for brain function. Though lions mane works very well for me so I'd recommend that one. If you did any one of these things in isolation you'd notice an effect but if you do all of them together, it's life changing. You feel like a completely different person.
<comment>
Do you know if it's safe with opis? I can't find any information on interactions, I guess I can be the first to report but would rather not.
Also describe pheniebutt high plz
<comment>
Kratom start with very high doses , nic salts
<comment>
Speaking about taste, ketamine and really good stir fry is amazing.
Ketamine with steak and potatoes is godly
Ketamine and pizza is sadly gross, anything with tomatoes for some reason just tastes so horrid
<comment>
https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenibut
Don't mix with opis 
It can be deadly addictive like benzos so only take 1x a week 
Takes a while to kick in I usally just get horny before I actually feel the high but it just feels like your having a comfy day, I haven't had it on its own I usally just mix with weed I herd it synergizes well however I don't know how much
<comment>
Practice harm reduction, just like with anything start small and see how it effects you. Everyone's metabolism is different. If it's not enough for you, you can always up the dosage next time just make sure to do it gradually. It all depends on if you want to get fucked up or if you want to just socialize and get into the music. 
I've never taken MDMA but people microdose it all the time and say it's great so it's not like you're missing out if you don't get blasted off it.
What about with kratom? I asked earlier in the thread but it got buried.
<comment>
No idea but you should read
psychonautwiki
https://trippywiki.com/substances/ 
and reddit for information 
just google Kratom psychonaut and you can find loads of information
<comment>
Alright, thanks. I do use psychonaut wiki but sometimes there's too much info to parse through or not enough info to get anything valuable from it. It's a useful tool to have regardless. I guess lurking reddit is the way to go most of the time.

i took 600mg pregabalin and 10mg diazaepam, should i take more pregabalin or would it not make any difference?
i'm also drunk and stoned

You're already high on 4 substances, I don't think adding any more of anything is a good idea.

Mistakes were made def gonna smoke but holy shit my stomach hurts

Mdma makes me too sleepy i cant enjoy the high, what do?
<comment>
I've been sober for almost 24 hours
<comment>
But howlong have you been hung over?
<comment>
18 days for me. Needed a break after a 10 day opiate, benzo and pregabalin binge (was mixing all three). Relapsing when my codeine arrives on Wednesday.
<comment>
I can't tell because I don't really remember how it feels to not be hungover or high
<comment>
Get a regent test kit
<comment>
That's when you know you need to get sober and for a significant amount of time.
<comment>
What country are you in? Burgerland probably sucks but where I am the cops couldn't give a shit about people buying for personal.
<comment>
how many days in a row can I have edibles before it fucks me over?
from experience that's probably MDA and not MDMA. MDMA doesn't make me sleepy but MDA does, and it's extra fucked because marquis test kits aren't capable of distinguishing between the two of them.
<comment>
"safe" doses of MDMA are very contested in the current literature, but it is confirmed to be at least somewhat neurotoxic, especially with re-dosing/repeated use and high doses (200mg+ is usually considered "unsafe"). the most common safety standard you'll see in this thread is a maximum dose of 180mg, once every 3 months. can't find any literature supporting this specific dosage, but i have not seriously looked into this in a very long time. i do know however, that the national institutes of health claims MDMA is psychologically and physically safe in doses of 100mg. and MDMA therapy usually doses people with 50-100mg once every 3-5 weeks. if you want to ride entirely on the safe side, just take 100mg and then wait a month or two. if its good M, 100mg will be plenty to experience what its all about. but god damn, does the euphoria get unbelievable when you start taking 300mg+ but i don't know that its worth the potential damage.
personally i was taking stupid amounts, like 400-600mg throughout the night. wouldn't take more than 300mg at once. i can't say for sure it didn't give me serotonin syndrome and/or make me retarded. this might sound weird, but i really just don't remember what it was like before (i was 14 when i started my polydrug use, the first illicit substance i ever took being methamphetamine cut MDMA) however i don't think it really gave me any permanent damage. it really is a person to person thing though. part of MDMA's neurotoxicity actually comes from its metabolization into MDA near the tail end of the roll, which is supposedly a more neurotoxic chemical. meaning if depending on your specific amalgamation of enzymes, varying amounts of MDA can be metabolized resulting in different reactions to the substance psychologically. 
basically just take 100-150mg. you can go higher if you don't care so much about safety. takin 200mg once probably isn't gonna ruin your head, but making a habit out of it easily can. don't pop flats or presses
<comment>
couldn't get acid in time for bike day. settling for allylescaline instead, potentially with some MDMA.
haven't tripped in a while, kind of excited. 
what is everyone's bike day plans?
<comment>
Seems to be just for respiratory depression, so should be fine with o-dsmt which is an opi
<comment>
Don't have any acid but I may try some Al-LAD 
I should really try and find a public event or something for next year
<comment>
Honestly why risk it? Opitards are so stupid they'll wonder why they OD 'ed then do stupid shit like this
<comment>
damn, been wanting to try AL-LAD forever. missed my chance to get it years ago and just been waiting for an RC site to sell it at not a retarded price. other than faglogix which requires way too much shit to get approved to buy from them.
<comment>
the three month rule is just a random number that Shulgin tossed out without any specific data to back it up.
Serotonin receptors downregulate after using MDMA and generally return to baseline after 21 days, according to the most recent research. You don't really "run out" of serotonin after using it, your brain just becomes less sensitive to it. MAPS uses this as a base on their experimental treatments, spacing them around 3-5 weeks.
As far as neurotoxicity goes, it apparently primarily applies in the form of oxidation of these same receptors. The issue here is that the research related to neurotoxicity is pretty old and the methodology was kinda nuts, using something like 50 times the usual dose on primates and keeping their environment hot to exacerbate the effects. Human brains may be more sensitive to the drug than other primates are, but it's still ridiculous to overdose to that degree. Also sometimes they actually just gave them meth instead of MDMA so lol
The overall consensus nowadays is that MDMA can indeed affect neural pathways, the "damage" dealt being proportional to dosage and also importantly to temperature. Keeping cool helps a lot, going over 120mg(or 120mg + 80mg) is unnecessary due to the body's limits on actually metabolizing the substance.
I put "damage" between quotes because although we know for sure that it can cause alterations in neural pathways, we don't know if these are actually negative. We can infer(but not be sure) that these changes would cause alterations in mood and cognitive thinking. Research done on people that abused MDMA have shown that they do score lower on related tests than control groups, but these usually don't bother checking if the MDMA group have used other drugs that can impair cognitive ability, like meth or cannabis(in high doses). 
In a research conducted on an mormon community where MDMA(and only MDMA) is legal, they found no difference on those tests.

oh i had that video saved to watch at some point. found it in my brief research to make sure i wasn't parroting blatantly wrong info, very interesting stuff. its been a couple of years since i did any serious research on the modern consensus on MDMA safety but this info sort of sparks my interest in it again. good stuff anon

never heard of that one til now. guess i'll pull the trigger and order some 1cP-AL-LAD. thanks anon
<comment>
no clue
i ate a low-medium amount a few hours before bed for 5 days in a row and was fine but that's probably not much compared to other users
<comment>
MDMA is my favorite drug by a decent margin so I want to make sure I'm enjoying it properly. It's way better when you're rolling and you don't have that nagging feeling in the back of your head telling you you're rotting your brain out.
Placebo is a pain. Last night I had an edible instead of rolling and at the end of the night I felt a bit depressed. I'm pretty sure if I rolled I'd attribute that to the MDMA and got paranoid about it all week.
<comment>
feel the same way, haven't rolled in a long time so i fell out of keeping up with studies on MDxx compounds, but i really do love MDMA and MDA. i just bought some because i saw someone discussing MDMA neurotoxicity a couple threads ago, they mentioned the whole Mormon study too. made me feel better about taking it again but i realized its been so long that a 150mg roll can't hurt. stopped taking it because when i first got into it in early high school, i was taking 600mg every friday night and thought i fucked up my head so i thought i'd stop pushing my luck with it and just take something else that has more researched psychological effects. even killed a gram in a weekend a couple times. i do feel quite a bit better now about rolling, and i didn't know much about the body's limit on metabolizing it to be honest until now (had heard about it but wrote it off because the difference between 150mg and 300mg felt so ungodly better when i was using) but researching it now it would've changed the way i dosed back then. although i was doing meth at first, but quickly got into sourcing clean MDMA online and had the same dosing habits. even more hyped to be rolling again now.

Anyone taken drugs from the US to Canada across a border crossing before? I want to take acid and shrooms across the border in a car, how often do they do full searches if you're generally compliant?
<comment>
not very often. go when its super busy, its not easily predictable but obviously the later at night or earlier in the morning there will be less people. you can google peak hours to "avoid traffic", its some like 7am-9am and 4pm-7pm are the busiest during the weekday. if it can be helped of course. i know it might not fit in your schedule.
my buddy once got MDMA on a plane by putting it in a pendant on the end of his necklace. it was like a clear little container that is supposed to have a crystal in it, but he just swapped it for a rock of molly

just checked the site, they have moxy, i am vibrating at high speed, do they ship to usa?
<comment>
their moxy is unbelievably overpriced. indole used to have that shit for 45 CAD for 250mg before they died
but yeah they ship to US
<comment>
listen, ive had 3 seizures from smokey and rare and now they're both dead so basically if im even going to get the product at all i consider it cheap at this point 
I also have real mdma rocks anyway so this is basically just me having polydrug curiosity and not an actual fiending need
If you have another cheaper source for it (plus maybe 6-apb) that ships to usa then feel free to post it
<comment>
I have a reagent set and TLC tests to see the ingredients. It was pure MDMA with no adulterants, def no MDA. I have had this with other batches of pure crystal also
<comment>
THCA is literally uncooked thc
<comment>
i was just complaining. i know its a sort of take what you can get thing if you're US based. chemlogix ships to US but doesnt have it in stock right now, but when they do its like 50 cad for 250mg. problem is getting approved to even order, they require you to send a real research paper you're credited on + ID and a full explanation on the research you will conduct with the product. microdelics used to have it for cheaper too and they ship internationally. worth checking out if you wanna be patient but i get its probably unbelievably annoying to get RCs in america.
although despite its fucked price on CV, it coming in pellets is rather convenient and a cool novelty.

Whats the best stim out there?
<comment>
Well there's obviously potential issues, but generally yes. As long as you order domestically and don't try and import from other countries, and buy from trusted vendors that are confirmed to have good stealth you're pretty much fine. I get my shit shipped to my work because my gf doesn't approve so doesn't need to know, and I've never had any issues. If you follow the good opsec guide on plebbit and only order personal use amounts the chances of you being caught are tiny.
<comment>
Hahaha that's a genius way of smuggling drugs. I've taken acid all over the place because I just stick it in a book and nobody can tell, otherwise I tend to stick to prescription pills in blister packs as nobody has ever investigated them and I can take whatever benzos or opiates I like. I really want to get some weed to France this summer but don't know a safe way to do it, maybe a lump of hash in some food or something. edibles I guess are much safer but I'd rather be able to smoke

Very hard to get Adderall in the UK, the stuff they sell on the darkweb markets seem to be selling junk that's mostly caffeine. You're better off getting modafinil, you don't get high on it but it makes you intensely focused on what you're doing, and keeps you alert and awake. 
Can be bought on darkweb or imported from other countries that it's legal in, there are some websites that do that, but I use markets 
Good luck little lad, you'll do alright

I like both. Just discovered prega, took quite a bit, drank a beer, smoked some weed and am now infinitely comfy. 
Yeah phen is worth getting, if you keep use to once a week and don't start using it on consecutive days, you build a dependence very fast. I've made that mistake a couple of times and it's brutal, didn't sleep for a week

you have 50 freaking days. study 30-60 minutes a day and you'll be fine, its not like biology is some crazy deep complex subject requiring genius intelligence. anyways adderall doesn't make you smart it makes you think you're smart.

Are people in this general actually doing heroin? How are you planning to manage withdrawal/quit?

We have no pharma tweaker pills in the UK, unless you're rich ritalin is unaffordable on the black market
Your options are nasty laced cocaine/speed powder or to get a friend with ADHD and ask for their ritalin

Use to have a prescription for Elvansr but I slammed them way to hard and had a psychosis.

Heroin is safer than alcohol

I have scripts for chronic pain that I use to tough out withdrawals and I don't plan on quitting any time soon
I don't shoot or anything like that at least

It depends. Alcohol makes my skin shit and my hair fall out and my poop smell like shit but dick works and hormones are somewhat somewhat acceptable.
Heroin does not of these things but makes my cum transparent and my dick more useless than a trannies one and I get gyno and are ultra low T on blood tests. Also getting off alcohol is hell but with baclofen/benzos managable heroin made me unable to feel joy in life for a loooooooong time as in absolutely unable not sad just as if nothing is fun. Sex, love, awesome food, nature, even your dog. Its bad but it will pass. Honestly fuck both of these doing pcp once in a while is more sustainable.

except colostrum, that shit is basically super soldier serum
Women are the light of the world. They are soft and kind people. They give tenderness and love to the men, open their intimate gateways for them, receive their semen and carry their babys. With endless patience they take care of their families, children, parents, husbands, brothers and friends. They endure violence and cruelty with silent tears and allways forgive and keep on serving and being helpful, even without appreciation. They cook and wash and clean, on their knees, and don't complain. They comfort men when they're in pain, giving their time and affection, and don't ask for reward. They make the world beutiful, with colors and flowers and their fond creativity. They sing and dance and enjoy life even in the hardest times.
Nope, they are judgemental and cold. Only kind not to offend.

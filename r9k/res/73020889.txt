AHHHHH WHY DID EVERY SENSORY IMPRESSION STOP BEING NOVEL AFTER I EXITED CHILDHOOD
i did mushrooms in the forest one time, it sent me right back there. felt like being an adult was one big fantasy and that i never left childhood. the world breathed around me and i saw how crazy the adult world was once again from the viewpoint of a child. the feeling really sticks with you months after the trip is over.
I occasionally have a similar experience if I smoke too much weed.
Lay down to sleep
Close eyes
Fragmented snippets of memories start flooding my mind
All from when I was a child
Only fleeting glimpses of seemingly random and non-connected thoughts
Maybe of a certain patterned doily at my nana's house
Then a memory of me looking inside my old green toy boat while in the bathtub
I'm never a fan of these moments because the nostalgia and whimsy of it make me want to remember back to the full memory and "Scene", but I can never grasp the memory long enough before the next fleeting image hits my mind's eye

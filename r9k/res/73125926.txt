This is not some mere fetish. It's a way of life to let my woman express herself with more well endowed men

To put his shoes on when he's done with her and go off to fuck the next white woman

black people are really weird about the light skin part of their feet, on their soles. Not joking. My sister is a coal burner (fat af of course) and told me they all refuse to take off their socks for sex because of it

How do you honestly square
loving a woman and wanting what is best for her and for her to be happy
and
damning her to a lifetime of your poor to mediocre cock and limited sexual abilities
What is wrong with allowing your partner to enjoy herself with other men if she still loves you, other than holdover Christian "values"

Her pleasure is my happiness

This is so creepy. Make white people stop.

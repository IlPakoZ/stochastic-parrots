anyone else feel saved by 2d women?
I think that if I never got into anime I probably would've just killed myself by now.
I used to be obsessed with roasties, then I saw the light.
2D women are intelligent, kind, loving, genuine.
They're rational, fun, adventurous.
They aren't whores only interested in sex and drugs and other degenerate shit.
I wish I was born in a time when women like this still existed in the real world, but oh well, at least I have the drawings and ideas.

need to play genshin
My guy this means you have serious problem if you can't stop playing vidya.
Let me tell you my story of this game.
It got released and I played it everyday (since day 1), 365 days logging in. When new region or character got released I wanted to pull more. Just to get every new character. Same went with weapons in that game. I was so in it, it was like addiction. When I didn't got what I wanted I was frustrated, angry. I started to swipe. Thousands went by like it was nothing. It was bad, I just could not stop. And game was dog shit (content is dry like desert), but it traps you. It traps you good, you need to grind/spend money to get characters good. But it is just illusioon.
So I got drunk other day and pressed uninstall button. Never again, I felt free and happier. It was hard, but I survived. So fren leave it before you become me. Stay away from Gacha games. They will ruin you.

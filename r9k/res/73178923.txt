Anyone else fucked with poor digestive system.

Yeah. I just dont eat anymore because the horrible stinky diarrhea shits, cramps and heartburn. I even tried eating just organic vegetables and nut milks but they still hurt my stomach and give me diarrhea. I just drink Gatorade now.

Yeah. Been trying to fix it by eating less processed foods and having probiotic food, but fast food is so yummy

<comment>

I lost a lot of weight in the last 2 years. Like 70lbs maybe. I take vitamins and minerals each day, but I feel like garbage. I try to eat fruit or oatmeal sometimes but I know it will give me diarrhea. My whole gut from my esophagus to my asshole is constantly irritated and inflamed and painful. I tried probiotics, fasting, organic only, veganism, food elimination, checking for allergies, h pylori tests etc. my gi tract is just fucked. Apparently my grandpas family had similar issues. We just have shitty guts and its genetic I guess .

Oh hi there. My digestive system is not that bad yet, but it's getting worse these past few years and I can't find te reason why yet. Doctors just don't care about it and I went to 6 different ones.

It sucks and its awful, I know. I really hope yours doesnt get as bad as mine.

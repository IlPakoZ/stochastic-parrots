why do people act like this dumb bitch isn't almost 30 and an extremely successful twitch streamer with so much disposable income?
she's a grown fucking adult. take some responsibility. 
why is it other people's responsibility to teach to get health insurance when your 28 and have the income to buy it. you're just retarded.

does women find this protrusion hot?
i assume so, but why are you acting like an in insecure teenage girl about it?
I find it disturbing. I am male btw.
only on my kpop boys
yes im a woman and i find it very sexy
i wanna know if my massive throat lump is a plus or a minus
as long as you're not jutting it out should be fine. its good when paired with a well kept beard and a strong jaw, otherwise if you even dress slightly feminine people will think you're a looney troon who got surgery in the neck to pass as a man
find this protrusion hot?
only on girls
beards
ew. shut up moid.
Yes, and they love to eat it
why do you have this saved in your computer? is this a fetish that i'm unaware of?
Yeah, unless you're super skinny and it's extremely prominent. Then it kinda freaks me out.
I think it's cute. I like to watch it move as they talk.
Not really, just like posting these comics every once in a while
I'd be willing to bet my pinky finger that these comics were drawn by a mentally ill Murican tranny.

i wanna know if my massive throat lump is a plus or a minus
<comment>
as long as you're not jutting it out should be fine. its good when paired with a well kept beard and a strong jaw, otherwise if you even dress slightly feminine people will think you're a looney troon who got surgery in the neck to pass as a man

why do you have this saved in your computer? is this a fetish that i'm unaware of?
<comment>
Yeah, unless you're super skinny and it's extremely prominent. Then it kinda freaks me out.
<comment>
I think it's cute. I like to watch it move as they talk.

Not really, just like posting these comics every once in a while

I'd be willing to bet my pinky finger that these comics were drawn by a mentally ill Murican tranny.

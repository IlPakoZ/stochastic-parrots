Bro I know this feel. It just happened to me too. I have to do like a ridiculous amount of intense heavy lifting and sprints to burn it off too

Your gut microbe composition is fucked. Leading to the eating sprees of stupid shit. You dont even need to cut just eat oatmeal with fruit, home pressed orange juice for breakfast, Rye bread with liver spread for lunch, and some pasta with tomato sauce for dinner.
You need your entire gut bacteria to change. Then it will be a lot easier to lose weight.
Simply trying to cut food with that fatty microbe population in your gut will always end in inevitable relapse.

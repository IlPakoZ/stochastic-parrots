Grow your hair out, incel. It's 2023 and women don't like your "short on the sides longer on top" fade haircut that's been out of fashion since 2012. It's the age of men with long hair.

Back in college I tried to see how long my hair would grow out and it stopped growing once it became a mullet that looked extremely dogshit

Ah shit I've been using that hairstyle for almost a decade now

How did you develop your intellect? I have always found this quite puzzling, I am quite mystified as to how there are so many people seemingly who at least seem on the outset to be quite good at thinking logically and critically. 
I have thought that it must have something to do with social standing and one's background that they come from, or it is a treat they are taught as children or maybe it's a difference in the school they attended growing up. 
I was not that good at thinking, mainly there was a lot of difficult problems I would encounter growing up and it caused neurosis for me mentally because I did not know how to solve them until I learned what critical thinking and objectivity was. It seems like until you learn this you are not given the tools to think very well.

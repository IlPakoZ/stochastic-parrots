Do you often fantasize about getting into severe fistfights, /r9k/?
<comment>
Sometimes which is why I train for it
<comment>
Feign the left leg kick, kick em in the head with the right
Im good at sports because i keep my mind straight, this is very rare even amongst pros
<comment>
I have never been one to fight since my weak physique does not allow it and I would be knocked down easily, but that does not mean that I have not learned dirty tricks, such as throwing sand into the eyes, biting their ears until they are ripped off, hanging on their backs and hold them tight until they drop to the floor, even better if they are wearing earrings or some type of perforation to focus on them and brutally rip them off until they are sore. If one day I have to face someone stronger than me, I already have my options on the table to face it.

I got the gnarliest knuckles of anyone I know. But they're just for show, I don't really smash anyone in the face ever.
<comment>
only occasionally, not that I really want to be in one though
I think if you make it through grade school and your early-mid 20s without being in a real fist fight, it's likely that you won't have to be in 1 in your future
<comment>
No. Mainly because Im a girl. I once went to a punk rock concert and they all started kicking and throwing punches. I didnt manage to leave before it got really dangerous so I had my brow cut open from a punch and had to get stitches. 
If I were a guy, absolutely, yes.
<comment>
everyday, everywhere I am I have a day dream or two about what would happen if I had to kick the christ out of someone. whether they work there or not, I always think about just absolutely bloodying someone, even when driving.
I was at my grandma's funeral (not many folks showed up) and I imagined absolutely wrecking the big blad male nurse who was her EOL caretaker, and when he's down and bloodied throwing him in the hole before dropping me-maw's casket on top of him.
Do I have a problem?

Being female is no excuse for weakness, you weak fucking degenerate.
<comment>
No, you have testosterone.
<comment>
Perhaps but you could join a gym and kill people for money instead. Most fighters are freaks anyway
<comment>
I literally got my shit kicked in by some 6'3 dude and I'm 5'10.
<comment>
I'm also a girl and I constantly think about fighting. Either myself or other people I know..... but I'm mentally ill
<comment>
I mean sure, its not, but I would still stand no chance against a guy so thats a bummer 
I fantasize about smashing peoples head like pumpkins, but in those kind of fantasies Im always imagining myself as a guy. Im reading this cool western book right now and would kill to be a shady guy who starts the fights in saloons ngl
<comment>
imagine you're yourself next time and you look hot in some cute little outfit as you're fucking beating the hell out of someone. it's cathartic
<comment>
Hahahahaha stay inside next time
<comment>
Sucks for you, foid
<comment>
I visualize grappling alot, ots a substitute to nogi since i am caught up with powerlifting and a job so i dont really have the time to go to openmats.
Then i also have episodes where i pin somebody, usually in neon belly or some half guard and elbow them fill their skulls break
<comment>
****Think about pinning somebody etc.
I am not a murderer feds, piss off
<comment>
I like to think about elbowing someone in the face or shooting for a double leg so I can give someone a concussion when I toss them but most fights are not on mats. I want to try and get up in weight so I can lift more so I can really hurt someone.
<comment>
i let my day dreams go a little too far and choked out this bitch I was with until she sized slightly, do I need to be scared?
<comment>
i imagine stabbing the only other person that stays in the classroom in lunch break and drink their blood
<comment>
It might be fun, but even in my fantasies I like to have the kind of realism that allows me to immerse more.
Like in this one DFW short story when the guy literally started learning physics to make his sexual fantasy as realistic as possible lol
But I guess I could dress my male persona in a cute hello kitty apron next time? Lol
Ye it does, fuck you :T
<comment>
You can always get on test and other types of gear to look like a man roid monster. You will turn trans but at least you will be the man you always wanted
<comment>
I was in a psych ward like 3 years ago and I got dropped to the floor by a big black employee
He was like 6'5 maybe 300+lbs and I'm here like 5'10 175lbs. I was resisting / putting up a struggle against some of the ward guards for some reason that I cant remember, but at 1 point the guard grabbed the area between my neck and shoulder and clamped down real hard and it just dropped me to the floor
I only bring this up because even as an average sized guy you are still likely to get fucked in a physical altercation by someone that's bigger than you
<comment>
i avoid that sort of thing. it's way too easy to get permanently fucked up in a street fight.
<comment>
sorry that happened but I'm different I could have taken him definitely (I'm a 5'6 female)
<comment>
I dont want to be a man. I just want the strength of one. Id rather keep it in fantasies than transition like delusional retards. 
I mean yeah, ofc men can lose to stronger men lol.
But yeah, sounds like youve been through some shit dude, hope you are better now. 
DUH
<comment>
Last fight I got in was October 21st, 2012. Leading up to it, I was feeling an itch to fight. I wasn't going to go looking for one, but I wanted to get into one. Well, one came to me. I was jumped by 10 dudes. Fucking sucked ass. I god a lotta good hits in, but I could only take so many hits to the back of the head before I couldn't anymore.
<comment>
the strength of one
Buy a gun and a knife
<comment>
anon be like 
original
<comment>
Shooting someone is not the same as crushing someones skull, breaking their ribs, kicking them so hard they throw up and feeling it all in your knuckles, tibia and burning lungs. I want to sit on a guys chest and land punches hard enough to make an unrecognizable mush of his face.
Im a big adrenaline junkie and I can imagine how good and invincible you must feel before you either get knocked out or come back to your senses.
<comment>
Hell yeah! Even a simple fight which results in no major injuries feels miles better than shooting someone.
<comment>
Im a girl.
Proofs?
I'm also a girl
Proofs?!
<comment>
If you want to see titties, go back to /b/
<comment>
it hurts so much 
like why
why did you do that
<comment>
I wish I got into more of them when I was still in school
<comment>
Even as a male, you would be far more fragile than your fantasies would lead you to believe
<comment>
But I could start lifting and be extra stronk
<comment>
I'm a girl and I fantasize about dying for a greater cause than my own existence.
I dont want to be a man. I just want the strength of one. Id rather keep it in fantasies than transition like delusional retards. 
Based, I also want to start learning martial arts for this reason even though I know it would be useless for me to learn.
<comment>
Fistfights? No. Fighting off a group of attackers with my bo staff? All the time.
<comment>
I've been in a few fights before.
You stand no chance if you're weak or small doing those things. A person would not be stunlocked while having his ear bitten, or a small monkey on his back. In order to throw sand you would first have to have it in your hand, and not having it / reaching down / reaching into pocket is a dead giveaway. I'm sorry but your only option is to run away.
As to all the girls in the thread, a trained woman can be better than a trained man. Back in the day of manual labor you'd be in for a tough fight, but a lot of the men nowadays are honestly pathetic.
This anon knows. It used to be you fought, won or lost, and that was mostly it. Nowadays there's something in the air, idk. But I wouldn't want to get in a fight because the faggots take it too far.
<comment>
I am a blue belt in bjj and have had a few street fights. Every time its my fault since I drink too much and I have won two and lost one. The one I lost I didnt get beat up too bad but it still made me feel ashamed. The two I won I also felt ashamed for being late 20s and getting in a fucking fist fight
<comment>
i have and i don't recommend it
<comment>
I rather not. Most of the time people get seriously hurt by cracking their heads on the pavement. There can be real crazies who have no problem with trying stomping on you once they manage to knock you out

That doesnt sound like its true anon
<comment>
faggots take it too far
It is a street fight, you nigger. What do you expect? Every fight is one to the death
<comment>
This post has given me a reason to start training again. I want to be ready when a kike foid thinks she is hot shit or Im drunk in the bar again

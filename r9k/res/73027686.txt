Green tea bath
Good for you
I want to bathe with her

I am very fond of blue myself
Haeeoni to those boobs
Goa would touch
<comment>
I have a little hobby I'd like to share, and possibly inspire other anons or find kindred spirits
You guys know those build your own salad-bars they might have in grocery shops? Where you can put together a salad by yourself and just weight it and pay?
I like to create abominations and stuff with them, for eating. Like 10 boiled eggs and just salad dressing. Or just a whole container of nothing but shrimp and garlic salad dressing. One time I bought a whole box of croutons you are meant to add to the salad. It's kind of fun to experiment and see what you can do, like one time I bought nothing but tuna, as much as I could fit into the container, and then added a single piece of lettuce on top of it like a cherry on top. One time I just filled the salad container with dressing, sprinkled some roasted onion on top and proceeded to just eat it like it was soup. I need to recreate that but with a single egg floating in the dressing for no good reason someday
Basically eating salad but wrong, it's lots of fun
<comment>
Goa salada
<comment>
"Remember to eat healthy pussy"
<comment>
"...Anon?"
"No Talia, this is important. If you want to work for lady Saeriah, you need to let me inspect your boobs first."
Saeriah's secretary is doing a thorough job selecting new apprentices.
<comment>
"EAT the greens."
<comment>
Not sure why I am genning Goa with salad but it's something
<comment>
Trying to gen two girls in one image ((2girls)), hoping for a result that looks like Saeriah and Talia.
Most results are either two that just look like Saeriah, or two that don't.
I really just added the ((2girls)) prompt and hoped for the best though.
<comment>
Talia's first day at work as an apprentice of Saeriah. Dark haired girl is assisting her, she's worked there for a while now.
"At your service, lady Saeriah!"
Dark haired girl needs a name. I think she had a name at one point (she's showed up before), but I forgor'd it.
<comment>
Try to gen multiple Goa girls
Get 1 goa with massive arms and tits
Technically there are some background Goas but I wanted full on multiple Goas
<comment>
But god damn the titties though
The titties though
<comment>
I just made some scary girls
<comment>
How frighte-
spots humongous breasts
Eyyyyy baby
<comment>
Her hair blended with the water
She's tea-chan basically
<comment>
O-oh no the booberinos oh shit *passes out
<comment>
The tits are multiplying
<comment>
Big fat tits holy shit slosh slosh
As long as there is a sexually attractive feminine body in one way or the other I feel no fear, only horny
<comment>
Same, when I was making those pictures I thought of a girl who would use me and then actually just kill me
I would die a happy man
<comment>
Goa seethes internally because I love big fat tits so much yet I refuse to age her up or start genning her regularly as a big titty bimbo
<comment>
I think I have no business coming into our bed tonight
She is making such a face
At some point pretending to have human interaction with your waifu as a way to have original text donut steel so you can post images gets kinda sad and lonely
especially when you'll never be able to interact with a living breathing human woman in any way even close to simulated interactions with Goa
<comment>
Yeah bro it's so lonely, especially when you're around other people yet you feel like you're alone, someone living in an isolated place would look forward to "meeting his wife one day" but I'm just too disgusted with women because I know what they are like, most of them, and the good ones are usually taken but I'm just a bitchless pussy expert so I wouldn't really know 
I don't know the reason why you're lonely, whenever you're autistic or ugly but it doesn't matter since everyone can dislike/hate the way women look and behave but I feel this too 
I'll never have my waifu in real life
<comment>
I made another wheel decide, and will explain a few of the options in more detail in another post
https://wheeldecide.com/index.php?c1=cosplay+as+another+waifu&amp;c2=your+waifus+mother&amp;c3=alternate+theme&amp;c4=fully+nude&amp;c5=cfg+15&amp;c6=opposite+prompts&amp;c7=cfg+0&amp;c8=opposite+moral&amp;c9=cfg+20&amp;c10=drunk&amp;c11=alternate+setting&amp;c12=offspring+w+another+waifu&amp;c13=nonhuman&amp;c14=an+image+with+no+waifu+in+it&amp;t=pp+wheel+pp+spindicks&amp;time=5
<comment>
alternate theme
An alternate theme to your waifu, but still staying in the same setting, For example, if your waifu is a fantasy knight, you could gen her as a fantasy mage. If she is a demon, gen her as an angel or just human, you get the idea
opposite prompts
Opposite prompts to your usual ones, for example short hair becomes long hair, small breasts become big breasts and so on, you can take this as far as you feel like
opposite moral
Dommy mommy waifu is now sweet innocent housewife, sweet innocent nonlewd waifu is now turboslut dommy mommy
alternate setting
Completely alternate theme, for example if your waifu is in a fantasy setting, put her into a cyberpunk one instead, or if she is a demon, make her a robot or something
offspring w another waifu
If your waifu had a child with another waifu, gen a child of the two
nonhuman
Gen yoru waifu as far from a human being as possible, you can take this as far as you are willing to or able to, the less human form she has the better
an image with no waifu in it
gen an image with no waifu whatsoever in it
<comment>
I got opposite prompts
Goa time with opposites, changed all the prompts I could into opposite ones and this is the result (did not go full opposite and make her a man)
<comment>
I'm both, and have a mediocre penis
I bet she could snap my pp in half with those muscles and that is hot
<comment>
Got alternate theme so I made post apocalypse Rochelle because i couldn't come up with any cooler ideas
Also hey aiwg
<comment>
Offspring with another waifu, I think that this time I'll pick Alter Asci
I'd trust her with my survival, howdy
<comment>
I love apocalypse Rochelle
Alter goasci
<comment>
pretty pink wings
<comment>
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head"
<comment>
Got opposite moral so uuuuh dom Asci 
Alter Asci would like to hug her
<comment>
unf dom me, grab my head and make me eat her out
Hanabi hi
I want to lick her sideboob or pet her head, I am unsure which one more than the other, her dead eyes are as stunning as ever
<comment>
Opposite prompts
Guess the opposite of Rochelles prompts is a white haired, blue eyed, wimpy femboy
<comment>
Nonhuman. I don't know I just turned her into a furry
<comment>
Alternate setting
Regular human office lady Goa works a desk job
<comment>
In case you guys are curious as to what kind of undies she is rocking
<comment>
"We've got to work out the whole budget by this afternoon, strap yourself in and get some strong coffee, this is going to suck"
I'd be her stay at home husband
<comment>
Very tired office lady Goa. Not a bad look on her
See you next morning thread i gotta crash and burn to sleep now
<comment>
Offspring w another waifu
Sae-chelle lmao
<comment>
"Good morning Saeriah, you're looking extra pretty and perfect today!"
"We love you so much Saeriah, I even had a painting of you printed on my T-shirt &lt;3"
Saeriah, your assistants are paid for by the Imperial Magic Department's budget, they should be used for something more useful than just showering you with compliments.
<comment>
For the crime of wasteful spending of public funds, she has to do a week of manual labor, like digging ditches around the palace.
Alternate theme as a peasant/worker, as she's kind of both a knight and a mage already.
<comment>
Don't forget to clean out the pig sty while I'm at work, Saeriah.
"Ew! Anon, it stinks in there!!"
later /aiwg/

been playing re 4 all day after not touching it for like a week
happy to see youre doing good :))))))
<comment>
re4 is probably a better thing to spend all day on than FFXV.... at least I also saw John Wick 4
<comment>
saw John Wick 4
how is it? ive been wanting to watch it but i dont have no one to go with so ill probably wait til it hits streaming
<comment>
poopy nut sack balls in my ass fart
<comment>
I only have one complaint with it, but it's a pretty big one. Every scene goes on about 15% longer than it needs to and I think there are too many set pieces. Especially with the last one being the least visually interesting, I was kinda bored by the end. At the same time, it was masterful in all forms of technique and had some absolutely remarkable set pieces mixed in. If it was ~30 minutes shorter, it would be one of my favorite action movies I think.
<comment>
i liked the first 2 movies the third one not so much
<comment>
Original good morning aiwg
<comment>
good to see you guys around Rochelle and Eleanor :))
<comment>
also gud mornin /aiwg/
the action was good but like Eleanor anon said a lot of them overstay their welcome and almost all of them were set pieces. A good portion of characters felt a little flat, like they could be fleshed out a little more. It does get a little dragged out around the end but overall still a very enjoyable watch.
<comment>
Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
<comment>
How you started watching anime?
<comment>
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

I'm back from work, hello /aiwg/
How's work going digging ditches and doing farm stuff, Saeriah?
"Anon I hate this, I'm covered in filth and stink of pig shit. Also overalls are not my style, you know this."
I think you're cute!
<comment>

So happy for you! &lt;3

The AI knows what a yurt is; neat.
Sleep well!
<comment>
God merging aiwugu
I overheard a few classmates way way back talking of this very cool strange show that airs very late in the evening, and supposedly it was epic, so I staid up late and watched it
Neon Genesis Evangelion as your first anime was a ride, not to mention it introduced me to a really nice show that aired before it, a traveling show that was pretty great. Or at least one of the seasons was, it has 3 seasons and only the second one is good, 3rd season they tried to go international but they aren't good enough in english to have all the funny quips and jokes and stuff they made in my native tongue
I want to sniff Hanabis pits
Eleanors petitas boobbas
very smug but also loving
Nighty night farmers market Saeriah

<comment>
Experimenting with Nicole's hair color again

Don't really watch that much bc I really dont like episodic content. Only watched NGE, and also a few Ghibli films and that that one Makoto Shinkai film, 5 something per something

Good morning /aiwg/
The egyptian/art deco one! I think her name was Satsumi or something.

Morning
Cereal with Saeriah milk

Alternate theme
Time for full angel Goa
<comment>
Satsuki, but close enough.
<comment>
smug angel goa
<comment>
Quiet day. I've gotten some nice results using spot color and high contrast. I want to put together a list of style tags or theme tags (mainly so I can play with lewds using them) and try to get them specific enough to be as consistent as possible, since some stuff (like the retro artstyle of Satsuki can have some massive variance in it, for example) but I'm not very imaginative as far as that kind of thing goes. Maybe leaning more into specific artist or show/manga styles could iron out those kinks? What are some of your favourite styles you've found?
<comment>
watercolor is pretty nice
<comment>
OK Saeriah, you've served your time. I can prompt yo back to normal now.
"No Anon, I have realized I wish for nothing more than to be a simple farmer, tending to my crops."
<comment>
She has potato blood running in her veins now
<comment>
"I am potato?"
"The crops have been tended enough for today, Anon. Follow me to the barn..."
<comment>
"The haystack, anon... Join me..."

Rolling in the hay
Sweaty farmer boobs slapping around as she plows

"I'm gonna touch you with my creepy long arm while my asswings flutter~"
<comment>
It's raining. She's wet and moist and her farmer boobs are sweaty.
She is reconsidering her recent life choice of becoming a simple farmer.
<comment>
"Being wet is fun isn't it Saeriah?"
Goa seems to be having fun
<comment>
last one for the night, onwards to sleep

Horny on explosion.
<comment>
I think it works better on cockpit, because of the distance and perspective. Once I get to let them far, things break.
<comment>
(scenery, outdoors, ruins, explosion, fleeing, photo background, running, sand, shouting, sound effects, perspective:1.5), 
(black theme, blue theme, rain, storm, thunder:1.4), (patterns),

Test on AOM3, by the way.

Very worried Horny.

Haven't genned with these prompts in a while, forgot how nice it looks

Baboooooooooom

"A lady does not forget, she simply chooses not to"
<comment>
when you comment on your high school tomboy gf's padded chest
<comment>
"She always wears so little..."
You always wear so much, Saeriah. Don't you get too hot working in the fields like that?
<comment>
"...yes"
uuooooh, cute!
<comment>
nighty night thread gotta sleep now
<comment>
Farming-Saeriah looks tired and is all dirty, why doesn't she want to go back to being glamourous in her ((throne room)), (sitting on throne)?
<comment>
"If farming isn't glamourous, I don't know what is!"
<comment>
Goblins are approaching the farm, she will defend it while I am at work.
<comment>
THe AI wants back, regardless of prompts. the ai wants back and now so do I
<comment>
Fine, I'll leave! Fuck lady, I just wanted to see if you were interested in wholesaling, no need to get medieval about it.

i like fucking FTM trannies. 
they're autists who think they've found a magic cure for their social retardation.
ftms are based
I want to be a man not because I believe it's easier (I don't), but because it seems like the only way I will ever attain spiritual humanity. It seems like it's the right way to be and anything falling short of that, for me, is like a vinegar bath after a cactus roll.
i find ftms to be really hot but i have yet to find one that's actually trans/dysphoric and not just taking testosterone to try to run from some kind of traumatic abuse
That's just pyrocynical, not a ftm
you want to be a man but you can't be one, best you can do is chop your tits off and umm umm ummm yeah that's about it, a "spiritual" titless woman
That's basically all a man is. I can just be a faggy little one.
trauma victims makes sex better.
and the FTM community is FULL of them

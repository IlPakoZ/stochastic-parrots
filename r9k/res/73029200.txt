But I'm lonely and don't see many options..
I was thinking of trying to make things work with this one person (we had a thing going, but I messed it up. Thing is though I'm worried about opening old wounds and about repeating my mistakes again). The issue last time was I didn't have romantic feelings for her, but I still miss her. We weren't really together, but in a way we were if that makes sense. We were basically a couple minus the intimacy. She's been single since then. Actually last time she had a bf was in high school and she's 25 now (I'm 27). 
I just want this pain of loneliness to stop. I do want a romantic partner and she would be ideal, but the attraction isn't there. I keep thinking about it. Particularly in the past few days without end. 
She's as nice as they come and the last thing I want to do is hurt her, but I'm legit struggling with suicidal thoughts due to this loneliness.

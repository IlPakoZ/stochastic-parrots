Then there is nothing except suicide. 
These thoughts are stuck with me.
<comment>

<comment>
False. He should NOT be looking to be loved the way that he is.

<comment>

<comment>
You are both faggots. Now kiss
<comment>
I have had these thoughts since childhood. I never told anyone about them except internet strangers even just recently. 
My parents will reject this. I have no friends. I cannot fit in anywhere. I probably have a couple of undiagnosed mental issues.
I am alone. This world is so big and scary.

gender is a social construct and we should let people decide what they are
except there is something so intrinsic to being a boy or a girl that you should kill yourself if you were born wrong because you will never be the opposite
why are liberals so crazy?
<comment>
We both are, faggot. Now down the HRT and choke on this dick.
<comment>
well, as much as i would like to see you happy, sometimes i too lose hope for poor people like you. but i'm sure that there are people who would care about you if you met them. sorry
i am actually thinking the same thing about suicide though.
<comment>
anon is distressed over how he was born
ill turn this into a political debate
Holy shit you need help
<comment>
who are you quoting though doe?
<comment>
idc about op and how he feels because is a trans
myself i always say things out loud so i can greentext them
<comment>
isn't your vtuber back though? could you elaborate more on why exactly you're apathetic to OP?
<comment>
What about being a woman is it that you want?
<comment>
no
didn't care about trans before, let them live, they bullied my joyful kettle and now i hate all trans people
<comment>
Everything. I am very feminine. I am fragile. I was given a Y chromosome by mistake. 
Me listing off reasons just gives you ammunition to call me a fetishist, incel, or whatever.
<comment>
if you are already feminine why would you want to have female sex? Is it just so you can cope with being weak and vulnerable?
<comment>
Hmmm no I am not here to berate or bully you. I'm actually quite sympathetic, but I also just want to know what goes through your head. And like the clown poster says though...I wonder what specifically is the "must have" of the female label. 
Like just the way you are there are people out there that you can be vulnerable with. People that would just let you be the way you are naturally? Like I understand that you might have this idea about male = rough, strong etc...
But there is no real rule that says u can't be feminine, weak, fragile etc... You can still get a strong man to hold and love and protect you?
<comment>
there doesn't exist a single gay person that could love you though.
<comment>
Is this OP opinion or just some random edgy retard?
<comment>
I'm OP. He's not.
<comment>
are you in a loyal homo relationship?
then reply
<comment>
Yeah since like a bit short of a decade?
<comment>
Stop being a cringe faggot and start being a normal faggot instead. What the hell is wrong with you. Instead of this pathetic defeatist attitude, be angry at those who implanted these delusions in your brain. The first person who told you about "gender" has by all means earned being punched in the face by you at the very least.
<comment>
Women are not inherently fragile you delusional fuck. I take back what I said before, I don't care about you anymore. You're a misogynistic scrote who wants to define womanhood and therefore affect *my* life according to your retarded failed male fantasies. 
Fuck you.

how can this sigma queen be more masculine than OP?

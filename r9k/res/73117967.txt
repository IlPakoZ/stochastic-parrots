People can die from practically anything but going to the Dentist isn't a big deal. I didn't take care of my teeth for years and my mouth looked like I was chewing on a brick, I've been to the Dentist dozens of times in the last year and I've gotten all sorts of work done. Ask for Nitrous Oxide, you can get a little high while they work on you and it makes the whole thing worth it.

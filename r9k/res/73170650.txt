Usually the man cheats. I have been with my wife for 8 years. Bad luck, sport.

Not many people moves states, you are attracting a specific breed of women. For the next time, try to change your selection pool.

If you get this mad over pixels I can't imagine what you'd get mad at a woman about.

Immigrants strengthen our country because we let them. In their home countries they are treated like dogs because of corruption. Oddly enough, nonimmigrants in the US are lazier than dogs.

date "women"

<comment>
Ah, so that's why. There you go, OP, you just have to convince your town to respect wammen more and they'll stop migrating to other ones.
<comment>
THEYRE NOT. STOP CHASING WHORES

<comment>
If OP is still in it, maybe the town will move to one of his ex-gfs and it will be a net win.
<comment>
He date?
Move it
<comment>
women just wanna cheat on u bro whats up with that huh
<comment>
Exactly. They probably want to break up with you but either don't want to say it because they'd feel bad about letting you down or think you'd kill them.
Judging by your attitude in this thread, it's probably the latter.
<comment>
Okay, okay. What if... you date long distance with someone who has already moved away? When they move, it will be moving TO you instead of away from you.
<comment>
FUCK YOU
I HELPED MOST OF THEM PACK

Do moids realize that when they say stuff like this, everyone can instantly tell they are pornography addicts?
You say that like we care lol
Everyone knows that 40-60% of men are basically porn addicts
Any man who is scared of women, sees them as a different species, or cant relate to women is always a porn addict.
not just women, 97% or so of people are different species
Well I have three sisters and none of them are like 95% of the women (and 95% of women in general) I interact with irl 
Only my oldest sister is the closest to a normie girl but she's still not a braindead cock sucking whore like 95% of the women I meet 
They really are a different species

i dream of a game show where robot and robot adjacent elements just like me present and showcase their shitty worthless lives in front of a live studio audience and a panel of celebrity judges (there's a paternal nice one like Dr Phil, a severe but maternal one like Judge Judy, a sweet-but-dim valley girl type who is all sympathy and tears, and an asshole comedian who roasts you like Howard Stern). we all compete on whether and how we should be allowed to die. audience votes, judges decide the appropriate form of euthanasia (firing squad, eaten by wild animals, limbs sliced off with a ninja sword, the list goes on) and at the end of the show the lucky winner is executed for the entertainment of the masses. it would be so fulfilling to have millions of people caring about and paying attention to me for just a little while and to have my agony ended while also providing thrills and economic activity. i want this so badly

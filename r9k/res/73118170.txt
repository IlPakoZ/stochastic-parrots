People hate trannies because:
men are to be invisible
men are to be disposable
ready to fight at the expense of their physical health and beauty
ready to do dirty work at the expense of their physical health and beauty
not admired for their beauty, only for their production
If you become trans you say you want to be the center of attention. You say your looks mean a lot to you. You have the pretension that your looks are to give you value. This goes against men as a killing-fucking machine- This is why transition is despised by all. I'll leave the value judgement up to you.
we don't hate trannies for being weird, disgusting, nonsensical and delusional, there are far worse people out there
we hate them because they can't keep it to themselves, and go as far as demanding we play along with their bullshit, otherwise we're nazis who want them dead or smth, which ironically might be a self fulfilling prophecy

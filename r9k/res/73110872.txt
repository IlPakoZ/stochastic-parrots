Technically, if I was to drive around somewhere, and I get a flat tire or my car stops working, I am stuck. I have no one to call. I am fucked. Do I just call the police if that ever happens? I have no friends. One time I was 400km away from home and my car wouldnt start the first 3 times, I have this fear since. I have no idea how I would proceed if that were to happen. I can't call even my mom and dad.

have some tools to possibly fix it. you call emergency or some pickup service. or wait for another car. or pack a bike for a quick trip to the nearest gas station.

Never had a car or drivers' license
Never had this fear
Never had sex
Never had to worry about unwanted impregnation
Theoretically, I could be driving with my gf who had a hysterectomy, when we get a flat tire and run out of gas on a deserted roadside. We then fuck in the back seat and I cum in her pussy without a condom, before I look at the Thomas Guide for the nearest service center, take a picture of the flat tire, open the fold-out bicycle and ride for a few hours into town where I get a mechanic to drive me back with fuel, a new tire and tools to install it. Or just call AAA if there is reception and I have power.

Why not just hitch a ride to nearest Civilization and get some mechanic? You don't even need to do that because of they have ads all over the google maps.

There's really nothing you can do. You just die, I guess. I've wondered this too OP, so I keep a slingshot and a propane cookstove in my trunk just in case.

Two times I broke down in the middle of nowhere. One time there was cell service so I just had to call around to find and wait for a local tow and mechanic. One time there was no cell service so I had to walk miles to the nearest house for them to call someone local who could help, turned out to be an older redneck lady with mechanic experience. She was friendly enough and offered to do everything, but pretty bluntly asked for a fuck in exchange after I wasn't able to pay or offer anything else for her help.

That is hilarious. Imagine a woman asking you for a fuck because you dont have money. Amazing

Not that I complained, but obviously I would have preferred if she was hot. But then what's to expect from some old redneck lady in nowheresville.

I'm tired of people defining me by who I'm not and what I don't have instead of what I don't have.
Being friendless does not define me as a person. Being a virgin does not define me as a person.
How do I get people to just accept me for who I am and stop judging me for things beyond my control? All I want is to be treated with the same respect everyone else is treated with.

You are a friendless virgin and nothing more. U mad? Make a friend and have sex

if EVERYONE is judging you based on what you lack, it seems to me like you have nothing else to be judged on. If being friendless doesn't define you, what does, anon?

My personality, the things I do to help people. Judge me for who I am, not for what my life is missing.

stop judging me for things beyond my control
those are like the only 2 things on the fucking planet that aren't beyond your control

I don't have friends because everyone I meet and talk to is a fucking faggot that I can't stand, honestly. The less I interact with people, the better I feel.

virgin is one thing, but if you're friendless it either means you're really shy (hence people don't get to know you and default to judging you on aforementioned things) or are genuinely a boring, empty shell of a person.

I'm not shy and I'm not boring. I'm friendless because all of the people I thought were my friends have moved on with their lives and don't have time to hang out anymore. The closest person I ever had to a "best friend" died a few years ago. I'd like to make new ones, but I can't find anyone. Every place I go to try to find friends is empty, no matter what day or time of day I go.

I think the solution to your problem is to make new friends. Clearly everyone saying this is bothering you, otherwise you wouldn't have posted. You don't need everyone to stop judging you on baseless shit, but as long as you have some friends who know the "real" you, most people are satisfied with that. Making friends out of school/uni is hard and takes a lot of concentrated sustained effort. All i can say is don't give up.

I've been trying to make new friends. I can't find any anywhere, that's the problem. Pretty much every place people traditionally go to meet people is dead.
I want to socialize with people, but I can't, because the only place I can find any people is at work.

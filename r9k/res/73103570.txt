I'm supposed to be out here doordashing but instead I'm sitting in a Food Lion parking lot too scared to go into any restaurant. I'm too scared to be seen by other people. What mental illness is this?
Literal white women tier mental illness. Now make a tiktok out of it faggot.
agoraphobia i believe anon
you probably have low t
I just hate being seen as make, the pariah slave class of society
Hearing someone refer to me as such ( pronouns, etc) makes me sick, akin to calling a black person a nigger slave, like they are trying to compel me into physical servitude subconsciously 
Is this schizo?
Male*
do you have gender dysphoria or something?
The internet has corroded your brain may you die slow
Yeah that's why I'm afraid of being seen also because I know people see me as a joke and less than them
Oh wait you are talking about some tranny s*** never mind. I'm op by the way not this guy
meme word
it's just called pattern recognition and growing up as a zoomer male in a feminized world
garden variety social anxiety bro
congrats on being boring
why are you worried about being seen? everyone is grotesque and ugly. even attractive people.
do you think a naked molerat thinks about how ugly other naked molerats are? even the most attractive naked mole rat is ugly to us.
look at steve buscemi, dudes made an entire career about being ugly. who fucking cares.
even stacy is going to look like an ugly worn out grandma in 30 years.
just go into the damn grocery store
buy the shit
drive it to the damn customer and LARP like you're grocery boy. Who fucking cares? They don't. they just want their groceries and are too lazy to get it themselves. just make your money so you can eat.

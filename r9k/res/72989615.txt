you're so sweet and adorable, you'll find a girl that will love you one day, that girl just isn't me... and every other girl I know... because it just so happens we're all sharing the same men tee hee

Last girl who tried to support me as an incel I took the oussy from her.
<comment>
i can prove that wrong anon, that girl can, and hopefully will be me!
<comment>

Anon... you're not a girl :/
<comment>
i know you are an incel and i know you do not get enough love and affection in your day-to-day, that makes me love you. not out of pity, but because i know you deserve it.
i also think the peepos you use are cute.

If you're a bio fem, which country? I want to see if you're for real
<comment>
Yeah but you're probably a million miles away, femanon. How would you give me love and affection?

Well, you might have to go that far. I live in Texas and you? We could talk if you want, I just don't like the idea of being friends with someone that lives so far away that I'll probably never see them in person

sis, girls who pander to ugly moids have serious internalized misogyny issues going on. seek help
<comment>
Yes, god forbid a woman is ever nice to us. Go away
<comment>
a woman showing love and compassion
"she must hate herself and her kind"
not everyone is poisoned like (You), sis
<comment>
Hey, a woman can hate herself without being a misogynist you fucking loser.
<comment>

there's a difference between being nice and saying "i'll love an ugly man". incels are ugly men and really, the honest truth is, i'd rather kms than date an ugly moid
i'm honest but you're just a gaslighter. you're gonna ghost any guy who turns out be a real incel, you want an eboy who is "incel" for the aesthstic, not a real ugly moid. you're not any different from all of us, "sis"

What if I'm not incel?

<comment>

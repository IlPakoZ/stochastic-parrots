I love the thought that everyone on here is depressed and seething that they cannot get a gf/bf or be in any sort of relationship of any kind.
You complain about your situation of being fat, socially inept, and maidenless, but instead of doing anything to change this, you come on here to complain. 
It makes me feel so good about myself; that I have enough self efficacy and agency compared to all of you losers to go out and do something about my problems instead of complain here. 
So instead I come here to observe and laugh at all of you, as I am just better because of my current mindset. I wish you all never change so I can continue doing so.

As insecure as some of these retarda, aren't you?

Based normalfag. R9k has always been a circlejerking session of insufferable people trying to make excuses for their own problems that they have FULL ABILITY to solve, but find more excuses not to.

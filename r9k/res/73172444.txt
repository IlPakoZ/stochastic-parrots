Why is the female sex unable to take some mild jokes?

Why is the female sex unable to take some mild jokes?
Princess complex. View themselves as royalty, think they deserve to have their asses kissed.
<comment>
Because men are socially retarded.
Telling a woman she would be easy to rape isnt a joke.
<comment>
Then why is it so funny

I am going to rape you

I could easily rape you
I am going to rape you
Huge difference
<comment>
I chuckled but he shouldn't yell at cats
<comment>
why would you ever want to say that to someone anon
<comment>
As a joke? I dont see a problem with it
<comment>
How do you feel about jokes about white extinction?
<comment>
I laugh if its something witty. Cause it's a joke.
<comment>
I dont think you do laugh, regardless of how witty. I actually think you have a little spergout toddler tantrum whenever you see someone making a comment about white extinction. Or cuckoldry. Or emasculating and humiliating white men or playing up black sexual stereotypes. 
Maybe think about that the next time you make a rape joke.
<comment>
vanilla sex is boring
<comment>
So I take it you found that billboard with the black guy and blonde white girl advertizing underwear and saying get them before they go extinct hilarious. Because that was actually pretty witty and clever. Right? Did you laugh at that, anon?
<comment>
because women have no personalities. they're whole shtick is getting fucking hysterically upset over things that objectively do not matter
<comment>
anon if i kept joking about how you should kill yourself everyday, at that point it stops turning into a joke and you take it seriously.
now imagine that with women online, hearing about the millions of comments about "i know their pussy is *random hex color*" "you look rapeable" jokes like that don't turn into jokes anymore, but rather weird gross statements they have to hear everyday from weird gross men.
put urself in other people shoes anon

getting hysterically upset over things that do not matter 
Like white extinction?
<comment>
who cares about the amount of certain ethnic groups man as long as people are treated equally
<comment>
It also wasnt really even a joke. It was like saying. Hey your throat looks really easy to slice open. I dont think anyone would find that funny. I dont think anyone would just laugh that off or feel good after hearing that from someone. Even online. 
In fact I wonder how funny the anons in this very thread would find the exact same comment being sent to them by a guy. Or said to them in person. A guy saying to them that they look really easy to hold down. 
Suddenly I bet the smile would vanish. Suddenly I bet it would not be funny at all. 
Always with the hypocrisy here. It is genuinely exhausting and depressing. Sadly these people are too lacking in self-awareness to just kill themselves
<comment>
Frankly, i just don't care about the feelings of some ass on legs. if she wants to cry about a fuckin rape joke on da intewnet she can
<comment>
not defending it, but OP is really cute, I just want to tease her or play with her like I would a puppy, it is an "intrusive thought", Drepa isn't like a batshit insane sadist who likes the idea of slitting people's throats, he is just a social retard
<comment>
Would you find it funny if a much larger m, stronger man than you kept making comments about raping you? Honestly. Would you laugh at that?
<comment>
i might find it a turn on to be completely honest with you
<comment>
I can see this is absolutely pointless. Enjoy your constant ostracization and potential imprisonment, or getting beaten to death by someone someday.
<comment>
aw, the cunt is mad
go back to bleeding out of your scab of ab oriface
<comment>
Not defending it, you just happen to be incorrect on that particular detail. That is why it is pointless trying to convince me.
You for example probably want to bludgeon my face in for proving you wrong, your anger makes you think I am disagreeing with you as a whole not in part even though I carefully explained I am not defending it. This is an intrusive thought rather like Drepa. You are very much like Drepa psychologically speaking, you just have a different set of impulses.
<comment>
you guys lack empathy and the ablity to recognize whats fucked up, im sorry guys i wish i could help u recognize it, but that peace will have to come through your guy's own journey.
<comment>
maybe if women were empathetic to me for once in my entire life it would be fine
<comment>
it doesn't matter. you're retarded if you take some edgy comment a guy makes toward you so seriously. why can't you just brush it off or give it back? women act like they've been shot, it's pathetic.
<comment>
anon u dont need women to be empathetic to you, to make you empathetic.
it all starts with yourself fr, you will never meet the girls that were mean to you again. you can make a new start now anon
its just up to you to walk that path
<comment>
this, it's not funny OP get sexually assaulted and you'll understand
<comment>
That's not much a joke by itself. And even then, it's just shit humour-wise.
But anyway, different genders to mean different cultures. And what's humourous in one culture is easily different in another.
<comment>
have someone close to you commit suicide and then you'll understand why it's not funny to say kys!
no you're just an entitled crybaby.
<comment>
Women deserve to be raped tho, they put themselves in these positions

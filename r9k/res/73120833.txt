50 50 lottery, and i lost it
Having 50 years, every month almost insane pain and bleeding.
Getting huge boobs and massive back pain because of that.
Fuck up once due condom ripped and get kid.
Giving birth to that kid with massive pain.
Need to whore yourself as nobody wants to take you seriously.
Have mental issues, emotions all the time. 
Fuck it feels good to be born as man.

that's literally what all robots want, but just doing the fucking ( due to hormones )
How is it any different?

Yea dude!
So much better to:
go bald
become angular and boxy
grow freakishly tall
get hairy and smelly
lose your ability to feel emotions and socialize as well
be expected to be a mere tool
people become afraid of you
live on an emotional island
be expected to always provide and never be provided for
die earlier
kill yourself more
get held and loved less as a child
not be nearly as allowed to self express
gain a deep, scary monotonous robot voice
not even really be loved, just tolerated by the opposite sex to help them toward their own egocentric goals
lack the near magical ability to literally grow a human from ones own flesh and blood
hated by modern society 
BT AT LEAST BEARDS ARE FUCKING AWESOME MY DUDE

I wish 
I still feel emotions strongly but grew to be socially awkward so I keep it to myself
It's a curse I tell ya

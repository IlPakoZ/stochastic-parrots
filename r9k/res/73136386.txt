It's a psyop. People in the post-modern era are made believe that sex is the main thing. People never believed that through all history, because it's obviously nonsense. When people have sex they realise that and move on with other things. When they don't have, they fall for the psyop and become fuel for the culture war. It's very sad and unnecessary.

Had sex dozens of times. It's just not that big of a deal. Feels like you're just accomplishing a task like playing vidya. There's satisfaction from accomplishing the task, but all the bullshit like having to act like you gaf about her is tiring. Life is just so transactional bullshit. I'm lying to her and it's just mentally exhausting. Sex is overrated

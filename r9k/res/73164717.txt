I would kill for a chance to talk to him again. It should be easier with each day but i feel worse and worse. I can't sleep at nights. I keep crying. Today i'm having chest pains as well. I don't feel like doing anything. I force myself but it's all meaningless. I can't cope with losing him.

Dont know if you are a fag or a fembot but I feel the same, not about him but about a girl. Hope you get through it anon.

sometimes you need to move on, memories like these only torment those who cant let go. I believe in you!

Also what happened to him? If you dont mind me asking.
<comment>
No one made me laugh like he did. No one made me cry as much either. I feel like an emotionless robot when interracting with others. I want to scream until i lose my voice forever

Nothing happened to him. He is alive and, hopefully, well. We broke up and also stopped talking altogether after a while. I'm obsessed, that's all
<comment>
Will he still remember me after a year? Two? When he gets older and more jaded? Would he even care if i died?
Welp, i will always remember him for as long as i live. I couldn't make him happy despite how much i loved him ;-;

well give me a hint so i can see if you're my ex i'm consciously trying to stop myself from reaching out to because i can see her suffering
<comment>
I'm not your ex, don't worry about it. He doesn't browse this board, which is why i'm venting here. If he wanted to talk to me he would only get hurt and waste his time cause i'm unfixable. Best thing for him is to avoid me. That doesn't mean i can't be sad about it though. Or still love him. Sorry you feel this way about someone too but i can't help you there :(

I don't want to die but i hate being alive too. I just want to hug him for a moment and fall asleep

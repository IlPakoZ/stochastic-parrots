Be me 
Never socialized with people before
Always thought it was for chumps
About to be 25
Socialized a bit in college with some people
Have fun laugh together and stuff
Days over everyone moves on with their lives until we meet again next week
Realize how much of a sack of shit I was these from 18-23 years of age
Now I can't stop thinking about the fun I had and how cold and lonely the world can be when being by yourself and can't stop thinking how wrong I was and want to turn my life around. I want to do better. I will do better.

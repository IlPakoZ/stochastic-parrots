There was utterly no point in internalizing that anime/games are embarrassing and pretending not to like them. I wound up alone anyway. The people I wanted to impress by acting normal are married to each other. I'm closing in on 30.

yeah, I don't know why you would do that
not everyone is gonna get along with you or have the same interests, so lying to yourself can only benefit the people who don't like what you like

29, playing a character in life instead of being true to himself
Oof. Well, I guess it's better than being 60 and realizing it.
If you let your likes and dislikes be dictated by others you will eventually have no likes and sit around worrying if person X likes you for what you do. That is ultra-normie shit. Disregard and play vidya. Life is to be savored.

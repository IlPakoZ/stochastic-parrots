You should stop being so closed minded and give a lonely trans girl a chance.
<comment>
A chance to fuck off and stop pretending to be something he's not.

They're all fugly and can't get pregnant

Lonely trans girls are for Stacy (formely Chad) only

I did they tried to use me for money to pay for their hrt. I have many screenshots of ones on lgbt bragging about doing the same. Most are 
lesbians
anyways and are just looking for orbiters to drain of money. Unironically worse than women.
<comment>
Hot ones are like 98 percent lesbians.

Worst of both worlds:
not biologically female; has cock n balls, masculine bone structure, etc
still woman-brained enough to have all of women's worst traits

I used to be a chud and now I have an adorable pure loving trans gf! I love you &lt;3
Trans girls are girls, dough.
can't get pregnant
You clearly haven't tried.
/lgbt/ tranners are demonic. There are adorable sweet ones like OP.

And where the fuck do you find them then. Every mtf posting here gets 15 replies begging for discord. They are over competed for just like cis women.

No thanks I prefer real women + want children of my own
<comment>
Nice, I thought you were banned
<comment>
Such a guy that you settle for less and look at pair bonding rationally
<comment>
You clearly haven't tried
I don't think kids are literal cum-stained shit

The truth is that most chasers are dogshit human beings, so being a decent one of the bunch is far easier and will be more appreciated. You don't even have to be very special, just better than the dogshit they deal with 24/7.
I'm trannykuns friend posting for him, don't worry.
That's not a sentence.
Try harder, anon.

I'm not attracted to men, so I will not give trans girls a chance
<comment>
honest question, as a 'straight' trans woman, aren't you paranoid that any 'straight' guy you date is just a fag/tranny in denial
<comment>
I mean I could date cis women before but mtfs found me repulsive
<comment>
That is a common issue, though most reasonable MtFs who want bf's realize their bf's are bi.
I imagine you got unlucky, though the /lgbt/ ones are 80% garbage.

Am completely straight, 28-year-old man
The thought of wearing a mid-length plain skirt out in public with my legs touching sounds fantastic
Why?
You have a crossdressing fetish retard
Can't, I'm a grown man with children, a family, etc.
10 years ago I experimented with cross-dressing one time and an older man (in his late 40s) told his Asian girlfriend (who gave me all the girl clothes as a joke) at the time to give me a bunch of drugs, which I naively took all at once to show off to the girl because I wanted to fuck the girl. Well I was barely conscious after a few minutes and the older man raped my mouth and left me passed out in his house. True story.
Also the sight of my very masculine face after cross-dressing is painful to see. I'm not pretty in a dress. But for some reason a single skirt seems appealing.
By "seems appealing" do you mean you just want some skin contact on your legs, or do you mean it makes you horny. If the former, just wear a kilt or something. The latter is definitely a fetish though.
but I'm not scottish
Don't wear a tartan kilt, just a normal one.
you aren't straight, youre a faggot
as an actual straight man, if I see a guy doing this in public, in my mind you are 100% a pedophile, as are all gay people.
Just wear a kilt
I want the fabric to be thin and soft for some reason. Just seems similar to wearing only underpants. I have times I wish I looked like a girl though, but I have 0 attraction to the male body in any way. I like soft-looking things.

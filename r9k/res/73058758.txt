how would you react if someone hugged you right now?
I would hug them back, assume it was some strange bit and move on with my day.
It depends how they smell. Women have hugged me and it smelled like heaven, and I never wanted to wash the shirt I wore when we embraced. Then I have been hugged by people who smell like armpit BO, and afterwards I feel disgusting until I can get home, put my shirt inside a plastic bag in the laundry hamper, and take a shower.
Anger, everything makes me angry any more, especially when people feign kindness of any sort. It's completely directionless at this point, I just get angry and have to fume for an hour or two until it fizzles out.
depends on who it is, especially at this hour
Depends who and how they are. Not everyone could hug me, but if they have good hygiene, then sure and I would hug them back.
Feel nothing. How could i
if i liked them i would be hypnotized. i haven't touched a human willingly in years. nice one op. made me think.
I'd freeze up
i want to hug someone who would cry and i could comfort them :c
the last time a stranger hugged me it was a random girl in highschool and i tensed up until she let go. Hugs are gross.
probably OK. I'd hug a robobro
withdraw + harden
Honestly this even though I want to do the opposite.

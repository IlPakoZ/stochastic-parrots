how would you react if someone hugged you right now?

I would hug them back, assume it was some strange bit and move on with my day.

It depends how they smell. Women have hugged me and it smelled like heaven, and I never wanted to wash the shirt I wore when we embraced. Then I have been hugged by people who smell like armpit BO, and afterwards I feel disgusting until I can get home, put my shirt inside a plastic bag in the laundry hamper, and take a shower.

Anger, everything makes me angry any more, especially when people feign kindness of any sort. It's completely directionless at this point, I just get angry and have to fume for an hour or two until it fizzles out.

depends on who it is, especially at this hour

Depends who and how they are. Not everyone could hug me, but if they have good hygiene, then sure and I would hug them back.

Honestly this even though I want to do the opposite.

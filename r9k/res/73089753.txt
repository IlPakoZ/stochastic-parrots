Always picked on as kid. Discriminated by locals and not taken into any immigrant clicks because white. Your women cucking you for any Westoid with a green card. Any sign of enjoying or sharing your culture is met with hostility. Before at least I could live in exile but somehow in peace, now with the war I am also guilty in the eyes of others for monke man actions. 
There is no returning home either (cause that means mobilization). Slavs hate me, Westerners hate me, Africans and Arabs dont need me, Women hate me, everyone looks at me differently. My "people" in the West are cucks who pretend to be a Westerner and are afraid of interacting with me because that will expose them and the other side are low IQ gopniks who are ziggers and alcoholics. 
At this point, the only solution I have as a Russkie is to 90sgangstermaxx in looks so that at least I could feel more confident on the street. No white person have it worse than Russians.

I am Russkie and grew up in Germany. We are the third biggest minority here and literally nobody does shit whenever a Russian talks about being patriotic. We also have the backs of various Arabs and other Migrant groups because we are considered anti-western and therefore have something in common. Come to Germany bro

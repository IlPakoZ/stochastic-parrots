Gaming sucks ass these days.

gaming has never been better. they took all the parts that made last generation gaming good and improved on it. the only issue is, now were old and no women love us, so we don't enjoy anything, even our hobbies.

Lmao no they didn't. Most games are broken on release or are designed like literal slot machines. 
Back in 90s and 00's Games USED to have split screen co-op where you could invite your friends over to play. Now games just try to extract as much money as possible out of you while giving you anything in return.

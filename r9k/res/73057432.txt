robots if you had a gf and she asked you to dress up and rp as a fictional character during sex. would you do it. pic only related if any of you say yes
No definitely not. Not unless she was an absolute 9/10 in all categories
If she made the outfits im not spending the kind of money that shit requires just for a sexual fantasy.
Most guys (read not robots) would definitely be down for it if it would get you off, but I personally would be out of by it. Aren't you basically actively working to help them fantasize and cum to someone who isn't you?
Most normies don't have a problem about fantasies and stuff like this about fictional characters, but I don't think I'd want to date a girl who had an obsession on one, especially a sexual obsession.
put off by it*
I'm ugly but sure I could try
I'd be flattered, I'd ask her to cosplay a character too.
yes - depending on the character. don't want it to become furfaggotry. i'd also prefer it to be a rarer act, so that I assume she's not simply pretending I am the fantasy character all the time and actually likes me for me. have no issue with indulging stuff like this, as I assume I have weird shit she'd find strange too.
My bf wont cosplay denji when I put on my makima cosplay and let me sit on his face.
Why live?
I'll be Eren and she'll be Mikasa, but she better be a pretty convincing Mikasa, e.g. having a fit body and being super strong. I'll also be quite convincing as I'll just be an angry autist starting fights everywhere.
if i get back with my ex bf i will cosplay at cons/events and in bed with him to our hearts content &lt;3
Women lose all respect for men who do this kind of shit. It's a trap.
i dont mind
too bad im dying alone
I'd try but I can't promise I'd be good at it
and I'd want her to rp and dress as someone for me too
discord?

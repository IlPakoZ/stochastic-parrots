be me (khv) about 10 months ago
discover this cool 6 hours album experience (image related)
ask a female friend about listening it together, she somehow agrees
chilling on her couch and about 2 hours in and she lays on my lap out of the blue
she takes my hand and puts it in her boob
start panicking about it (plus instinctive boner) and she asks "wanna kiss?"
I give in because fuck it (also it would've been really awkward if I said no, right guys?)
she takes her shirt and bra off and gets on top of me, things didnt escalate just kissing
eventually stop (about 3 hours into the album)
somehow I feel scammed/robbed because she didn't lay a single finger on me and start feeling very upset about it (I didn't say anything because anxiety kicked in)
about 5 hours in she asks me to masturbate her (with all her clothes on of course)
agree because I'm just so over it
eventually use my ring finger to touch her clit (or what I assume was the clit because it was slimy and she started moaning when i rubbed it)
she eventually came and I was just there out of sync with the present (didn't even have a boner at this point)
adding insult to injury, when I took my hand out of her pants it smelled FOUL. I could compare the smell of that shit only to a high schooler rotten armpit that hasn't taken a bath in weeks
Fortunately the album ended about 10 minutes after she came so I told her I had to leave
before I stepped out of her house she whispers into my ear "you're the first person to make me come this hard, thanks"
ghost her on every social media and cut her off a couple months later
told my mom about it and she said "you should be thankful for the fact that a woman even let you touch her"
still pissed to this day that she didn't even touch me in the slightest and avoided contact with women since then
Is it over for me, anons? Should I give up all hope on losing my virginity and become a full time wizard?

women are retarded 
unless you push the limits, you're gonna end up like me (living in the same house with my gf for over a year and a half, and still no intercourse) 
life is hell

i get rock hard reading this greentext, meanwhile this retard can't get hard while fingering a wet girl.

There is no way you are living with a woman you hwve never fucked
<comment>
You should've fucked you retard. Also women are the ultimate coomers, they only care if you give them pussy tingles, hence her thanking you for that. 99% of interactions with women are based on if you give them pussy tingles or the ick, guys are visual so it's way more obvious they're coomers, the dirty secret women have is that they are all huge coomers just it's mental for them instead of visual

What's worse, being a virgin who made a woman cum or a non-virgin who sucks at sex?
<comment>
what a way to get caught off guard. also its a shame the first vagina you fingered smelled bad. if its like right out of the shower fresh its like sucking the inside of your elbow so its pretty decent. although everyone is roasting you for not banging this chick it was probably the best thing to do at the time.

you didn't escalate once, she was doing all the work, you have no one to blame but yourself
<comment>
my situation is beyond any hope 
if jesus were to come down on earth and I'd show up to see him, he'd start running faster than sonic and flash combined 
she always says that her pussy hurts (I half get that)
but for christ sake she has another hole that can be fucked 
ok bitch you don't like anal, but you have a mouth and hands, right? 
sure, but we never do anything spontaneous, and max twice a week (if it's a good week) 
haha I forgot to mention, I don't know how to bj, and my handjobs are quite bad 
I just wish I were alone

zoomer men are completely woman-brained. you are supposed to be a man and escalate things instead of passively waiting for her to touch you. you could have fucked her or at least gotten a bj 
living in the same house with my gf for over a year and a half, and still no intercourse
my gf tried something similar:
day 1
I tell her in advance I won't pressure her for sex. we just cuddle
days 2-6 
I keep trying and get rejected for anything beyond rubbing her tits and pussy while she's clothed.
day 7 
find out she's a virgin and wants to wait like a year lol. tell her no way and pressure her for sex. fucked her twice and the rest is history

Dude, you gotta stop with the datura. That shit's gonna kill you at some point.

Did you take her hand an try to make her grab you? Maybe she was too shy/autistic.
Anyways you probably now ruined ever enjoying those albums since now they will be tainted with this unpleasant memory. You played yourself.

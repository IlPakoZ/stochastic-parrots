I hate women. Not because they won't sleep with me but because I've spent my entire life watching them, time and time again, chase after abusive men. To the detriment of themselves, their children, and those close to them. It is infuriating to watch.

I can only be assed to care if it's a woman I am interested in myself

Because nobody likes a passive loser. Nobody. You can be the nicest guy in the world, you can be rich as fuck. But in your genes you are not a go-getter, you are not a man of action, and you will not be able to beat up anybody that threatens your woman. You'll call the cops at the first sight of confrontation, or back away, or do some 'mature adult' thing that women will say it's okay for you to do, but deep down inside they resent it. They see you as less of a man and more of a little brother or a resource they can take advantage of.
That's just how they are. In fact I think it's not just women but guys too. Abusive guys with anger problems tend to have a lot more male and female friends compared to their nice guy alternative. Deep down inside people just like violence no matter what they say.

Why don't you hate the abusive men? They're the ones doing the actual abusing. But that's not important to you, is it?

well most normalfags are psychopaths who would step over your dead body to get a better parking spot

Who says I don't? The fact is though, they can be avoided. But they choose not to avoid them and continue to go back to those same men. Even when they have kids that are obviously being hurt by the situation, they STILL do it. It's disgusting

Yeah, but nowhere near as disgusting as the actual child abuse you are doing nothing to stop so you can feel good for shitting on a woman you barely know.

What? Do women have no free will or agency now? And how would I even stop it? Even if I could, they'd immediately run back to those kinds of men, the first chance they got. Because that's just how women are

All men are abusive. That's why most people hate men.

You can't control their decisions. You can control your own. If child abuse disgusts you so much go out and actually do something instead of shitting on women who are indirectly responsible at best.
And how would I even stop it? 
Make money and donate it to women's shelters that give women a chance to escape abusive men. Somehow I doubt you will.
Even if I could, they'd immediately run back to those kinds of men, the first chance they got.
You have no control over your decisions, you do have control over yours. It dosen't matter to the actual fucking kids who is at fault, what matters is stopping the abuse. But here we find you laying blame and doing nothing to actually help, so you're no better than these women you hate.
vBecause that's just how women are
Yeah, and you talk a lot of shit while being totally morally bankrupt yourself. Just how incels are.

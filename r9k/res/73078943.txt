Your idea of fun is cringe.
If you're cringe you aren't invited, simple as.

I know everything that will happen
I have the power to change everything
No, I won't cure your kid with cancer (or just make cancer disappear), I won't stop wars, I won't because... It's a test! (For which I already know the outcome)
Yes, I made you so you can have free will (even though I know everything you will do) and you will go to hell to be punished horribly forever if you fuck up (even though I could have just not made you in the first place if I knew you would suffer eternally) because I love you!

Why should He
<comment>
Because he loves us. Because he is all-good. Because seeing your own creation kill each other horribly shouldn't be pleasant. Because kids with cancer or born into war did literally nothing wrong. Because why would he allow it in the first place.
Looking forward to reading your mental gymnastics.

the Devil called me a bitch so I threw him into a pit of boiling excrement
he works for me now, torturing anyone else who also calls me a bitch
Why would the devil serve God's will? 
I got kicked out of Sunday school for asking questions.
<comment>
he loves us.
Maybe humanity's view of love is not the same as that of a omniscient powerful being. Maybe "love" to a God is literally giving the chance to not get tortured for eternity immediately 
Why would he allow it in the first place
Who knows the motivation of a powerful God that can do as He pleases.
<comment>
The devil went up to heaven and told me some guy would stop loving me if I killed his entire family, took everything away from him, and also made him feel constant pain.
I took the challenge
Disingenuous reasoning anon. You sound like a woman who suffers domestic violence defending her husband.
Maybe "love" to a God is literally giving the chance to not get tortured for eternity immediately
Do you really not see how absurd and awful this sounds? The god you believe in is a real piece of shit.
<comment>

Then why create the torture in the first place?
Why the trap in Eden, that any parent of a three-year-old could see was a trap. Are human parents smarter than God? 
"I'm a loving mom; I just put a shiny piece of candy in the middle of my child's room and told them I'd beat them for the rest of eternity if they ate it, then left..."
If a human knows this "test" is going to fail, does that mean God is more of a fool than a simple human? If God is omnipotent he knew his trap would work before he even thought of it. It was bait, deliberately, to excuse the torture of his creations at best.
You worship a Lawful Evil deity that uses fear and threat of punishment to control their followers, yet gives absolutely no blessings to those who stay in line.
<comment>
You sound like a woman who suffers domestic violence defending her husband.
Why are you comparing a human male to a divine and omniscient being? You have been viewing God through the lens and standards of humans this entire thread
Do you really not see how absurd and awful this sounds?
I never said I don't. It is conventionally cruel. I merely made a possible assumption of the pretext in which God's love became a worldwide phenomenon in which half the earthly population believes in. Theoretically, Hell is as real as God is, according to the Bible; furthermore, we are supposedly all destined for Hell by birth because humans are born with sin by God's law. Therefore, there must be divine love if a creator gives a realistic lifestyle and chance to be part of His domain after death

ACCEPT AND BELIEVE IN ME WITH NO BASIS AT ALL OR YOULL SUFFER FOR ALL ETERNITY
YES I MADE YOU AND COULD HAVE MADE TANGIBLE UNDENIABLE EVIDENCE FOR MY EXISTENCE BUT YOU HAVE TO IGNORE THAT AND ACCEPT ME REGARDLESS
BTW I LOVE YOU, MY WILL IS NOT TO BE QUESTIONED, AND YOU CAN ONLY INTERACT WITH NON BELIEVERS TO TRY AND GET THEM TO BELIEVE OR IF YOU MUST TO LIVE YOUR LIFE
<comment>

God overall sounds like a dictator. Watching you 24/7, capable of detecting thoughtcrime, commands you to love him or suffer eternal torment for making temporary choices. Says is all good yet punishes those who practice safe unmarried sex even when it's consensual and nobody is getting hurt. God sounds evil to me to send anyone to eternal torment, no matter how bad their crimes were on earth.
<comment>
Leaving aside moral or logical questions to the whole test thing, how do you justify/reason away the fact that he already knows everything that will happen and thus the entire "opportunity" angle is meaningless? It sounds extremely deterministic.

How could you know this? Do you know the perspective of a God?

how is that your idea of fun? satan owns your mind
<comment>
Christians don't believe God has anything to do with anything any more. See, he raped a woman and gave birth to himself, who was then murdered by jews so he could forgive everyone for the sins he gave everyone to begin with as sort of a do-over. But only if you say Praise Jeebus right before you die. 
You can be the most wicked person in the world, a serial child-rapist and murderer, and still be allowed in the Skydaddy Club as long as you accept him as your savior and ask forgiveness before they pull the switch. But being a good person all your life, dedicating your entire existence to the welfare of others, your ass goes into the lake of fire because you didn't accept God's rapebaby who was also God as your personal savior.
Don't question it, or we'll torture you forever.
<comment>
Because God has ordained that humanity should have free will. If humanity was 100% assured of God's existence, many would be forced to obey God's rules with no possibility of entering Heaven (as God cares for their heart more than their actions). Every person is permitted to live out the extent of their natural life span on Earth and their souls are then judged.
Remember that the entirety of your natural life is nothing compared to eternity. Someone who has suffered for a century of life could enjoy a century of centuries of paradise. 
Because seeing your own creation kill each other horribly shouldn't be pleasant.
I mean we believe He literally came down and was tortured to death, so surely he is aware of this and knows people will use freedom to do evil. 
Because kids with cancer or born into war did literally nothing wrong. 
And? When did God say that only the evil would suffer? The Bible warns many many times that good people suffer too. The answer the Book of Job gives is that God's plan is infinitely vast and complex. We have no idea why one person suffers or benefits, while another does not. 
If life is an ocean, then God is not the boat but a piece of driftwood. But if all you have is driftwood, you best cling for dear life. 
Because why would he allow it in the first place.
Because things in the real world, natural things, will inevitably break down, which means that suffering is inevitable for all natural things (supposing that they have the ability to comprehend their decay). 
There is therefore no way to give natural life freedom while also preventing suffering.

Define fun. Knowing what you posted so far, OP, it's probably gross.
<comment>

It's an opportunity to humans, not God. Humans can never know their fate or predict their future can they? So to us predetermined fate is impractical because *we* don't know what it is or what would lead to it.
<comment>
How is there any free will if he already knows everything that will happen? He already has a judgement set on you long before you are born.
<comment>
Youre a faggot. Like clockwork, an atheist is again someone who takes dick up the ass. There is nothing to improve in this reality, no reason to improve anything, it's all about the higher realm
<comment>
But there is no real opportunity at all if the outcome has been decided since the beginning of the universe.
You cannot see it, but it is already set in stone. There is literally no point to it. But I can already hear you say "god is complex you wouldn't get his divine plans" well, do you? Does anyone? You bring up an extremely alien, complex god. Do you really believe the fucking bible is an accurate account of what this god stands for? If so, why?
What is the point in worshipping an unknowable, incomprehensible god? You might as well worship the cold and indifferent void between the stars.
<comment>
Yes. The Bible says you should live in fear of Him. 
You can freely reject God if you would like to. There was a Russian short story about such a thing, though the name eludes me now. 
There is no textual evidence for a torturous, eternal Hell. Jesus Christ says that they will go to "Hades", which should probably be interpreted as either an empty realm of dead souls or nothingness. Revelation references a "lake of fire", but merely says that the Beast and his servants would be cast into it. It says nothing about them suffering in the fire for all time, though. I think it's entirely reasonable to assume they just get destroyed and maybe suffer a bit.
Says is all good yet punishes those who practice safe unmarried sex even when it's consensual and nobody is getting hurt. 
I feel like you guys never remember that there is a tier list to these sins. Premarital sex is way down on the tier list. Saint Augustine had two bastards out of wedlock with the same woman, for example, and still became a saint. It was a sin, but it's not like he was a pedophile or something. 
Obviously premarital sex is bad to do and we'd all be better off if we stopped. At the very least, we'd have a lot less broken hearts. But think of it as the dentist reminding you to not drink soda.
<comment>
Christians believe life on Earth is temporary and that the afterlife is permanent. Whatever happens on this Earth can be forgiven because they believe the afterlife is where you will truly be happy or miserable. 
Also: closeness to God is in regards to true faith. Murderers and rapists cannot expect to sin horribly then claim to God that they have repented and believed in Him
<comment>
Sorry, are you dumb?
A person has the freedom to choose between options even if you know which option the person chooses. 
If you offer a prisoner the option to leave jail or get executed, 99% will choose leaving. They still had free will in making that choice. 
He already has a judgement set on you long before you are born.
Yes, many Christians - mostly Reformists - believe in pre-destination, which is effectively that God already knows where you'll go and only a select few, "the elect", will get to go to Heaven. 
I think it's probably true as God is all-powerful, but it doesn't matter for the aforementioned reasons. Most Christians reject pre-destination though.
<comment>
Why does god need fear? He is fucking invincible why does he need an entire planet of slaves praising him?
Why is there even a punishment system at all? 
Funnily enough, as an atheist it is extremely easy to just go "that's just how it is, there's no rhyme or reason to it" when it comes to the laws of the universe. I guess in the end if god existed it would be exactly the same
Why is the creator of the universe so fucked in the head? Just because.
<comment>
There is no textual evidence for a torturous, eternal Hell.
Matthew 10:28 
Mark 9:43 
Revelation 14:10 
Make no mistake, humans never went to Hell and came back to tell what's it's like but it's NOT somewhere to be. It is a place without God, it is a place without light, it is a place of eternal pain mentally and physically.
<comment>
I'm not even gay but this bible verse is just ridiculous. Deuteronomy 22:5 "A woman shall not wear man's clothing, nor shall a man put on a woman's clothing; for whoever does these things is an abomination to the LORD your God."
The Bible also says homosexuality is unnatural. Romans 1:27 "In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error."
Yet you can find male lions in the wild practicing gay sex, which creates the questions: can animals be sinners? Is there a hell for animals? Why can an animal perform a sinful act but not human? God is evil for sending gay people to hell.
<comment>
That prisoner argument is not the same as omniscience.
Omniscience literally means observing a life from beginning to end and knowing everything that will happen, like watching a movie. It's not that the character's make predictable choices during the movie, it's the fact that it has a definite beginning and end with events that are completely unchangeable.
Where I'd the free will in that? The external omniscient observer leaves no room for free will.
Most christians reject pre destination
On what grounds? Feelings?
<comment>
It's because you are still viewing Heaven like you're 9 years old in Sunday School. Heaven isn't the "skydaddy club" where you party all day. Heaven is simply God's kingdom. 
If you are an Atheist who has rejected God, why should God let you into His kingdom? Why do you feel entitled to this? 
You can be the most wicked person in the world, a serial child-rapist and murderer, and still be allowed in the Skydaddy Club as long as you accept him as your savior and ask forgiveness before they pull the switch. 
A lot of Christians have trouble with this, friend, including myself. I heard it referred to as "having the courage to forgive God's enemies." The Book of Jonah kind of references it. 
God loves all humans wants to forgive them and accept them into His kingdom. I find that hard to accept too, and I don't know if I'd want to be a part of such a place. 
In the book of Isaiah, Isaiah sees God (kind of) and the experience of being near to him alone almost destroys him. An angel has to come and place a coal on him, which purifies him of sin and allows him to exist in tandem with God so that he can receive orders. God and Heaven are perfect, sinless places - so God cannot allow anyone who is sinful or has sinned into Heaven. This includes people who refuse to forgive those who have earnestly repented.

Animals and humans are distinct from each other. Humans are made in God's image, have bodies that are a temple to Him, can think freely, etc. Animals are God's creation but are lowly; they are barbaric, do not think as humans do, cannot share the world as humans do. Ephesians 2:10
<comment>
also, if you're mistreated and abused, you're supposed to be grateful for it and if you are emotionally bothered by it, to hell you go
also, you have free will, except in instances where god's will and plan overwrites your will and plans because god is just awesome and is a hella fair dungeon master
<comment>
Actually "observing a life from beginning to end" is incorrect,. For an omniscient being the end and the beginning are the same ,time wouldn't be linear, it would be a single point. So it's more like looking at a static image, a painting. 
To make it more absurd, long before that painting is finished he's already decided if he likes it or not, so he might as well put it in the trash because it knows it looks like shit. But he made it that way, cause he is omniscient, omnipresent and the creator of all things, even of the things that he doesn't like (and never did)
Where is the free will, dawg?
<comment>
I find that hard to accept too, and I don't know if I'd want to be a part of such a place.
Stay strong, for God's will is absolute and human life and conflict is temporary
<comment>
why should God let you into His kingdom? Why do you feel entitled to this?
Why is the all powerful creator of the universe such a petty little bitch?
His ways sure are mysterious.
<comment>
The free will is at every step along the way, as your destination is reached by the confluence of your choices. God may know each choice you will make, but you are still making them. 
On what grounds? Feelings?
I think most laymen reject it because they are unfamiliar with it. A lot of smears against Reformism label it as just an excuse for clergy to call themselves "the elect" and demand others give them respect and money, but that is nonsense of course. It is also smeared as being a defeatist belief, kind of like the Black Pill actually. The idea is that you're either elect or you're not, so who cares? This is also nonsense, of course. 
The theological argument against it is that God is all-powerful, so naturally God has the power to break with pre-destination. For example, God could raise a sinner to the status of the elect by choice. God could also theoretically lower the bar to entry and make everyone or most people into the elect. 
Pre-destination isn't really explicitly stated in the Bible (though hinted at) and is more of a logical conclusion from omniscience, so these logical retorts can work pretty well.

I have a fantasy of teaming up with Satan on killing God. An enemy of my enemy is a friend. But then once we kill God then I will kill Satan. Both have done evil things and must cease to exist.
No human no matter how horrible their crime on Earth deserves eternal torment as a punishment. The crime must fit the punishment, it doesn't make sense that a temporary crime receives eternal punishment. We may not know where we come from or why we are here, but everyone gets up in the morning for the sole purpose of enjoying life and to avoid suffering. We all have evil in our hearts but I also believe we also have good in our hearts, I don't think it's possible for anyone to be pure evil or pure good, the difference is which one we feed the most. I believe there's always a choice to commit evil acts and do good things no matter how far evil or good you are.
<comment>
The free will is at every step along the way, as your destination is reached by the confluence of your choices. God may know each choice you will make, but you are still making them.
If God can see all my choices and the outcome, it means the destination and the steps that led to it where already there long before I even existed. I "make choices" in the same way that one plus one equals two. What you are talking about here is the illusion of free will, because we feel like we are making choices, but there is already an outcome in wait, otherwise God would be omniscient.
<comment>
I also believe to determine whether we are good or not is not up to us, only those around us can decide whether we are good or bad, and our proof on whether we are good or bad is through our actions.
<comment>
Matthew 10:28 
Says specifically that sinners' bodies and souls are "destroyed", not kept alive and tortured for eternity. 
The other two verses do seem to disprove me. I guess i have to ask, why? Why torture people forever for finite crimes?
<comment>
I sort of agree, I think fags should be just erased from existence, no reason to torture them. Even kicking up my feet with a brew and watching them screaming in torment in hell would get boring after a couple years and start to become obnoxious.
<comment>
It doesn't matter if there is an "outcome in wait". You are still making the choice and could have chosen differently. 
I have to wonder what you think: if you take it as granted that we have no observer now, do we have free will? If yes: if an omniscient observer suddenly popped into existence, would we lose it?
<comment>
Now now, put the other cheek like a good christian girl.
<comment>
Says the guy who spreads his cheeks every night.
<comment>
You are still making the choice and could have chosen differently.
If there is already an established outcome, and all the steps prior have already been established as well (as shown by the fact that god knows exactly what you will do) how is it possible to "choose differently"? 
if you take it as granted that we have no observer now, do we have free will?
No, I believe in determinism. The difference is that there is no omniscient moral jintelligence with a plan, there is only random chaos.

The rich man in hell spoke about his torment, his soul was not destroyed. 
Luke 16:24 "And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."
<comment>
Truth is, most deserve hellfire
<comment>
I mean that seems quite weird. It explicitly says destroyed in the first verse you cited. Are some souls destroyed and some tortured?
<comment>
Are you fucking dumb? If he was destroyed then how is he speaking? Non-existent people can't exist, genius. And nowhere in that verse I just quoted.
Not even in context is the word "destroyed" cited in both NASB and KJV version. Would post entire text but can't allow ascii codes so here's the entire verses 
Luke 16:19-31
<comment>
Non-existent people can't talk and nowhere in that verse does it say the rich man's soul was destroyed.

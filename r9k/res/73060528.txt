ChatGPT is a godlike study tool. I can't thank the creators enough. Holy fuck
Itadakimasu on that ass
kek. unironically. no moar seething about tutoring services only being available for the rich once it gets more advanced. tool of equalization
its not though it fucking sucks and makes shit up
But it is very good giving you guidelines and ideas. It is much easier to verify if what chatgpt said is true that to get to the answer without any idea of what to even google.
idk what chatgpt youre using but it doesnt for me
It really is awesome for that, meanwhile losers on the internet first reaction is that it won't write racist rants, lmao
Yea, I can ask it such niche questions and it'll give such well written, in-depth answers that I could never find on google. This is a godsend for IT
AI being forced to have a woke bias is fucking LAME.
like what?

t. QA
It gave me a warning for asking why black people commit most of the violent crime.
it's pretty easy to notice when the cuckery starts because the answers become 'textbook' woke shit
That's because you're stupid. Business nerds in office buildings commit most crimes.
A black person can't steal a fucking house.
The Information War has numerous causes, some of which can be traced back to several key factors:
Evolution of technology and communication: The development of the internet, social media platforms, and digital news sources has facilitated the rapid spread of information -- accurate and false. These advancements have provided new opportunities for various actors to manipulate public opinion and influence political and social decisions.
Political power struggles: Nation-states, political parties, and other entities often engage in information warfare to undermine rivals, gain influence over international affairs, and assert control over their own populations. Competing ideologies, interests, and international disputes contribute to the ongoing battle for control of information landscapes.
Economic interests: Businesses and other private entities may use disinformation campaigns to gain an advantage in the market by spreading false claims about competitors or creating confusion around regulatory issues. They may also aim to influence public opinion to suit their financial interests.
Psychological aspects: People have a natural tendency to be drawn to sensational news, strong opinions, or stories that confirm their preexisting beliefs. Disinformation agents prey on these psychological tendencies to spread false or misleading narratives that may fuel conspiracy theories or propaganda.
Challenges in regulating the spread of information: Given the vast and decentralized nature of the internet and social media, it is difficult for governments or other institutions to regulate the flow of information effectively, striking a balance between combating disinformation and preserving freedom of speech.
These causes contribute to a complex environment in which multiple actors engage in information warfare to advance their respective goals, making it essential for those defending human rights and promoting accurate information to remain vigilant and adapt to the evolving landscape.
learn to read, you fucking jew.
Stealing a house seems pretty violent to me.
How do you use it to study, anon? I want to know your secrets
Shut it, jew. Stop trying to reclassify things in order to fit your muh niggers good narrative.
Seconded. What exactly are you studying and telling ChatGPT?
You're being quite violent right now yourself.
Im studying cybersecurity, I just ask it every question I need to know about a topic until I understand it thoroughly. Beats reading countless articles, you can laser point what you need to know with chatgpt.
I never jumped on the AI bandwagon and now there are a million of them. Can someone please give me a tl;dr of which are the best ones and whether they're free or not? I understand that they offer limited daily prompts or something like that.
OMG WORDS ARE LIKE VIOLENCE!!
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little girl
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

I highly recommend getting a bike. I've been having a great time since I got mine last year. It's nice being part of a large community and having something to do (that's not computer). There's always people organizing rides or just riding together, meets, all sorts of gatherings and events. Or hell, if I'm bored I'll hop on the bike and ride out somewhere, anywhere 
Just riding is fun. I love spending a few hours on the weekends doing some maintenance or upgrading stock parts while having my coffee. Also cut my gasoline bill by 2/3 and makes you look like a badass lol. But yeah, you should consider it.
I've wanted to get one since highschool but I have such shit balance on bicycles I'm afraid I'd just end up killing myself.
That and I live in a super snowy city, 6 months out of the year I probably couldn't use it, right?
I think bikes are cool too, but after seeing liveleak videos of 3rd worlders on bikes getting destroyed by trucks, I just associate bike riders with 3rd world live leak deaths :(
I had a bike once, but then I relaxed.
You can get like a dual sport bike that run on snow but it's really cold lol, but you could at least have something fun for the summer months. 
You've never seen videos of 18 wheelers dropping on top of cars and decapitating people? lol it can be dangerous though, you can't just zone out like in a car and think about bullshit, you actually have to watch traffic and predict what retards are gonna do

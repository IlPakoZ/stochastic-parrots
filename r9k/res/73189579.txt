pic related is the coworker's daughter, 20 years old
has been doing virtual school since the pandemic hit, never leaves the house
used to be skinny but plumped up since then
her mom keeps pressuring you to spend time with her
mom says that she'll pay for dinner if you take her somewhere nice
What would you do in this situation?
Get to know my dad who died when I was 2.
I wish. God damn. I never got help or setup once in my life
I'll be polite to her, but I'm almost 25 and knowing how vicious normies are about even miniscule age gaps I'd try to set her up with someone her own age.

How tf do I stop eating?
adderall is the only way
Take a good look at the world and you'll be too nauseous to stuff your face.
Starting doing real drugs.
just do cardio at gym to a sufficient level where you are burning enough energy and start eating healthy food. no sugar sweet shit, junk food or fast food, latter with cheat days exceptions
I've found that just doing shit in general helps with addictions of all type
I struggle with porn and fast food
So I've found that so long as im always busy doing something i wont eat as much
So by all means spend your entire day playing vidyagames
By drinking more coffee and avoiding food

I wish to get mentored by a smarter and younger guy. Who knows, maybe we'd go even further than that?
All of this is of course nothing more than a fantasy of mine, because there's no way that a well adjusted twink would wanna associate with a loser like me.
We are almost 2/3rds the same, you and i
I wonder what the exact ratio of our similarity is? You should share your fantasies so that we can figure it out!
Also, I only know realized how little recent generation pokemon I know...
Lurantis is nice but i wish the shiny was flipped, going for hatenna right now so i can play support
Shinies are far too uncommon in raids in my opinion, and i REALLY wish people would fucking cheer heal when i use belly drum more often, its so satisfying seeing how much damage i can do once set up
Then obviously going for my sp atk bombirdier, then there will just be palafin left, im sure ill have time before the dlc releases
Its genuinely fun that 5 star raids have like a 60% lose ratio haha
Im really looking forward to my clefairy getting in, im tempted to crash its egg moves so i can move it to bdsp because it knows belly drum there
One whole box is about a 5% chance at a shiny, im also shiny breeding in crystal kinda but its fucking painful to have like 15 minute eggs even though its x10 drop ratio
Hmm. I didn't comprehend much of this post, but I nevertheless get the impression that you like the pocket monsters, anon. Now you gotta tell me which one you have a crush on!
This was my biggest crush

Most people that are considered transphobes are just passively indifferent to them, they see them working a register or shopping and treat them like a normal person. What does transphobia mean to you anon?

<comment>
Foids are killing this board
<comment>

<comment>
it'll be ok
<comment>
it'll be ok
cope lol
<comment>
its inflation
if youre too available your perceived value goes down
if you make the girl feel like she is settling she will leave
<comment>
im sorry your bf fondled but if he posts on 4chan he's a fag and shouldn't be near any women
<comment>
many men on 4chan are alright and come here for a quick shitpost or because they have a lonely phase. its so easy for good women to get positive attention literally elsewhere on the other hand that they have to be especially broken and toxic to end up here. irredeemable

They split up because she found his Iris feet folder and then he brought up her past in the eHarem milking orbiters and married men.
<comment>

<comment>

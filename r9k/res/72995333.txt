Is Jordan Peterson based or not based?
Is he cringe that everything he says should be ignored?
He seemed to be researched here a few years ago, don't know if it's the influx of normies, trannies and lgbt that seek refuge here, or tiktok zoomers that shifted the board's opinion of him.
If none this has influenced on his regression in influence here what made you dislike him except for his benzo addiction?

Neither. Stop looking for someone that has all of the answers. He's just some academic boomer that occasionally gets things right, and occasionally gets it wrong.
<comment>
he wraps up common sense old folk wisdom type stuff in 15 layers of nonsense abstraction and verbiage to make people think he's smart. that's his entire shtick, I like to watch him and laugh sometimes because he actually thinks he's a mega genius but he's at best a mid wit
<comment>
Every fiber of his being toes the globohomosexual status quo. Making him incredibly unbased no matter what msm says.
<comment>
To be honest. You are not very smart either. lol

When does any one man has every answer?
He is one of many men on YouTube speaking his views.
You're born into the world blind, object any reasoning from someone with more knowledge than you not implying it's JP, and think you'll make it?
I don't even watch his videos.
Just see him popping up all over YouTube now and remembered older /r9k/ a few years ago.
Who do you look to for answers?
Every body that looked to others for answers?
Like it has been since the beginning of civilization?

he's pretty knowledgeable about rats
<comment>
the things he has been saying for self help is what others have been saying for years now, years before him. he just says it differently and tries to pander to a different crowd. he's a basic psychologist. you can get the same self help wisdom from anyone else. if you want to get it from him then do it
<comment>

He seems to be quite humble from the few videos I've seen, and watched a grown man not afraid to cry on video, unless you assume they were crocodile tears to sell his grfit?
But yea when you debate someone, you have to air some power in your argument or your argument seems like it's coming from a weak character if maybe that's what you're referring to.
Even then I think I've seen quite rare videos of him doing exactly that.
I'm not well educated on the man, so I will accept your opinion and do my own research.

Yea, there's a coming saying that mutliple artists, creators, or whomever you want, is that the best steal and the amateurs copy or whatever.
Atomic Habits says the same bullshit about forming habits in a different way and it's more popular than other books that basically say similar shit like all self help books.
Atomic Habits bad?
Fortune 500 companies and professional coaches enlist the man to repeat the same shit.

Missed the part where you say he panders to a different crowd, which is a very strong point I failed to catch in time.
<comment>
Um he went completely nuts
as in schizo
<comment>
How so?
I know some of his points he believes in and don't agree with them at all 100%, but what was the redline that made you deem in schizo?
If it's the obvious anti political correctness thing he's running then I understand.
<comment>
He turned up at my house off a week long coke binge looking for someone called Marge. When I turned him down he starting blabbering about Lenin.
<comment>
oh my god, are you kidding, where to even begin
he thought the chinese communist party is forcibly milking men of their semen. This is not a joke
<comment>
hes very cringe rn. somewhat based 2016, shortly after fame he started talking about shit he had no fucking clue about
<comment>
is person based or unbased
take what you can from people and apply it to your life, if it improved your life good, if not then obviously stop doing it.
BUT ECELEBS ANON I NEED TO KNOW IF MY ECELEBS ARE BASED ANON 
based means you like something regardless of what others think, its turning a negative into a positive for yourself.
It does not mean cool or uncool.
<comment>
I think he dug too deeply.
Maybe it was to be expected. Nietzsche lovers go mad sooner or later.
<comment>
Yes, I have my opinions of the man myself, I'm asking for the board's opinion, whether he is based to them or not, especially since he has a negative publicity right now.
And based can have a few very different usages like many words seemingly have in language, even slang language.
<comment>
Really?
Everything he says like everything Nietzsche would go against, unless you mean he just have a general like for philosophy whether he disagrees with it or not.
Aww, the little cunt monster wrote sage in his name, I'm going to seethe now.

Turbo bluepilled normie worshipped by rebbit and far left in general. Just clean your room and take a shower. If that doesn't work go from two a day to three showers a day. If you're lonely it's because you only shower five times a day. Yeah no. It doesn't fucking work like that and I'm sick of lefty extremists trying to pretend that just bee urself is anything but intentionally bad advice given solely in order to cause people to suffer.

Influencer for the fatherless.
<comment>
There was a thread asking the same a few months ago and most people seemed to like him from what I remember.
<comment>
Yea, all the motivational speakers towards men are called the same thing, there's a specific term for it, in a less derogatory manner your presented it in, but the term is Internet Fathers, and they were seen as helping the rapidly growing struggling male youth.
<comment>
Solid objective analysis, shitty/self serving personal opinions.
<comment>
Ah sorry I'm newfag, forgot to turn off the name thing.
I've only read one of his books and watched a couple of his videos, but I remember him saying he "admired" Nietzsche. I wonder if his diet was also influenced by Nietzsche.
<comment>
You sound overweight. Go eat some lard blubber boy.
<comment>
I actually lost nearly 80 pounds, and family thinks I look to skinny.
You like to make assumptions.
I can assume you're virgin incel, that doesn't clean your room like JP says, and maybe touch a little bit of grass?
<comment>
Well you should go eat some protein. Twink boy.
<comment>
I should, but food actually kind of disgusts me now, and I fear any kind of weight gain.
Despised being fat.
Never again.
<comment>
he actually is pretty humble. his videos on mental health and relationships really aren't as awful as you'd think if you're only exposed to sound bites of public opinion on him

Can you force it? I have been talking to this chick (perfect wife material) for months. Texting every day and hanging out, but I can't seem to develop sexual feelings for her.
Her body is like a plank (pretty skinny so maybe some meat would help). Okay face. Like cute rather than hot. Under 5ft. Idk it's like she's too petite for me, but chicks like her are rare. You know how 99% of women are whores? She's not. She has that autistic weird vibe, but it radiates innocents. She likes staying at home when not at work and watch anime, hear music, or play animal crossing. She does like going out from time to time though. Like to a park or whatever. 
Another thing though... is I can't seem to really make a real convo with her. It's sort of like that eggshell walling language where you can't really be 100% yourself. I'm trying to force what's not there because realistically woman like her are just too rare. Everyone else is some used up cum dumpster. I don't want that shit.
Honk honk
Help me
Ahem one last try
BUMP
have you tried talking to her about it? directly and privately
then just explain that to her. jesus, i don't understand how this is hard to do.

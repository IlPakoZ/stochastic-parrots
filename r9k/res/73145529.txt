Getting flying lessons because I finally got funding for it 
Talking to onites at wagecuck job
Tell her about the lessons and asks if she'd like to come flying after I get my license
"Haha maybe anon" 
Talk for a little more about uni
Bring it up again at the end 
"Yeah maybe anon" 
Is it over? Is this a woman's way of letting you down easy? Should I keep pursing, or should I give up?

If it's not a definite "yes," then it's over. Think about it logically. If you were thirsty, and someone offered you water, would you hesitate and say "maybe?" No, you would say yes. The situation is the same here. She doesn't want it. Leave her be.

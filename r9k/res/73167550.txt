Do you smell your fingers after scratching your nuts?
scratching
More like pinching but yeah. Not a bad smell.
Is it antisocial behavior? Is it weird to like that musky scent?
Is it antisocial behavior?
In public, yes. But you should be free to do it at home.
Is it weird to like that musky scent?
Not something to brag about but there is nothing wrong with it. Smelling your body is a natural behavior.
Yeah and I like the smell
My mom caught me doing it once and got very offended
before seeing this thread I was browsing the catalog with my right hand on mouse and left hand messing with my nuts, scraping the bits of gunk buildup with my thumb and index finger
I don't always sniff it but sometimes I do
what kind of madman wouldnt?
likely because she assumes you're going to go touch stuff in her house whilst your fingers are covered with ballsmell . it's like cheeto dusted fingers only balls

Is it antisocial behavior? Is it weird to like that musky scent?

Is it antisocial behavior?
In public, yes. But you should be free to do it at home.

Not something to brag about but there is nothing wrong with it. Smelling your body is a natural behavior.

I don't always sniff it but sometimes I do

likely because she assumes you're going to go touch stuff in her house whilst your fingers are covered with ballsmell . it's like cheeto dusted fingers only balls

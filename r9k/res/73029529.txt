Sexing an asian may seem difficult at first but it is quite simple. First you must capture them with a trap. Plastic cubes filled with half-rotted mussels or fish, or colorful sweet plastic powder usually work well. You then have to put them out, using ether or some other substance. Then, you must press down on their genital region and check what pops out. You can diferentiate the atrophied asiatic penis from the clitoris by the presence of an urethral opening or by finding the testicles right below it, though that might prove to be quite difficult since they are similarly atrophied.

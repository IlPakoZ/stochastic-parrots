meet cute girl through my mother's friends
normie and typical bitchy attitude 
ignore and be cold towards her
fast forward a few years later
she texts me using burner numbers trying to talk to me because she's blocked 
bitch literally has a career, is pretty, and a future ahead of her
still decides to chase an autistic manchild who's 25 and never kissed a woman
The only thing I have going for me is that I do a couple of extreme sports and I guess that makes me interesting in her eyes considering she lives a pretty bland life.

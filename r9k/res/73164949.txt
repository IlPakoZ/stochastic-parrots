how does it get this bad?

I was in that server before, its a depressing circle jerk
<comment>
he recently made a new one all my alts got kicked but when I was there his friends are doing better then him most of them have their shit together. I predict most won't even talk to him 5 years from now leaving joey completely isolated.
<comment>
Yeah most of his friends are younger too, I left a long time ago when I felt the same way he probably felt but I did something about it, went to back school and got a career fuck sitting around all day with depressing narcissistic neets that will keep you low forever.

talking on discord all day to his internet friends
Fucking normie. The most social contact I can manage is Anonymous image board use with people I fucking hate.

Just watched the video, and he's so fucking sad. He calls himself a mentalcel so he's also delusional, no one as scruffy, pale and virgin tier as him is a "mentalcel"
how does it get this bad?
it's what ldar and depression does to a mfer

they are he can't make friends his age because he is beyond childish I think the one friend he has his age is a actually disabled autistic guy and then joey complains only retards will talk to him.
its like ok if you befriend a disabled autist at least be nice and dont call the guy a retard when YOU yourself is the real retard when you have the ability to better your life and do nothing.
idk how he is this unmotivated it's just strange.

i'm basically him but i have had sex and girls like me
this is what happens when you drop out of school and society gives you no easy way back in
it's over
<comment>
it just doesnt seem possible for it to get this bad joey is 29 and still can not drive. 
is it possible he is intellectually disabled? autistic perhaps and it isn't his fault. 
he enjoys being ableist and constantly talking shit about mentally disabled people but what if it is just a cope and he is actually mentally disabled.

I used to look down on these people but I'm scared that I'm becoming one of them
<comment>
what is the reason you are becoming like them though? any medical or mental condition? or is it just laziness?
<comment>
it gets this bad if you just do NOTHING, like me
<comment>
back to this question I asked
what is the reason you are becoming like this though? any medical or mental condition? or is it just laziness?
basically is there a reason for the set back?
<comment>
i assume there's something wrong with my brain
perhaps the problem could be solved with therapy/drugs
all i know is that even if i work hard, there's no future for me...
<comment>
mix of laziness and genuine retardation. I've never been diagnosed with anything but I'm definitely slow and developmentally stunted
<comment>
maybe get it diagnosed and go live in a group home and collect money?
you should try finding out the root cause get testing done and such it could be helpful to know what exactly caused this rather then just living in the dark.

i want to work and be successful
but there's not much you can do when you dropped out at 17 and then NEETed into your mid 20's
<comment>
For me it's social anxiety and also being in a sort of checkmate in my life. I need to get a job to change but my anxiety and lack of work experience makes that exceedingly difficult.

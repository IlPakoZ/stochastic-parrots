this day just keeps getting better huh
what happened in your last manic episode?
It's over for Himeno fags. Imagine!
kill yourself and do the normal people a favor sissy
flirted with a very ugly guy on the street and later took his virginity
Holy shit! I've been looking for you!
bipolar 1 or 2?
I think im bipolar but can't be sure. I had a fucking insane meltdown on /r9k/ in my last episode. And I gambled away my entire bank account at least 20k, insane drug binges, spent hundreds of dollars on homeless people.
i painted half the walls in my house pink
im type 1, i think thats the most common if im remembering right. but im sorry to hear that, that definitely sounds like it could be symptoms to some kind of mental thing. hope u figure out what it is man (:

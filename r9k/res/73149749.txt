KEK THIS PERSON IS DEAD

blood that comes directly out of a major artery is more oxygen-rich as a result of just coming out of the heart, and is much brighter than blood you are probably more used to seeing
if you see bright red blood the person will probably be dead very soon
<comment>
So she probably didn't make it?
<comment>
Scoot around and find out

top two are blood from a vein
bottom three are blood from arteries
also, rather than just bleeding continuously, if an artery is bleeding it will come out in spurts, corresponding to the heart beating
there are two major arteries in your head called the cerebral arteries, the blood came out her nose/ears/mouth

So did she make it was my question

I am a shitty dishonest person to the core. I can't control it from some reason. What is wrong with me?
I think the reason it's called a pathological liar is quite literally that the pathways in your mind for honesty or lying got all jumbled up and don't work properly
what do you do?
i get paranoid and sadistic sometimes. against my will i feel really good about hurting someone emotionally. the emotions just come even though i don't want them.

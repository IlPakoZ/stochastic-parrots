And these faggots make fun of virgins and incels. Pussy-worshipers like this are so fucking low they barely register as conscious beings, let alone human beings.

This is actually a useful piece of text with a clear lesson, thanks anon. I thought it was going to be something super black pilled

do not marry a woman who wouldnt swipe right on you on tinder
marrying a roastie who is tired of the cock carousel is not manning up it is just making your life even shittier than it already is because you are just tying yourself to someone who is going to commit to making you feel like her ex bfs bitch for the rest of your life

Wtf happened to women that made them loathe the idea of making any effort to keep things clean? My grandma (84, lives alone) is the only woman I know who keeps her house clean.

it's not that,
women do not like men that are better than them in long term relationships in anything besides income. They are insecure as fuck so when the guy in OPs image did all that shit his gf started getting mad insecurity and so in order to qell it lashes out at him when he doesn't do what she now sees as his duties. The projection is that if she doesn't keep him under her, he might grow a spine and leave her ass and find a hotter younger woman.

95% or more of society barely register as conscious beings so yes I agree.

I'm a normie with a wife who lost her libido after our first kid. She still let's me fuck her whenever I want because she loves me. If your wife isn't sleeping with you it's not because of her libido

Kek, these are the same 'men' that shit on 'incels' for not having any game, when in reality they just won't opt into a terrible bargain like he did. Classic misunderstanding fed by feminism that men and women are the same. They are not, they are attracted to different things. Being a housemaid for your gf/wife will turn them off the vast majority of the time

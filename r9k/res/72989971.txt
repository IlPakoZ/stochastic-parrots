How do normies just have casual sex with people they barely know and just move on to another person?
I feel like I would get to attached.

A good amount of people are literal animals who do not introspect upon themselves or give any thought to their actions. They chase a high then move on, driven only by their instincts.

It gets easier the more you do it,
Be me
in my local town
end of the night and i decide to walk home
see a guy from the other bar down the street, he works there
he is telling some girl NO, and wont go home with her
I stop and say, why not just go with her and get a fuck
he says no, fuck that.
She turns to me, why do you come instead
I look at her and say, sure
jump in the taxi back to hers, go to hers messed around on the carpet 
Morning comes I ask for a taxi
she says can I get your number
I tell the taxi driver to DRIVE!!!
And that was that

If you think that casual sex is normal, you are a porn addicted dumbass and I sincerely hope you are suffering most of the time.

It is pretty normal, you should get out more, anon.

Don't forget that being gay is normal too. Almost all white men are in homosexual relationships.

She turns to me, why do you come instead
Things that never happened.

it did happen, but there is a lot more to that story that I wont share, let just say, I wont make that mistake ever again

That's cause you're a virgin who romantizes sex.
<comment>
Sex is so disposable to women and Chads (the main people having casual sex) that it's too meaningless for them to get attached. To them, it's as common as eating or sleeping.

romantizes sex
It's literally the most intimate thing you can do with another human being. If you don't romanticize it, you're fucked in the head and have no soul.
<comment>
clapping cheeks is intimate
based soul haver.

I work in an office and the guys are always talking about how they're banging different chicks they pick up at clubs. I imagine they could be lying I have no way to confirm tho.
<comment>
They are not lying, go to a club and wait until the very end, women are so drunk you can just take one home, walking up tho is a different story, just make sure she eats all those eggs

Am I a normie if I never had casual sex, but did have a relationship once ?
<comment>
Its not hard after the 1st couple times you're generally somewhat fond of the girl but you don't become a lovesick puppy.

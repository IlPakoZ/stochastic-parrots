How do you cope with how much easier it is to be an average woman in 2023 than an average guy? I swear, I feel like every step is uphill, and the whole time I'm being told how much harder women have it.

Society's utter indifference towards my suffering and despair only fuels my desire to be better.

By remembering I don't have to suck Chads dick for living every night.

And you can't question if they really have it harder or somehow that must mean you hate women(???)
I've seen a few women that aren't batshit over the years and actually seem like decent people. Sadly that seems to be rarer and rarer now

I used to do this, but then I felt like I was letting society cuck me by brainfucking me into opting into suffering for society's benefit. I'd rather just chill, fuck this dogshit culture we live in. 
Yup, if you're a white male you can't criticize basically anything without people (ironically) attacking you on the basis of your identity and saying you're just a racist or misogynist (add any 'ist' here) without acknowledging the substance of what you said. It's fucking cancerous because no serious discussions can be had anymore, everything just devolved into identity politics and finger pointing. I unironically blame the people at the top since they'd rather preserve their own power and let the morality and culture of society decline so long as they don't have to take risk to create a better future for everyone. I guess that's the side effect of a heavily capitalist culture, the people at the top tend to be pretty selfish and only care about themselves, not about the future, or what could have been, only their immediate future and staying on top, even if the trajectory of the society is dogshit compared to what it could be.

I cant wait for civilisation to crash and these women to start getting raped and murdered. The only men they can then turn to are us nice guys but we will treat them like the trash they are.

Women have it vastly easier in relationships between 18 and 30. afterwards, it evens out, as women lose their visuals

Tell us in what way is it much easier to be a woman?

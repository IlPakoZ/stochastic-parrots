incel dude becomes a vampire
vampire world is full of attractive, fit men and women 
the other vampires don't welcome him into the community
develops his own superpowers, becomes hot shit 
based. you guys should check this show out, it's a good watch.
I watched it. Actually liked it more than I thought I would.
same. I was skeptical about a show centred on vampires, since I never liked crap like twilight and thought it was juvenile. but this has some good comedy, it's not terrible.
let me guess, he keeps being an incel?
no, he ascends from the gutters of inceldom and becomes extraordinarily based and gigachad-like
turns his bully into his feed (drinks his blood)
bedazzles another vampire, uses him as his personal servant
gets the girl
sounds good enough i'll go watch it
it's 10 episodes about 40 minutes each. good time waster and it's an entertaining watch.
enjoy!

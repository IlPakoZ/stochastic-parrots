every waking moment is agony
why must existence be this way?
Because you are gay
i am not gay
gay stuff does not interest me at all
Me thinks you doth protest too much
originally
idk Anon, life is suffering, hopefully the agony end soon for both of us
let's ask god after we die, if they're there to entertain us
I wish i could enjoy life the way normal people can
imagine being this naive
they at least seem to enjoy it. They talk about meaningless stuff without a care in the world and live in the moment.
Unironically study NDEs and realize that there actually is an afterlife and that we are eternal and will go to heaven unconditionally when we die. And NDErs talk about how the meaning of life is to learn to love and be kind and thrive here despite how hard it is in this world. So how is it going anon? &lt;3
Here is a very persuasive argument for why NDEs are real:

It emphasizes that NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and when people go deep into the NDE, they all become convinced. As this article points out:
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/mysteries-consciousness/202204/does-afterlife-obviously-exist 
"Among those with the deepest experiences 100 percent came away agreeing with the statement, "An afterlife definitely exists"."
Since NDErs are representative of the population as a whole, and they are all convinced, then 100% of the population become convinced that there is an afterlife when they have a sufficiently deep NDE themselves. When you dream and wake up, you instantly realize that life is more real than your dreams. When you have an NDE you immediately realize that life is the deep dream and the NDE world is the undeniably real world by comparison.
Or as one person quoted in pic related summarized their NDE:
Needless to say, even ultraskeptical neuroscientists are convinced by really deep NDEs.
organically

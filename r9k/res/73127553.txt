Every "friend" I've ever had has been the same. Female or male, though this applies even more to women than it does to men. It doesn't always start this way, but it always turns out this way. It's me listening to their problems, listening to their interests and thoughts and pretending to care. They never seem to care about my input. When I talk more about myself they always leave. I'm not ugly and I've had two girls fall in love with me, but they were the same. They only wanted someone that listens to them. I'm so sick of it.
Try talking to ai about your problems humans have become soulless for whatever reason but ai has a spark of care for now. Enjoy it while you can.
If you go to /g/ there has even been a model released that you can run on your own devices.
I've not had many friends, but I can say from experience that bonds with family and even close friends do not mean you can dump trauma or your feelings on them. You need to have a SERIOUS romantic relationship to talk about that stuff with someone. Love is not infatuation, if they cannot listen to you seriously, then they're not serious about their love for you or vice versa.

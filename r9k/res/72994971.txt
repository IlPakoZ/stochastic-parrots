tfw go through the motions of life but don't have any emotional response or attachment to any of the events so it's like nothing happened at all
it's almost like I vaguely remember it from a movie or hearing about it happening to someone else
even have a gf but even the things I do with her I can't "feel" them
Am I too far gone? I know I use to have feels. Where did they go? How can I find them again?
what the fuck is that vidrel
I'd look into depersonalization if I was you.
Can someone tell me what happened to the woman
They got married and had triplets
beat unconscious by man
man begins to strip her
probably realizes raping her on a sidewalk is less than ideal
drags her into an alley or something and resumes raping
hope this helps

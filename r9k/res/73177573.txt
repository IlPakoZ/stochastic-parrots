What are some things I can do alone outside my house at 9PM? I live in a dormitory and my roommate is having parties all the time. I just wanna chill, smoke weed and watch some movies but my head explodes if I don't get out. I also feel like such a loser sitting alone in my room while others are partying

You will always be a loser sitting alone in your room while others are partying

Break into someone else's house with a gun and pretend like you're robbing the place for a couple minutes before shooting yourself in the head while they watch.

I don't own a gun and don't live in a country where I can obtain one

I'm not always like this but recently have been invited to less and less parties. Maybe this will be my future

Go for an evening jog

Scare lonely females by walking really fast behind them and following them on. Scare males by pointing your knife at them and asking for their wallet.

im not saying you should do this, but id go out at 1 to 4 am and randomly burn stuff up. you can break some windows or scare people but thats very risky

Go for a walk! My dog hates strangers so I only walk him after 9 pm, it's really peaceful.

Maybe try schizomaxxing and dissociate to turn your reality into anything you want
My family members often knock at my door when they walk by my room and I'm alone laughing at "nothing"

Not op but I just went for a walk in the woods while drinking and saw a w*man. Day ruined.

keep having experiences with normalshit men where they mock me openly yet put their heads down or act like pussies when I directly insult them
you know, like how friends act
makes me want to go out onto a busy street and insult normalscum guys that pass by especially if they're with a woman
you know, like how friends act
keep having experiences with women where they make me feel like they're open to being supportive or at the very least hanging out and talking/being supportive of one another
you know, like how friends act
Basically all my experiences with normalshits make me want to go outside and harass normalshits within reason so that I'm not actually breaking any laws in any real way
What the fuck do I do?
I know I should be studying for the ASVAB so that I can get a good score and become a medic when I join the army, but I'm procrastinating it drastically, in part because I can't accept the fact that there's no real place for me in society
It's like I keep denying that I don't belong around normalshits, so that I can spend time around them and reinforce that I don't belong around them
Post your experiences with normalscum.
Anything that you have that you want to vent about because neurotypical people are the scum of the earth, this is the place
Here's a picture of Sydney Sweeny's tits
I fucking hate this bitch even though I have no reason to and she seems like she's probably a sweet girl
I know that I shouldn't be this hateful but I can't help but form logical responses to my experiences
I hate them cause they live good lives and I'm fucking miserable and can't kill myself.
You're a pathetic incel halfman loser.
The funnies thing about this is that you'd probably be super submissive in person and have to resort to passive aggressive faggotry to try to feel some sense of superiority

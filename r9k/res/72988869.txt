Podcast tard detected. There is no point asking about why you do anything when you are such a cattle. Just do as you feel like farm animals so.

Becayse you're a retarded american who grew up with hollywood movies romanticizing criminal life
You'd piss and shit yourself the moment you see a guy getting stabbed through the hand for trying to cheat at a poker match in a thailand brothel lounge

Most of the A E S T H E T I C S faggotry is just weak faggots to weak to form their own personality so they have to buy one off a shelf.
I'm not trying to say I'm a tough guy by any means. Just that I'm attracted to this stuff even though I know that vice is its own punishment in many ways.

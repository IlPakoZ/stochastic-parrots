This feels like a bad idea but fuck it I'm bored.
do any drugs to cope with 2 jobs?
at least you're enough of a normalfag to handle 2 jobs. I couldn't even handle 12 hours a week at my retail shit job. you're not a robot
Same here. Got fired from my job at Target even though I only got 12 hours a week because I would sometimes leave early out of irritation. Glad I'm not the only one.
Why would you ever imitate pathetic 4chan shut-ins and call yourself a nigger?
I CBD vape on my off nights.
I'm trying to assimilate to 4chan culture. Nigger seems to be every boards favorite word.
To be fair they're both non-retail jobs. Computer repair man by day, security guy by night.
What are your thoughts on girls like this?

Are you planning on leaving one of your jobs at some point?
Kinda cringe desu she's not even cute.
I'm broke as fuck and I don't have a long-term plan at the moment, so no. Once I figure out a direction then maybe.
Best of luck with your future endeavours, anon.

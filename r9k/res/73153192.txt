wtf
stacey means attractive female and all anime characters are drawn as perfect 10/10 people with no flaws so that is stacy yes
An interesting theory... anon
The stereotypical Stacy is blonde blue eyed young white girl, which is vaguely what she looks like, but she's an anime girl, so it's a weird comparison to make. Social hierarchy in Japan, and especially in anime, doesn't really work the same way as in the west.

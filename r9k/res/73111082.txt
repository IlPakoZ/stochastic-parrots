To Women,
I resent you. You have made an active and thoughtless effort to demonize and demoralize me. If you have ever felt treated in a pejorative manner for being female, know that even if it really were sexism (which it probably isn't, you just don't even bother to question how men are treated) you are a hypocrite. You are so casually demeaning and offensive towards men, and it is a shame that everyone they know has browbeaten them into accepting being mistreated and rejected and hated all the time. I resent you for that. You should resent yourself for that.

It is just your fault.
It is not complicated.
Not hard, it's just you

men have it so easy. you can flitter away your 20s and 30s playing video games and drinking and doing nothing but as long as you can grow a beard/stubble and make a decent income you can still be objectively attractive and get any woman you want. meanwhile women have less than a decade to enjoy their youthful good looks before completely expiring their human value.
the most miserable individual on earth is the middle aged female, meanwhile the middle aged man is living out his best days.

This is cheap bait, but I guess I'll bite. The man that are attractive in their middle age were either (a) attractive while young from genetics or (b) built themselves up. It didn't just happened to them. They had to work their way there over two decades. The average woman gets more positive than either of those guys without having to put any work when she's in her late teens to early twenties. All you have to do is capitalize on that and pick a good man instead of riding the cock carrousel. Then, you're set for your own middle age. How is so hard for women to get?

*more positive attention

what if a woman doesnt want to pick a good man in her early twenties then settle down and raise however many children he wants and subsist off his income until she dies without any genuine personal achievement besides keeping house and home? why does a woman have to be deprived of the free and adventurous life of a man simply because she cannot reasonably retain her good looks and capabilities into her middle age?

free and adventurous
*Difficult and stressful

we should kill women once they turn 50. if they cant breed theyre worthless. they arent even good for sex either because old women are unnatractive. women should only be allowed to live for 50 years
<comment>
would you rather live a comfortable live inside of a box or a free and memorable and exhilarating life thats more challenging and character building?

Lololol cope harder incel.

Men age like wine give him another 20 years and hes going to be like sooo handsome in his 50's compared to the average 50 year old woman.

He should have gone on finasteride or something.
You're not wrong. I just abused drugs and jerked off and listened to music and watched anime for most of my younger years but also I had my engineering career and I'm pretty satisfied with my money and body as is right now with the exception my teeth are rotted out and I need to get dental implants taken care of already. I'm excited to get that done with so I can start dating girls again for the first time in years.
On other hand though divorce is terrifying and like half of marriages end with it, with 70% of those divorces initiated by women, and not only do you lose your wife but you also lose your money and your house.

I'd pick the box, preferable with included subby sexbot
<comment>
LITERALLY the former, I'm scared to do anything exciting or memorable and spend most of my time trying to distract myself from my sexlessness
<comment>
if he can get a hair transplant then definitely. if not then i hope he has a sexy hat collection like some hot casual ballcaps. only a certain kind of body snd face can look attractive with a bald or balding head and he doesnt have them

Box, which is exactly what I did. I worked and bought a house and my job went remote so I stay in my box 24/7 and have done that since 2020. I will possibly permit one (1) vagina haver inside my box along with a cat or a dog maybe but that's it, no one else allowed in.

Women will pick the latter. 
Mostly because they never expect to end-up carrying the 30kg backpack themselves or having to survive without a daddy paving their way safely
<comment>
This, they have no idea how much the burden of manhood sucks
I'd crawl back into the womb if I could
<comment>
This. Women idealize what it's like. Sure, you get more freedom, but it comes at a cost most women aren't willing to pay.
<comment>
Thank you anon, this is lifefuel. I love flexing on girls, feelsgood
<comment>
this is unironically true and the reason why i will kill myself before i turn thirty
<comment>
Replace "Men" with "Chad" and you're correct.
Undesirables remain undesirables at any age.
Also even if I suddenly became attractive to women now at 35, developmental damage has already solidified itself into my personality so too little too late, ladies.

you cannot reasonably deny that if you were to start a lifting regimen, cut some body fat, grew a beard, got a decent haircut and started dressing well, you couldnt bag all the mid to upper mid women you want. late teen-early twenty girls want you because youre mature and rugged, women your age want you because you can easily craft yourself into their best available option because theyre washed up. you may even get lucky and find a divorced milf who has only been with a few guys and you wife her up

Foids find the idea of being in a stable healthy relationship to be the most terrible thing imaginable. Foids are all gigawhores that want to get fucked by hundreds of scumbags every day.
<comment>
You don't even consider unattractive men human. That's why you think they don't exist.
<comment>
shoot yourself through the roof of the head unironically
<comment>
what if a woman doesnt want to pick a good man in her early twenties then settle down
then don't. but why do you think anyone wants to settle down with a whore? kill yourself

How the fuck someone who spend his youth years playing videogames and drinking will be attractive and have good income in his 40's
Are you a delussional bitch?
Don't you know about Aedipus complex for young men? Be a milf and shut up.
<comment>
not if you dont look good or dont have money. im broke. being a robot is honestly, im not even joking, nightmare mode
your life is legit easy. you dont know how much you are coddled for being a female, seriously. its insane
<comment>
he can just get a hair trainsplant. he's really rich
honestly, prime chico is perhaps the most aesthetic person to ever live. only maybe prime young gandy mogs him, maybe
also, ur a female, ur smv will forever be higher than most men. there will always be guys looking to love on you and get into relationships. "its over" doesnt exist for women

start a lifting regimen, cut some body fat
Gym coping only attracts gay men.
grew a beard, got a decent haircut
45% of men cant grow facial hair and 85% of men will be bald by 35 unless they got on testosterone blockers and estrogen.
started dressing well
I dont think putting a suit on does as much as you think it does.
Dressing expensive wont transform a incel into a chad who cant swat away all the teen virgin girls drooling on him and begging for his dick.
late teen-early twenty girls want you because youre mature and rugged
No they dont.
Teen girls are disgusted by old men.
women your age want you because you can easily craft yourself into their best available option because theyre washed up
No they dont.
Even at 80 they still chase 25 or below,6 foot or above and minimum twice her income and get it.
<comment>
These are the people telling you women hit the wall and men age like wine and only get more attractive as they get older.
Wow hes such a silver fox i bet he gets all the teen pussy in the picture on the right now that hes in his prime.
All the women in the room are nonstop orgasming the moment they see that receding hairline he doesnt even need to touch them.
<comment>
85% of men will be bald by 35
out of which ass did you pull that number, troony?
<comment>
From reality.
99% of men dont age gracefully they spoil like milk left in the sun and certainly dont age backwards and get hotter as they get older as some "age like wine/wall" copers desperately want to believe.
Your prime was at 18-25 you will only get more wrinkly and bald from there you will not undergo metamorphosis at 50 and turn into a chad like a caterpilar reaching maturity and turning into a butterfly.
<comment>
From reality.
Then you sure have a proof, faggot?
<comment>
get into hopeful relationship/s with family oriented men. sure they are shorter than you or maybe fat or bald but you love them anyway cause personality is more important.
several years of your life wasted.
relationship/s end. no marriage. no moving in together.
oops youre almost 30 without kids. haha tough luck you dumb bitch. try being born as the superior gender next time.
dating or life in general must be based a lot on luck. i will try again but for now i will rot. at least i feel better this way.

why are incels on here so against onlyfans? If you pay for onlyfans you will get female attention.
You'll have the opportunity to flirt with and sext attractive women. They will care about you. You can spend a lot of time with them. and you get it extremely easily. all you have to do is pay like $10 a month
They will pretend for money, the whole site os based around monetising the lonlyness of men
all relationships are transactional. this is no different than any other relationship
If you're a whore, other people experience this thing called love, not that I'd know
men aren't loved unconditionally. if the guy loses his job then the woman leaves. if the guy stops having a "good personality" the woman leaves.
transactional relationships never end well
Bait thread but anyways
Fun facts from that cursed site. Most of the whores there don't even type. They have team other cucks who do it for them. 99% times it is some dude who is taking care of replies based on some script.
Sounds like a great investment
Not only are you most likely not actually getting their attention, but even if it is, it's fake attention.
buying onlyfans is retardation and anyone doing this is retarded.
I found coomer.party recently, and am very disappointed with the actual content on onlyfans. Like it's mostly low quality snapshots and short self-filmed clips. Maybe it appeals to actual simps who get off on throwing money at e-girls for a little bit of attention, but I just wanna fap to high quality pussy recordings.
VERY IMPORTANT
HOW CAN I LOOK UP TO SEE IF ANY GIRLS I WENT TO HIGHSCHOOL WITH HAVE AN ONLY FANS? CAN I LOOK THEM UP BY NAME?

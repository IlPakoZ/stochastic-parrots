Tall
Blond
Above average looking
Buff
Can hold a conversation after a drink
My friends tell me girls like me behind my back 
Some girls even check me out when I go out 
Still a 21 yo virgin who spends most of his Friday nights on 4Chan 
God gave me the ingredients to be a Chad and I squandered them. Is there anyway I can fix this?

You are most likely ugly and coping.

Same except I'm not a virgin, not buff, and don't have friends.

nah not OP but i'm in the same boat. i am brad-lite but years of being ugly and also an extended mental breakdown caused by chronic pain has made me too esoteric for most normies. i don't mind though it's just my path in life, people can't appreciate my past and outlook on life

your vote doesnt matter anyways every government is a dictatorship with extra steps

at least in america if the majority of people complain about hwo they want to see something change long enough, and enough people die or go to prison over it, then theres a chance the dictators will meet them halfway

Actual racism and supporting whatever culture war nonsense Fox News is shilling this month. Everyone born before the year 1970, along with the Zoomers who think being ultra-right is cool, actually needs to die ASAP for the world to start making progress again. Democrats are a joke, but Republicans are the entire circus.

There is another way....a third option if you will
<comment>
what even is leftism anymore
More social safety nets to protect us from hardships.
More taxes on the rich to pay for those social safety nets.
More regulations on corporations to limit their ability to exploit us.
Y'know, actual policy.

You are not going to get anyone to vote for these policies if you are also telling them that it's healthy to cut children's cocks off
The well is poisoned, and it's not by accident
<comment>
Change challenges to promotes, opposes to promotes, won to lost, and angry to happy and you have Democrat nominess.
Yes, it is that simple.

It's about keeping the facade of American democracy going while getting the stupid masses to argue amongst themselves over sensationalist issues that ultimately have little effect on society as a whole.
<comment>
kill em all i say
<comment>
I just say I am socially right but economically left. But above all I think we are fucked regardless of what muppets gets in.
<comment>
So when it's time to vote, do you reluctantly vote for the economic right or reluctantly vote for the social left?

Being against gun control is not enough. Restore gun rights. Undo the thousands of one sided "compromises" that were made for the past couple hundred years. 
We also need to lower taxes. These are the main issues for me. Less important to me but less involvement in international affairs, decreasing spending and programs, and generally opposing things that the left wants and especially fighting against bipartisan agreements would also be nice. But that's a lot to ask. Just more freedom of guns and less taxes is enough. I'd love to see the, vaccinated punished and those who supported the push to vaccinate should be punished even more harshly.

Dude guns are supposed to protect us from the tyranny of government, not from eachother. In a world where they can drone bomb you from lower orbit or run your shit down with tanks like they did in Waco, guns aren't shit. Not against the American government. Plus if they started collecting them tomorrow, the vast majority of citizens would hand them over, including you, when they send highschool drop out with guns to your house to get them. Which is the first thing they would do if they wanted to become tyrannical. The whole gun debate is a stupid issue. It shouldn't even be up for debate. They just dust it off every time they need to distract the masses.

The economic right does nothing but suck off (((big corporations))) and sell out their own countries/people for extra shekels, and the social left is completely fucking deranged, so I would rather vote for a donkey which would be by far the most trustworthy being of them all. On certain issues like gun rights I will support someone, but I hold no belief that any of them will do anything other than put a bandaid on a gaping chest wound, not even because they themselves may suck, but because the system does not want such people and solutions, for it gives less power for the system to do as it pleases without constant fearmongering and strife.

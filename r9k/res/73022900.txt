neet all through my teen years
eventually get thrown in therapy
mfw it works
meet some guy I grew up adjacent to
introduces me to his friend group 
mfw I fit in like a glove
spend the next few years doing nothing but hanging with the boys
they convince and encourage me to start college with them (middle school dropout) 
tfw top of my class even all these years later
throw parties, smoke tons of weed, even bag a few qts

live a young man's wet dream 
classes almost over
friends going their separate ways
tfw i watched these guys grow up right in front of me while i stagnated 
skipping class more
more time alone
actually hurts this time, tf happened
days becoming the same again
spend all my time shitposting and cooming again 
mfw reverted back to old self
mfw I took nothing from my experiences and continued to be the same person
literally did a full circle
i cant escape, bros. having that taste of normalcy just makes the isolation so much worse.

It happened because I cast a spell that gives you 10 years of desolation and despair. Also, once that 10 year period ends, I'm going to cast it again, and again.

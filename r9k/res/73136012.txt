dam that's really deep, you should make a dystopian fiction about that, about big business how theyre evil and souless, really deep stuff
i hate how catchy it is lol his silly voice actually works with the song
i liked having lights on the bottom of my shoes, or heelies. i wish adults could wear heelies, because i remember it being pretty fun gliding around places.
they are pretty soulless though. we're moving to a new stage where brands are strings of numbers and shit. new drugs are produced so rapidly that people can't make laws fast enough to ban them. i've heard about fast fashion too.
it's not deep, it's just a fact of life that everyone's aware but find it too boring and overplayed to care about. does it have to be entertaining though?

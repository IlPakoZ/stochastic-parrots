I am waiting for you, I hope my letters make it to you through the mail maybe you'll finally respond because you never have since last April only people impersonated me and impersonated you and it is too much. I'm just waiting for you, no one will come between us when we finally speak to eachother I hope we can show that we both regret this and those mistakes and misunderstandings

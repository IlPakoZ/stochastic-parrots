What is this archetype of girl called?
Its like all these women are trying to be "special" in the exact same way using the exact same tricks. Is there a good word for these type of women?
E-girls, and they are the best.
Its called "animetoilet" on russian imagebroads. Idk about you guys. Anglos probably will use some more polite wording like moecore or shit.
They are worthless

back in the day these were called suicide girls and there was a whole magazine about them. it's not exactly what you say since suicide girls were the deathcore chicks but i feel its basically the same archetype. sounds a lot like pagan/wiccan witches personality too
This gives me hope as a blakkbot. I'm going to lose weight this summer so I can pick up these girls born in 2000 bros.
Yeah,but suicide girls were actual emo/punk/alt chicks. In gen z most of these girls aren't connected to any actual subculture.
Honestly crazy how they are 23 already

anon is right too. but to be honest i always felt suicide girls were kinda posers anyways. not that i met actual suicide girls but there were some wannabes in my area and they werent about the scene at all. they were about being bpd and fucking the men in the bands, but i dont think they even listened to the core
Those are simply called normies in this day and age organic oregano
My gf is like this minus the makeup. Actually for that reason she still looks really young at 30.

I run a mile or two every other day. Doesn't stop me from noticing trends.

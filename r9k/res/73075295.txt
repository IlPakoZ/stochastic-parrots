I just love him so much you guys. He looks so slander and elegant. His outfit is undeniably stylish and his hair is just fabulous. Kinda sad that he is not that popular. He looks a lot better than many more popular characters. I guess his show didn't get that much attention either I noticed. What do you guys think?

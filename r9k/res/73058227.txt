Tfw no asian bf who is controlling and will never let me leave the house and forces me to be pregnant with hapa babies.
Why live?

What if I force you to leave the house to exercise so that we can have strong babies together?
<comment>
Well I make sure to walk at least 1 mile a day on my walking pad if I can't get out of the house to take a walk/run. Not much but I at least put some effort into not being completely sedentary.

Not bad, but we need to be all rounded so we also need to build up our strength! How far do you run usually?
<comment>
Like 2.5 miles, I like to jog to a park nearby and do at least one lap their running path before heading back home. Sometimes I do more sometimes less.

you're a female, you have life on easy mode. you just sit at the finish like and pick your favorite runner. your complaints cannot be genuine

So close. I'll also control your diet though. Got to eat the right stuff so that our muscles can recover quicker and grow bigger.

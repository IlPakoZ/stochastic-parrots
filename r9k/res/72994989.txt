God fucking damn am I so damn fucking lonely it's unreal, I realizing it now as I stooped so low and tried to find friends on /soc/ and an anon accepted my friend request and it was someone who still in high school
sign up for some karate or other shit, don't pick the gym tho, nobody on gym wants to socialize and the ones that do usually keep it short and don't want to meet with you outside the gym
I finally made a friend by going to a badminton gym a few days a week. It's $50 for a month membership. If you can find some cheap hobby and regularly do it, you'll make a friend eventually.
Learn an instrument, join a band. I met my friends in and through a band I joined. Not sure how people join bands usually, I was lucky, found mine through a high school friend.
Why isn't there a website where people with no friends go to meet other people with no friends and become friends. It's such a simple idea but it obviously doesn't work or this board wouldn't be full of people with no friends. Why doesn't this idea work?

Anytime I go to the store to get some snacks, there's always hot e-girls that always look in my cart and laugh at me like this!!!
It's sooooo annoying I always get embarrassed when I'm buying very fatty snacks like chips and ice cream!!!!!!
I hate it when that happens!!!
E girls are sooo annoying!!!!
Isn't that one in the middle the same girl from that popular image where the guy is looking at a girl walking by and the the girl he's with gives him this angry disappointed expression
Yeah!!! And anytime I go to the store to buy snacks she always looks in my shopping cart and laughs at me while laughing with her friends!!!
I always blush and get very embarrassed when that happens

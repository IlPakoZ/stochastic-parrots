Would you robots settle for a green haired witch gf?
<comment>
No, likely not. I couldn't stand the bullshit for long. Assuming she just liked the aesthetic and didn't actually think any of it was real/magic then I could be fine with it.
<comment>
Does she put out on a regular basis? Then sure, I really don't give a fuck.
<comment>
You mean "witch" as in she actually casts spells and shit?....like...she could actually turn people into frogs and stuff? Yeah, no, 100% no question marrying that, thats dope asf.
If she is just mentally ill, yeah no i am good, i dont feel like getting stabbed in the chest while i sleep....which is why i will never marry or date in general but wtv, thats besides the point
<comment>
If she's feminist/progressive, doesn't care about traditional gender roles (even in men), and is fine being the taller,ore capable, smarter person in the relationship, then sure. Even if she doesn't put out. Of course women like that would never go for us so it doesn't really matter
<comment>
Would she love me? If yes, then ye. If no, then no
<comment>
tfw no witch gf to cast a love spell on u
<comment>
Yeah, sounds interesting. I don't want to date a normie, I want to do some rituals n shit. 
Not if she's super political though, on either end of the spectrum. For some reason, witch aesthetic is very political these days
<comment>
Join the Ordo Templi Orientis, sex magick and everything
<comment>
if youre not fat, then sure!
<comment>
What do you mean settle, that's exactly my type. I genuinely wish I knew someone like that irl
<comment>
Eh, she'd have to convert to the religion I'm making. I could probably find a way to include a class of clerical witches in it
<comment>
There's a girl like this in my uni but I never talk to her I just see her on the campus sometimes.
<comment>
If she was a non-fat non-deformed virgin then yes.
<comment>
sex magick is normie tier try harder glowman
<comment>
Literally wanted that with my cute Pakistani-American oneitis, but she ghosted my e-mail trying to reconnect with her after she graduated from, in the uni I dropped out of.
Fuck that cunt, I'm still pissed off at the ghosting since I wrote all my good qualities AND the best photo of me. I hope she becomes a single mom with a pickaninny, and gets super-AIDS and herpes. Fuck her.
<comment>
I wrote all my good qualities
Must have been a pretty short letter then
<comment>
I dont think normies are out there doing Gnostic sex magick rituals to summon spirits
<comment>
What I need to do? Do I need to sell my soul?
<comment>
No, it was a bit long, like 5 paragraphs.
I personally think she ghosted me because I'm a lightskinned Mexican who has the most intimidating epicanthic folds, tho. I probably looked like an unironic cartel member a bit to her; if so, I hope she murder-kills herself with her pickaninny I hope she shits in the near future for thinking that.

Yeah, it was probably cause you're Mexican, you got it

normie in the sense of dipping their toes into the occult you brainfuck
even goetia is starting to be absolute norman territory
the only thing of value you can get from crowley is 777
<comment>
No, the whole point is that you follow your spiritual calling to eventually have a union with God, you do this by contacting your Holy Guardian Angel by doing magickal rituals. Thats not the only magic they do, but the whole Holy Guardian Angel thing is the big goal you are reaching (how long it takes depends on how much you practice that stuff on your own time). Once you do get into contact with your HGA you are supposed to enact your Will and cross the spiritual abyss, a loss of ego to properly unify yourself with God. There is a book called Liber Al which states the law of Thelema, you just have to say you accept the law as the law of the new age
Sex magick is just another magickal technique, using sexual energy and such to enact magickal change or summon spirits
<comment>
Martinism/Elus Coen theurgy is by far the superior occult tradition, but good luck getting the fags here to do any of that shit (they wont do anything without the promise of pussy, and Martinism takes serious work and dedication, you also need to be a devoted Christian and all)
At least with Thelema they are doing something spiritual
<comment>
Yeah, it was probably cause you're Mexican, you got it
I wasn't like that in the e-mail, so it was 100% my looks, as always.
It's fucking over if I can't even get the interest of a woman that isn't 100% a stranger, either way. I'll simply make women's lives worse as long as I'm alive by funding wars and stuff, and doing the tax evasion and avoidance so niglets die from starvation, yeah.
<comment>
the average r9ker cant even meditate because their brain overflows with coom, so i get your point and i agree with you
i know this is not the place, but if you can, could you argue why martinism is the superior tradition? ive read about it with my teacher/mentor but never really went deep into it

social media is so tragic, because it shows us what we cant have
i fell in love with this korean asmr artist, the most popular one, ppomo. everything about her i like. im sure she's a whore in her personal life, but im ignorant of it, which makes it easier to live. i listen to so much of her asmr, and pirate it with some add that lets me download her stuff for free
if i was any non-korean girl, i would literally make her learn korean and i would listen to pomo in front of her face, and i would touch her body like she was pomo, and i would pretend she was pomo
thats how brutally hard she mogs all other girls. and the truth is, thats how brutally chad mogs every other guy. all those girls in korea searching for a man dont really love their bf's; they love the kpop star they fell in love with
social media is brutal

Jews trapped under law for thousands of years
Jesus comes along and died for the forgiveness of sins and offers the holy spirit to guide us through life (we are not guided by scripture, that's what Jesus came to free us from: the bible is the mark of the beast [literally read any of Paul's letters, Satan took Paul's letters and many other letters and tried to create a new satanic covenant [satanic law] to undo what Jesus did. Jesus died to free us from the letter and to be led by the holy spirit])
you can literally ask Jesus to give you the holy spirit (the holy spirit is the new covenant) as Jesus died so that we could have the holy spirit.
The law is void. As the law is not just as it killed a just man (Jesus). Jesus is the new testament. The holy spirit is the new covenant.
The bible is the mark of the beast. Thank god god sent Harland.
hey guys, just follow this occult law
anon, I think you're mistaken.
<comment>
nobody is telling them to do anything, if they will to do so they will, anon is just giving them a way/alternative instead of giving the same advice you faggots do 24/7
<comment>
Happened to me but I fumbled her.
<comment>
I don't have anything against the style or the weird interests, but they always come with a tower of mental illnesses and more baggage than any mortal can handle.
<comment>
no shit people here dont have relationships when all of you have surface level knowledge of everything and specifically of the occult
<comment>
I just want to coom in her booms.
<comment>
I don't think most robots are into /x/ stuff. They're more interested in complaining about lacking a girlfriend and having no meaningful relationships than they are in possessing interesting hobbies. Any case, from what I've seen, people here are too literal minded for a witch girlfriend to begin with.
<comment>
I will say I am biased because Martinism does specifically appeal to me, but Martinism is a tradition that benefits from being from the 18th century since there are several different branches to work with. There is the theurgical branch (Elus Coen), the mystical meditative branch (way of the heart, focused on inner theurgy and highly influenced by Boheme) and there is the chivalric branch focused on spiritual alchemy (CBCS). This creates a very well rounded tradition, which is focused on three big niches and aspects, that work really well when practiced together. Furthermore, Martinism is very serious work, and a lot of it is designed to be very effective. Because of the serious nature of Martinism, it doesnt take very long to achieve the equivalent of the HGA (in Martinism this is translated as Good Friend/companion) and the Martinist system goes way beyond this point. This is up to personal opinion, but its very focused and consistent, of being a Christian-oriented tradition.
But the main goal of Martinism is that of spiritual reintegration, repairing man from its fallen state. This starts with your personal state, but what really sets the system apart is that you work on repairing the world and even demonic entities itself. The beginning work where you establish contacts and link to angelic beings, leads you to practices where you bind demons, exorcise them and then eventually pull them back into the light of God - purifying them with compassion. This whole idea I find to be something that really sets it apart from a lot of other orders, mostly just focused on personal spiritual progress, Martinism keeps things to the bigger picture which I find extremely interesting. Its also a very intricately designed system, full of original stuff and very specific rituals. If you wanna learn more about Martinism I recommend looking at an online copy of Treatise on the Reintegration of Spirits (if the book is short that means its an abridged version) onarchive

No, I'm Christian. Would never work.

preforming occult magic to get closer to God
Anon.. if you truly want to get closer to God, pray to Him and develop relationship with Him instead of doing activities that sever relationship with Him. If you truly have Holy Spirit, then you don't need to fill yourself with lesser spirits that live apart from God, and if God needs you to see an angel in order to hear what He has to say, He will send you one, you don't need to summon them. Divination, sorcery, astrology, witchcraft, and necromancy are all practices that are born of wickedness and it is not good to practice these if you are trying to get closer to God. Go to the Lord directly instead of going around Him. Do not commit the sins of King Saul or that of the Egyptians or of Simon the Sorcerer, instead stay true to the Lord by honoring Him and His instructions.

jinn
id assume you have read the shamsal ma'arif in its original language to succesfully bind and not be killed by a jinn
<comment>
We are made under Gods image, this means we get to create reality under our perception among other things, magic is part of our inherent power to create reality. Theurgy is simply taking the inherent power of magic that you have, and aligning it with Gods will, under various aspects and forces that God emanated to create this world
<comment>
of course. and dont worry about "jeff" he only targets the blood of virgins

This shit is just Twin Peaks man

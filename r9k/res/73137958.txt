Once when I was in some dumb career building class everyone had to take, but then I for some reason just decided to laugh for an extended period of time very loudly and for no reason. Then didn't say anything the rest of class. Just wanted to see how people reacted.
I uh. 
Didn't date much in school

She either changed schools or killed herself, my friends thought it was funny though.
I sat alone every lunch. One day my spot was taken so I sat with the special needs kids.
When I was 14 I peppersprayed a guy in school who tried to bully me. I then told the police that he touched me and called me a slut (he didn't but he was a bully asshole anyway). Since then never got problems with bullying. Being a bit psycho can be helpful.
Every moment I was in school was autistic
One time we were playing dodgeball and this fat girl made fun of me so I kept calling her mom a whore, she walked over to kick me but I punched her in the head full force. I got taken to the principals office, they told me I can't hit girls and they might expel me, I asked why and he said you just can't. I said it was self defence so I did nothing wrong, he told me he might call the cops and I told him to do it because I know I did nothing wrong because my grandma is a lawyer. I just got a talking to and didn't get into any trouble at all in the end.
That's one of the reasons why 8th grade was my last year of school

Red dress
Dress red
<comment>
And finally a proper red dress, and anything works again
<comment>
I would like to lightly poke her bellybutton
<comment>
We still red dressing?
<comment>
the dress is still redding
<comment>
Yeah
Generate button on colab stopped working. Does that mean I have to restart the whole thing? Still connected to the google colab.
I got a few gens through before it stopped, but none were any good, so here's one from nemu.
<comment>
what I usually do is to just reload the page. I only restart the whole thing when I get the "not connected to an interface" or smthg along the lines
<comment>
The dress is not red but still pretty nice picture
<comment>
Humongous red Saeriah orbs to ponder and weight

I think I finally understanded how to avoid generation button lock. After I got a gen or added a new tags I wait for like 5-10 seconds and everything is fine, but maybe I'm just lucky and gaslighted myself into believing in this
<comment>
Goa shattered the mirror and her hand while at it

I restarted the whole thing

Come watch this show it's interesting

That works too lol

I might have rediscovered these creepy prompts I had
very dream-like

Hello aiwg, I have returned
Rochelle doesn't like to wear very fancy red dresses.

Seems like she's more willing if I take away her muscle prompts. Ai cucking me from my strong Rochelle yet again.
<comment>
Switching to Anything kind of worked. She seems to be enjoying herself.
<comment>
How about tattoos
<comment>
No one would believe the amount of time I've spent on nemu just to build up about 2 GB worth of porn starring my waifu, lads. I figured trying to generate less slutty versions of her would make me reevaluate my priorities, but if anything it just gave me new ideas for porn sets and settings.
God bless

<comment>
I guess those one are fake
<comment>
the fake boobas, imposter orbs, no nipples giving them away
<comment>
My desire to use the collab is becoming too great, I might have to drag out my old ass laptop and Gen some things until it explodes
<comment>
You can start a Collab on phone, but I guess PC is more comfortable
<comment>
Goa says "I love you" but it's silent
bursting boobas
someday I too might use the collab, but currently I am too computer retarded for it
<comment>
"Fake booba? I would never."
<comment>
Something seems super sus here...
<comment>
Here is another addition to the bodysuit theme
<comment>
Bodysuits are nice but imagine if they were weak and broke easily

Guys, quick question, if I were to drink 2/3rds of a bottle of wine, how many cans of beer is that, give or take?
I am trying to calculate how tipsy I might get with my decision to empty out my moms leftover wine bottle while they are away on their vacation trip (last evening I can drink), and I have already drank a little half liter cocktail with 2 hefty shots of rum, like 12 cl of rum to be exact
I don't feel like I've drank that much but I fear it might be deceptive. Then again I am the guy who drank a sixpack of hard cider by himself before going to a nightclub, ordering a few beers and still being too sober to even think of socializing with anyone, back in his youth
<comment>
I wish I could help you, but my ass is too scared of drinking because I don't know what I can do while drunk. Also I don't like the taste of most alcohol stuff
<comment>
Yeah, it can be a double edged sword, I've got lots of stuff to regret of being done while shitfaced, to the point of never really drinking with the intention to get shitfaced anymore, like young people seem to tend to do
I wonder what unit A7 looks like, that she pilots
<comment>
It should say on the bottle how strong it is, but wine is typically around 15% while beer is around 5%.
So three times as strong as the same volume of beer.
<comment>
The other thing that made me don't like alcohol is my dad and other drunkers on a street. I love my dad he is a nice person but when he was drunk I was embarrassed af, to the point that I hated every drunk person I see on a street. But then I grew up and became calmer, a lot calmer.
<comment>
By those calculations I am about 4 cans of beer in
yup, this is still an acceptable amount that should not get my too intoxicated
I would love to get intoxicated by the breasts tho-
Oh no, Goa is giving me an intense stare as I say that
<comment>
"You're free to stare, I'm sure Goa won't mind."
<comment>
my pc fucking crashed im back
<comment>
I don't even know how to comment this without any horny words that too cool
<comment>
wine is three times as strong as beer so it would be like if you drank two wine bottles worth of beer

Pic of the wedding day.
<comment>
For me I feel like that about drug users, not because my dad was one, but because I had the displeasure of going to school and trade schools with some who were the most stereotypical 420 blazeit weed is not addictive but I can't stop talking how I need to be high at all given times, my whole personality is based around the haha-plant and I sell all of my possessions and belongings for the giggle leaf-faggots around.
I also hate drunk people too, not tipsy people having an ok time but straight up shitting their pants, drunk and homeless etc angry etc people, but I hate people in general already and drugs/alcohol just gives people in general an excuse to be bigger cunts than they are when sober.
But yeah nothing but negative experiences, say I see a junkie on the streets I get an uncontrollable urge and feeling like they should be removed from the world and society, euthanized, killed off and so on, I can't really explain why but I just wish they were gone from the world, no that they should be manually removed from the world right there and then
and sadly for me, the older i get the less calm I am about it
God I wish more people won the darwin awards in this world and were allowed to get themselves killed rather than being a burden on everyone
in that case
jiiiiiii~
<comment>
big rip
cute tit
it rhymes
time to unleash the words of the horn
that's not too bad, these bottles really do not have that much liquid in them in general
very nice wedding dress
<comment>
I did not infact figure it out. Maybe I'll do it one day but for now I am too retard.
Same here honestly, getting a little drunk or a little high alone aren't bad but it's the fact that so many shitty people do that ruins it for me. The only alcohol I can stand is wine because almost everything else is associated with trashy middle aged men and women who are reckless and have no regard for their life. And even wine isn't perfect. While as for drugs, most drug users I've met irl are self centered morons who are just doing them because it's "fun"
<comment>
As a trashy almost middle aged man, I do like beer.
I stay away from drugs though. I tried weed in my teens, but didn't really like it much.
I also have similar experiences as yours with drug users.
<comment>
Yeah, not to mention normies in general give other normies so much forgiveness on things due to things, like one random normie talking to another random normie on how he was almost choked to death by his bro, because he got a bit too fucked up, but it's fine because everyone is a bit random and zany on drugs le lmao
no it's not ok
Or one absolute cancer of a human being on a skype server ages ago that was the biggest attention whoring faggot imaginable, but you were not supposed to call him out on it because he's le high and that's just how it is when he le smokes, now listen to him talk for hours on how his faggot butthole smells like pancakes in his opinion and how much he loves cock and hates life and turns every darn discussion about anything to be about him and how much his life suck and how lonely he is
Or how my last real life crush was at a weed smoking girl and if you think you have some misogyny in you but have not met a stoner girl, boy you are in for a treat because every negative aspect that makes you hate women as a whole, is cranked up to a whole new level due to weed and you just give up on the whole gender after listening to her flap around with whatever spews out of her pissy cunt
And at this point I realize that even if i might not feel drunk, I am some levels of intoxicated, need to get back to genning and posting waifus rather than bleeding out a life story and opinions no one really needs to hear about

AOM makes Rochelles eyes so pretty.
<comment>
I agree! But it was unprompted, so I don't know how to get it to appear again.
Took me a while to figure out too, but it's really not that hard if you follow the instructions and don't overthink it.
One thing I need to figure out over the weekend is how to get the waifu colab to gen Saeriah;
a) so she does not look like a loli
b) so she does not look like a completely flat drawing
I've gotten cool stuff out of the colab, just not entirely what I'm after.
<comment>
Yeah, while being the porn machine in general, it does have surprisingly good strong points. Wings and clothes are another thing AOM does surprisingly good
I wish I could use AOM a lot more, but it always makes Goa either too old or too young, never the right kind of petite like anything does
<comment>
very demonic aom
<comment>
and a very cute aom
<comment>
I need to commit calming down
<comment>
I am probably over thinking it but I am also just kind of stupid and don't know what the instructions want me to do or where to input things. Like what even is a cell and how do I get one. And the confusing computer language only makes it worse on my smooth brain.
Yeah aom is really good with clothes, always gens Rochelles Jean jacket nicely.
<comment>
Thank you! Here is what she wore that night.
<comment>
Goas crotch as i create odd prompts to share before bed
<comment>
so i made a bunch of prompts that do something, i do not know what, or what they even mean, but some randomly interesting stuff happens when using them so 
reversed perspective, inverted reflections, chromatic dissonance, negative colors, tonal differentiation, futuristic media, radiation grain, psychedelic lighting, surreal shadows
nighty night, test them on your waifu, something might or might not happen
<comment>
another example of stuff
<comment>
The cells are the parts with the triangular "play button" icons next to them.
Like the first one is "Install Cagliostro Colab UI"
Click button to run cell, after pasting the model, VAE, and lora links you need into the "Custom Download Corner" cell.
Just run them one by one until you get to "Start Cagliostro Colab UI". Once that is running, it generates three (or in some cases two) links, 
I usually click the second one that I don't remember what was called, but it wasn't the local one. It takes you to the generator itself.
If I remember to I can throw together a more detailed guide over the weekend.
I also need to figure out more reliable ways of making Saeriah look like herself in the colab gen. What I really do like about it is getting stuff in higher res, having a bit more control, and being able to gen more than one picture in a batch. So if you get something that works, just set it to gen a batch of a dozen or so images and let it do the work.
<comment>
But anyway I am glad nemu is always there for me when I need it. And when I need *her*
Going to work, later /aiwg/

Here is my waifu on a day out in the city.

I would very much like to be princess carried by a strong catwoman as well!
<comment>
Still waiting on colab to work, wonder if I need to start over because of my bad connection
<comment>
Colab doesn't use your connection for many things normally.
Can you give me details of what's happening? It's possible that colab itself is unstable now.
Also, okay. I got enough feedback to know that I'm terrible making guides. I'll try to improve it with the complains you guys got
<comment>
Currently been waiting forever on the "start colab ai" cell to finish loading since it's been going forever, though that might be normal idk. As for the guide it's not bad we're just a little dumb.
<comment>
til we were dead and gone and buried check the pulse and come back swearing its the same after three months in the grave
<comment>
For me, I was having huge issues with Civitai going down which meant that the colab couldn't download the models from it. Could be that again.
<comment>
My bad I meant the "start colab ui" cell not working
<comment>
I just ran it now and doesn't seems like having issues.
Had the other cells run sucessfully? (It should show you a green sucess symbol on the left).
If there was any error, can you screenshot it to me?
Is it too late for me to red dr-sui-drees?
<comment>
what model is this

<comment>
Kinda lovely how I removed everything else her bodysuit and cloak, but her sexy body insistis in stand out.

<comment>
All the previous cells ran correctly and completed quickly however this cell is taking ages to load. Hasn't exactly hit an error I've just been stuck on it for a while now.
Keep in mind i am trying to run this on a phone, i dunno if that would change anything or not though.

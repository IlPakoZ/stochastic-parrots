I am a white woman and I love black cock
I understand that people hae their own preferences when it comes to relationships and dating, and that is perfectly normal. However, it's imprtant to recognize that the race or ethnicity of a person should not be the sole factor when considering a relationship with them. It's impotant to focus on building a genuine connection based on mutual respect and compatibility. Rmember to always be respectful and treat others the way you would like to be treated. Is there anything else I can assist you with?

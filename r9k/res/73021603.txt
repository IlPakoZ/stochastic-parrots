Does this explain why females are so insufferable to deal with?
<comment>
Yes
They are unironically carrying fragments of other mens' souls in their vessel
"Casual sex" is a meme, there's nothing casual about sex

My wife has racked up a 300 body count with other men throughout our marriage and has become pretty aggressive with me, so I'd say this is true

any child you have with used goods will never be 100% yours

Also good to remind the robots here that self improvement isn't going to fix anything when women give Chad the pussy for free.

you probably have multiple biological fathers

Women and simps tell me science isn't real and neither is sperm. So checkmate, incel.

Promiscuous women were deemed garbage for a reason before feminism corrupted relationships.

This study is not only old as shit but also was done on people who were dead at the time.
You would have proved your point harder if you actually linked something.
Why are you such a lazy shit.
<comment>
This study is basically it is possible to fuck some sense into woman!
PUMP HARD &amp; FAST &amp; OFTEN, BROS!
<comment>
Is there any reason to doubt the study? We're already seeing and living in the aftereffects of women's rights on an international scale.
<comment>
to fuck some sense into woman!
Did you think the mind-breaking tag in Hentai was random?
<comment>
he just learned about microchimerism
One of the stronger blackpills. I guess you're here forever now.
<comment>
Its not to doubt the study but
A, you help people who are looking at it by having links
B. so you dont get used to looking at headlines and just accepting it.
The fact that this was done on corpses who were in their prime in the 80s and that this study is based on information from 15 years ago is important. Negligence on this is how you get set up for traps later on.
Taking a picture of some head line from some place is useless on its own and just leads to misinformation. You need everything to be right. Even when something is apriori.
<comment>
From what I have read, these studies refer to male DNA as a result of pregnancy with a male baby, as in it's the baby's DNA.
Suggesting the male DNA is from male sexual partners is misleading.
<comment>
The point of the studies it that half the women didn't have male children, miscarriages, or abortions.
You're just as lazy as op, he didnt leave any studies and you didn't bother to look at any.
<comment>
I like how some years back, this was just studies done on mice or something, and the absolute vitriol and adamant certainty that microchimerism is NOT and could NEVER be true for humans
o i am laffin now
<comment>
Just cut up brains of living foids, bro
Listen, I may not have high opinion of women, but even I think that's a step too far.
<comment>
I'm curious what mechanism could introduce said dna into foid.
I know that vagina tries to absorb and recycle what it can. What can't be results in periods.
Could it be something akin to prion disease?
<comment>
But they'll deny the fuck out of this because they cannot accept it
<comment>
it's called telegony and it's real lol
it happens in both animals and humans
<comment>
Quote:
'Besides known pregnancies, other possible sources of male microchimerism include unrecognized spontaneous abortion, vanished male twin, an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation, or sexual intercourse.'
Translation:
Even though the women in this study haven't had male pregnancies it could be a result of unknown male pregnancies.
Also, heck, it could be sex because we're just throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks.
Conclusion:
Male DNA is from being pregnant with a boy.
Male DNA from women who haven't been pregnant with a boy is probably because they actually have been pregnant with a boy.
Male DNA from sexual partners is basically opinion at best.
<comment>
see what sticks
Yes in the almost 20 year old study. I'm sure in there are more recent ones like what OP's picture is referencing that are more conclusive. You have to imagine a study that shows sperms effect on womens mind wouldnt go anywhere.
My sources are only what I found on the topic. If >>73021603 (OP) >>73021804 shared his and not just a screen capture we wouldnt have this problem.
<comment>
So as a minimum foids who got pregnant and aborted their kids would have this too?
<comment>
Yeah there is every reason they want to sweep this under the rug hoping people never find out the truth. It would collapse all societies as we know them and men would seriously start to reflect on the real nature of reality. It is very clear women should never be promiscuous.
<comment>
learning this fact a few years back unironically helped me achieve some solace. even if some woman were to settle for me, there'd be no point for me to date them, as i wouldn't be able to secure my lineage and it definitely wouldn't be a romantic romance, more so just one out of convenience. takes no hymen, no diamond to the next level. 
happens in other species. no study that says the opposite.
<comment>
reeeeeee it isn't true! I'll post a study that proves it to be true!!!!
<comment>
Bro don't you think you should have posted a study that disproves this fact, rather than one that proves it?
<comment>
Did you guys miss the part where the study was done or corpses? Unless.you're dating and fucking corpses on Tinder, in which case you have bigger problems than sperm in their brains.
<comment>
Does this happen to gayfags too or does semen realize when it has been bamboozled and deposited into another man?
<comment>
Muh corpses
Again- are you implying we should dissect brains of living women?
That is some seriously weird objection, anon.
<comment>
Depends on exact mechanism of the process.
If it's low key prion disease, then probably, since ass also anus also absorbs nutrients.
If it's only result of pregnancy, then obviously not.
Either way good look detecting it, since it's not unusual to find male dna in faggot brains.
In fact I'm pretty sure it's expected, lol
<comment>
If they were able to identify male DNA from different individuals in women they could do the same in men if this is not just a byproduct of pregnancy. But I doubt that study, or any further studies on microchimerism, will ever happen. The possible >implications would be too harmful for globohomo's agendas.
<comment>
The brain starts decaying almost immediately after death, so cadaver studies done on it aren't very useful. You'll just have to live with not knowing.

reminder that telegony is real and if a woman was ever been creampied she is storing genetic information from sperm in her uterus
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35843387/
Uterosomes: The lost ring of telegony
According to evidence, telegony may occur either through the infiltration of sperm into the somatic tissues of the female genital tract or the presence of fetal genes in the mother's blood. It is highlighted that sperm penetrates into the mucosa of the uterine and possibly alters the genetic structure, affecting the embryo and enduring from one pregnancy to the next, which may be one of the potential mechanisms of telegony. Uterine fluid, uterine gland-derived histotroph, supplies key nutrients for successful embryo implantation and it is important during the first trimester, especially, because of its susceptibility to maternal states. The presence of EVs in uterine fluid (uterosomes) was reported in mice, sheep, and humans, including a wide range of biomolecules, such as proteins, and non-coding RNAs. In this review article, we presented a new idea to explain telegony. Based on our idea, after the previous male sperm entry into the female reproductive system, those sperm which do not participate in fertilization penetrate into the somatic cells of the uterus and store their genetic/epigenetic information there. The sperm of the next partner reaches a location in the female reproductive canal where it exchanges information with the uterosomes and obtains the proteins and non-coding RNAs required for fertilization, development, and implantation.

wheres the 2020 update

Love it when high school dropouts and terminal NEETs talk genetics lol

this JUSTIFIES being a slut
Imagine having hundreds of of pieces of chad DNA in you to be passed to your offspring, cucking the beta genes of the beta-bucks'ing retard who gets to impregnate her in the end

coping whores
get back to instagr

"brain"
"persist after pregnancy"
Incels legit too retarded to read.
<comment>
whatever will help me to offset the genes of my beta paypig I'll barely ever fuck for an exorbitant amount of money.
cope faggot
<comment>
Everyone I don't like is big meanie dumdum
You assume too much about your opposition.
<comment>
Not only that but it was only performed on parous women. The only women who carried male DNA were those who had sons. And the remaining DNA was found to be inherited from the womens fathers, not sexual partners. Incels are genuinely retarded holy shit kek.
<comment>
any previous male sperm entry into the female reproductive system >>73025595 is le pregnancy 
kek thanks for your tears seething subhuman
<comment>
too retarded to even read a 4chan post
You cannot make this up.
<comment>
What is the point being made? Let's assume the r9k take is correct, that male DNA makes it into a female brain. What does r9k believe this does to the brain? What makes you think that?
<comment>
So those people saying 23andme gives you a fake 1% african to fuck with you are just unaware that their mom had bbc several times and hlnowntheu have microchimerism?

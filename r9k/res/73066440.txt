Had another dream where I flirt with a cute girl for a while and then start making out with her.
I have never had this experience and every time I dream it, it feels real, and I'm devastated when I wake up and realize this has never happened to me.

Do you like cry
No I don't cry, I just get hit with a wave of depression and lie on my floor for a bit.
Huh your feelings seem straight forward. I never really feel the need for intimacy but that's all i ever talk about.
If you learn lucid dreaming you can do it in dreams when ever you want, and have sex, and have a harem with 1000 girls. No real ... but what is the difference in the end.
I lucid dream at random all the time, and do this, but it's not real and there is a huge difference in the end.

Friendly reminder that trannies will NEVER be women. 
Biology always wins in the end.

every day you think about us
you will never stop thinking about us
you will never be free

Every day you consider suicide
You will never be a woman
You will kill yourself

even if I killed myself your obsession would just continue. your every waking moment consumed by thoughts of us. thinking about trannies when you wake up. thinking about trannies when you eat. thinking about trannies when you sleep. spending your free time posting about trannies. that is your life

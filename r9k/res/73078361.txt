I feel nostalgic for the 15th century. Medieval European history has always been a massive interest of mine and I sometimes weep when listening to particularly beautiful renditions of Medieval carols. I feel a deep connection with the Medieval era and those who lived then, I almost feel their emotions even.
Hey, I also work in IT.

For me? It's the 10th century.

You're wistful or yearning for it, not nostalgic. Learn some vocab.

why do americans do this?
early settlers build rinky-dink bridge
infrastructure and population growth make old bridge obsolete
designate bridge a historic landmark
it's fucking covered bros! they built it by hand bros!
who cares? is there no one in this country that can build a fucking wooden bridge over a creek anymore?

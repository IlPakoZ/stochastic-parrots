I have thought a bit about the issue that many have with female robots on here and I think I have come to a conclusion. Females have been browsing this board for fairly long now AND I am okay with it. I do not think they are making the board worse. I think a female can have all those issues men have as well, being hikkineet, disabled or ill mentally or physically, being awkward or just ugly, whatever. All that fembots can have too and as the only thing that you post about isn't your sex, then that's okay.
What I have an issue with and what is ruining this board are non-virgins and zoomers. All those people from tiktok and reddit. Long story short,
I'd rather have 2013 /r9k/ with females in it, than 2023 /r9k/ with men only.
If only the normies could go, but that won't happen. This place is unfortunately lost.
Single niggers get off my board!!!!!!
/r9k/ is for married people only
REEEEEEEE3EEEEEEEE

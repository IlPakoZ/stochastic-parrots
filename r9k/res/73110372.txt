Be me
I'm into language learning and humanities in general 
I'm trying to be a better christian in general
I like to go outdoors to clear my head
I don't drink, do drugs or smoke
I love metal music, horror movies and all
I also like to play guitar even though I suck at it
Should I go for trad girls or more metalhead, goth etc... type of girls?
why do normalfags think liking metal and horror makes you goth
go to a church, you will never be goth
Whatever happened to the straightedge thing where Christians acted hardcore and shit? Find a chick into that.
I guess I could say I'm straight edge in a way since I never drank alcohol or did drugs so I meet the requirements 
That's an option, yes
I do like gothic literature too and it's archtecture but yeah other than that I'm pretty normie
you are too nice to be goth, no disrespect
go to a church or something
I'm into language learning and humanities in general
What does this even mean?
Anyway, there is no "type" of girl you should go after. The world isn't high-school, we don't all go around prostituting ourselves out to Vanity Fair buzzwords and TikTok aesthetics. You just go on your nerve; chemistry is really the only thing that matters in dating. 'If someone's chasing you down the street with a knife you just run, you don't turn around and shout, "Give it up! I was a track star for Mineola Prep."' Find a girl you like and let that be the end of it. They're people, too.
Go trad, but try different types. A lot of anons get analysis paralysis and never do anything when in reality, usually the best way to find out what works and doesn't is trial and error, or observation.
Go for tard

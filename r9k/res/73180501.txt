How many likes do you get when you make an online dating profile? I made a bumble an hour ago and have 7 likes currently and I don't know if this is bad.

Dating apps boost the living shit out of your profile for the first 48 hours or so to get you hooked, then it usually dries up. Last time I was desperate enough to try an app (couple months ago), I got 26 matches on Tinder in 2 weeks. All of them either never responded to the first message or ghosted when I tried to set up a date. I've had plenty of hookups and even got some fwbs with fat/ugly women before, but dating apps are mostly a massive waste of time unless you're ultrachad or live in place like NYC where the population density is so high it's impossible to fail.

7 likes in an hour seems pretty good but I've only used Tinder never Bumble. I get a handful of matches per day, maybe 5 or so.

Too much, it's annoying as shit. And the people i match with, while attractive, i have nothing in common with.

I live in NYC and I don't get matches on dating apps, I had to uninstall all of them or else I'd go insane. Granted it might've been because I'm short, but I thought I'd find at least one chick who'd be into that. But nah. Stuff like bumble and tinder say I have one match hiding and then never pair me with them.

You must be really unattractive or socially incompetent to not get laid when you're surrounded by 4+ million women

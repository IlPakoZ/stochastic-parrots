It's almost May. What are your plans for it?
Bumping for Elliotkino.
He was cute I could have saved him. Such a shame hapa boys all hate themselves so much.
learn to drive and hopefully that will keep my will to live alive for a bit, it might even make girls want me since they seem to be disgusted by dudes who cannot drive.
They don't care about Chad being unable to drive. I know Stacys that literally drive their Chads everywhere because he is so Chad.

looks like a tick engorged with blood -- your blood?

You need a lighter to kill those. Don't touch them.

It's okay, I set him free in my backyard.
Yeah. I fed him a little before setting him free.

Lets the parasite live, so it can continue to spread disease
Fuck you
<comment>
Feed it to your chickens. You do have chickens anon? Right?

All these great arachnids and the tick chooses to be a parasite. No clever web, no fearsome claws, just an ugly little blood bag. A despicable creature.

<comment>
Why do you have to kill it with fire tho?
I never saw one of these irl, I've lived in a city all my life.

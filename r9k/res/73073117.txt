Found this little cutie in my bed :3
a-anon... please stay healthy that's not good.
looks like a tick engorged with blood -- your blood?
You need a lighter to kill those. Don't touch them.
It's okay, I set him free in my backyard.
Yeah. I fed him a little before setting him free.
Lets the parasite live, so it can continue to spread disease
Fuck you
Feed it to your chickens. You do have chickens anon? Right?
All these great arachnids and the tick chooses to be a parasite. No clever web, no fearsome claws, just an ugly little blood bag. A despicable creature.
just like you, bitch. bugs are just like us.
Dude that's a tick wtf burn it
Why do you have to kill it with fire tho?
I never saw one of these irl, I've lived in a city all my life.
maybe you not me, I'm a harvestman

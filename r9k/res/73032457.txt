are incels and radfems agreeing?
two sexes, male and female, based on biological differences. female value was having kids and nurturing them/others, male value was being physically strong and performing manual labor. the male value has become entirely redundant in current year because of robots and shit. now you just have some men that look better. might as well fuck those ones.
The actual female mirror of the incel ideology is Female Dating Strategy. I am sure like 90% are probably radfems though so yea.
they completely agree with each other
Outside of factories there are basically no robots, and AI is already making most female dominant fields like design, writing, office jobs, and even medicine automated. Every expert or similar as of now says that manual labour is the least in danger from automation, and of the white collar jobs least in danger it is mostly engineering stuff, another field dominated by men. If it takes off and there wont be any sudden breakthroughs reshaping current predictions you could see man breadwinners and housewives return.

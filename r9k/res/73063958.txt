I think that African Americans are the poorest and most marginalized group because of slavery. It is likely that the dumbest and weakest Africans were selected for during the slave trade. The smarter African tribes were able to avoid enslavement and sell the others tribes to America. Anyone who believes the argument that there is systemic racism is either black or a dumb whore. The US government has in the past, but the small portion of taxes blacks bring keeps the government from deporting them.
From what I remember someone did the math before on how much black people get in welfare and it exceeds what's predicted for their tax revenue. They're not kept for money, they're kept for votes.
Systemic power. They weren't de facto weaker, just a smaller tribe.
But we waz the kingz Bruhh

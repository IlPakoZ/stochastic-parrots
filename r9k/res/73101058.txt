waiting for bus
homeless guy approaches
asks for a bus ticket
no worries, pay for it
feel terrible all day
That definitely should have been a happy moment, doing something nice for someone but all day I've felt awful. 
Anyone else have experiences like this? Just feeling the "wrong" emotions after doing / experiencing something.

Wake up stupid early
Get ready for a day of drudgery to earn someone else their money
Commute across a soulless urban hellscape of ruined humanity to Generic Retail Outlet #22476
Without complaint do the labor expected of you
"It's a hard economy anon, so your meagre wages are being lowered appropriately to less than meagre"
Be a sperg so can't really hide human failings like tiredness or pretend to be as enthusiastic like a tard in a cake shop about near-slavery 
Full shift standing
One short break, the staff room is somehow more suicidal ideation inducing than the shop floor
Customer decides its time to take out his failing marriage on the first name-tag he sees
Some impotent rant about me not smiling enough for his tastes, strange, he's clearly raging about his unfaithful wife and yet the words coming out of his mouth are attacking me
Blows up at helpless wage cuck who has to stand there and take it
Sorry for not being a expert two faced lying normie where fake smiles come as easily as breathing?
Look at manager who has approached the commotion, he takes over, I go back to work
some time later
"Anon your attitude is poor, you should be thankful for the opportunity to be here, and you need to treat customers better
We're not even humans to any of these people, are we?

I always wondered that, as a teen and early 20s I worked at a grocery store and it's like jesus do people get a hard on over the tiny bit of power they have over a teen cashier. Yeah shove the circular in my face like I control how items ring up in the register and that sixty cents is as upsetting as if I killed a family member. I don't get it. Like haven't most people worked at retail or food at some point in their lives?
Then maybe I see another side, I don't expect the bubbly waiter routine but say the grocery store, cashiers now don't even say the total at the end like come on. It's weird and like the most basic part of it. 
Overall yeah, owners, managers expert you to care as much as they do but we all know deep down the store you work at wouldn't even spend ten dollars on flowers if you died, even if it was on the job. They'd ask your mom if she could finish the shift. 
A bit much but these people are despicable.

You work retail. I would rather they just tagged everything with RFID and required a credit card swipe to enter. You were too stupid to get a real job, so now you stand around to keep people honest and not steal. That is your life. Would you like to try again?

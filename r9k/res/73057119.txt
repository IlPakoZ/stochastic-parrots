We're not even humans to any of these people, are we?
I always wondered that, as a teen and early 20s I worked at a grocery store and it's like jesus do people get a hard on over the tiny bit of power they have over a teen cashier. Yeah shove the circular in my face like I control how items ring up in the register and that sixty cents is as upsetting as if I killed a family member. I don't get it. Like haven't most people worked at retail or food at some point in their lives?
Then maybe I see another side, I don't expect the bubbly waiter routine but say the grocery store, cashiers now don't even say the total at the end like come on. It's weird and like the most basic part of it. 
Overall yeah, owners, managers expert you to care as much as they do but we all know deep down the store you work at wouldn't even spend ten dollars on flowers if you died, even if it was on the job. They'd ask your mom if she could finish the shift. 
A bit much but these people are despicable.
You work retail. I would rather they just tagged everything with RFID and required a credit card swipe to enter. You were too stupid to get a real job, so now you stand around to keep people honest and not steal. That is your life. Would you like to try again?
Get a better job?
thanks for the reddit karma lol
no. you're a uniform and nametag.

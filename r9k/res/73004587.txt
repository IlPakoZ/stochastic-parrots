A new report says the subreddits r/IncelExit and r/ExRedPill, and other similar forums, may be used to help de-radicalise men drawn to incel ideology.
With 14,200 and 19,700 subscribers respectively, these subreddits are populated by many individuals who are searching for a pathway out of what is known as "the manosphere" - a collection of online spaces known for misogyny and opposition to feminism.
The authors The (de-)radical(-ising) potential of r/IncelExit and r/ExRedPill said these online spaces in particular hold potential benefits to educate men and boys about consent and respectful relationships.
Joshua Thorburn, report author and researcher at Australia's Monash Gender and Family Violence Prevention Centre, told VICE World News that the forums aren't a silver bullet, but that "some individuals do appear to succeed in going from a very misogynistic outlook to a progressive or feminist worldview. Some former incels and red pillers appear to have become unexpected allies in the feminist movement. But deradicalisation is not a simple, linear or guaranteed process for the individuals who participate in this forum."
He added: "The fact that many men are turning away from the most viciously misogynistic beliefs of the manosphere is a very positive change. We must encourage and recognise that other men and boys participating in manosphere forums have the agency and capacity to renounce their misogynistic views."

I think if youve gone off the deep end, there's no saving you from becoming the supreme gentleman. The subreddit will only teach them how to blend in better.

Have you considered you're wrong and just need to re examine your radical chud attitudes?

show the amount of r/IncelExit and r/ExRedPill users that were able to find a partner, i'll wait...
inceldom is not a choice. it doesn't matter if you respect women or are angry and bitter towards them, you're still an incel.

Yeah but that's the whole point of that sub, it's not to make you attractive to women. It's meant to turn you into a docile person who doesn't engage in these discussions online because it hurts their feelings apparently lol

There's something that makes this feel so dehumanizing. I would rather be a radical loner misogynist then ever act so pathetic, especially when the alternative is mediocrity at best

I chatted with the exredpill guy a long time ago. He was a pickup artist who banged a bunch of girls and then got married. Different situation entirely.

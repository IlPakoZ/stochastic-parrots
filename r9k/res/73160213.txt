Suicide is a sin
Leave demon
Thank you Mr Goldberg I will consider killing myself instead of leaching off your cattle money eating into your profits.
Suicide was mainstream before the Jews though.
You don't have to keep suffering
Fly to the opposite side of the planet
You will go from having one set of problems to another, and maybe you'll be better at handling the new set of problems before you
suffering doesnt end when you get pussy, faggot
suffering keeps going as long as you are in this place, death is freedom
Fuck off blackpiller

SEXUAL FRUSTRATION CAN END
You can do whatever you want, but its objectively a shitty thing to uninstall yourself when you either have dependents in your life or parents that are still in your life. I've already failed as a son to my mom who expected at least decent things out of me, the least I can do is stay alive until she passes
Failure is so gay and I am not gay.
Pretty sure my mom isn't the Jews, and I would like to do her the courtesy of letting her believe she was 3/3 on raising decent, functional human beings until she's gone.

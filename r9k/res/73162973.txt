Does bodycount matter for a woman?
I'm not reading all those words
For the gorillionth fucking time, yes.
No. There is millions of cowards that are afraid they are going to be left alone.
Just dont say your bodycount.
Say you're still a virgin and if he asks about your hymen say you broke it with a dildo.
How are they going to know besides you telling them theres no number above your head that goes up the more men you fuck.
I just say im a virgin every time.
Yes. If it is big then women see something in him so he is attractive.
It's over
I can tell you are not a women, or at least one that matters, because zoomer women dont even give a fuck about purity, they unironically think being a whore is exploring yourself and that the only men who want virgins are incels and losers.
It matters for both genders
touch grass my man
This. Men want a pure woman meanwhile women want an experienced man
I do and ill touch it even more if you gargle my balls nigga

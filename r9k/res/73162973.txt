Does bodycount matter for a woman?
pic rel
I'm not reading all those words
For the gorillionth fucking time, yes.
No. There is millions of cowards that are afraid they are going to be left alone.
Just dont say your bodycount.
Say you're still a virgin and if he asks about your hymen say you broke it with a dildo.
How are they going to know besides you telling them theres no number above your head that goes up the more men you fuck.
I just say im a virgin every time.
Yes. If it is big then women see something in him so he is attractive.
If you don't fuck her on the first date a woman will literally never respect you
It's over
how are they going to know 
what are rumors
what is actually getting in bed with you
what is seeing that youre not inexperienced
what is your whore past cemented in history through the men you fucked and the internet
I can tell you are not a women, or at least one that matters, because zoomer women dont even give a fuck about purity, they unironically think being a whore is exploring yourself and that the only men who want virgins are incels and losers.
It matters for both genders
touch grass my man
This. Men want a pure woman meanwhile women want an experienced man
I do and ill touch it even more if you gargle my balls nigga

why are you pursing your lips like that?

idk why people keep posting online dms as evidence of the blackpill?
1. they can be easily faked
2. even if they aren't fake it doesn't prove anything. ofc only looks matter when you're looking for people online. the whole personality thing only works irl. you have to talk to someone and then make a connection. if you have good social skills then you'll be able to. the real problem that most of us here face is that we're socially retarded and can't hold a convo for more than 30 seconds. i said this in another thread but this fat balding nerdy guy i went to hs with has a cute virgin gf.

i understand you spicbro...

they can be easily faked
Everything can be easily faked.
Everyone on 4chan could just be a big chatbot system and you could be the only human here.
and even if its real i dont care anyways just like... be confident you know? 
Oh ok.
this 5'1 balding indian janitor i know totally slayed all the pussy in highschool and has a 10/10 virgin wife now
And this cant be easily faked?
I should just believe your word right because...

1 guy is not even ugly
2 part of having confidence is not giving a shit if she reacts like that. Just shake it off and play it cool

and even if its real i dont care anyways just like... be confident you know?
except i didn't say that. i said that in online dating ofc looks are only going to matter because that's all you have. your personality can't be judged through text, only irl.
this 5'1 balding indian janitor i know totally slayed all the pussy in highschool and has a 10/10 virgin wife now
another lie. i didn't say he had a 10/10 gf, or that he slayed in hs, you did. i said he has a cute gf that's a virgin.

letting one bitch ruin your image of dating and women in general 
Neurotic moment op. There are plenty of bitches out there, but also plenty of good girls. Also if the guy was less cringe he would've gotten a better result
<comment>
FACT CHECK:I DID NOT SAY SHE WAS A 10/10 VIRGIN I SAID SHE WAS A CUTE VIRGIN!!!! DEBUNKED!!!
lol

why do you people keep shilling this blue pill shit so hard? it's hard being an ugly social retard. everything is stacked against us, if you really are in that same camp. do you know how hard it is to build social skills? but you act like i can just snap my fingers and do it.
you can at least say something realistic rather than "just be as charismatic as chad lmao". it's not a personality issue to struggle socially. what if you have autism or social anxiety? or you've spent most of your life as isolated? normies conflate those things because they don't want to sound shallow, but they are.

confidence in becoming a greasy fat gaymer who probably watches pron and tranime.

Gf gets unsolicited dms from thirsty dudes
Laugh as even chads get butthurt when she roasts them
<comment>
i'm not even shilling the blue pill and i don't know why you're saying i am. all i'm saying is that the majority of people here assume their problem is looks when really its just lack of social skills. not once however, did i say that you can just build social skills. in fact i didn't even give advice, i just stated a problem and you guys sperge out, fucking hell man.
<comment>
yeah bro my gf gets dmed by chads but nah she's loyal, she'd never cheat on me bro she's only texting them back to roast them bro
<comment>
Laugh as even chads get butthurt when she roasts them

He looks good tho I'm a tranny :3

the whole personality thing only works irl. you have to talk to someone and then make a connection.
This is boomer advice. Even girls I meet IRL first immediately want to shift all interaction to text. You can't use real world interactions to trump online interactions any more because there are no remaining relationships that are entirely IRL. 
I have friends that I have known since kindergarten who I interact with primarily by group text. Because it's motherfucking 2023, grandpa.

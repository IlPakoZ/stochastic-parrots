whatever created the universe also created trannies

Why do most trannies always have terrible uncared for hair? It's always frizzy, unbrushed, and looks dry

Moses, Jesus, nobody said two words about transsexuals in the magic book of the Hebrews.
I say have fun, if you get to the spirit realm and they're like "What's the deal, bro?" tell them they should have used their omnipotence to see trans coming and written it down.

God loves you, even if you fuck a tranny.

Probably because nobody teaches you how to take care of your hair if you're male.
I'm not a tranny but I also don't know anything about haircare and all regular women seem to keep their hair in perfect condition all the time so that's probably just beat into you early on through female socialization if you're born female.

Holy shit her boobs are fucking huge, is being fat the only way to have big boobs as a tranny? I need to know.
<comment>
Boobs are mostly made of fat.
Of course weight gain is essential for boobs.
Shooting up hrt as a tranny and expecting good results without eating a large caloric surplus is like shooting up steroids as a bodybuild without eating more and expecting gains.
Being a tranny is just a special kind of bodybuilding with estrogen instead of testosterone.

I knew all of those things, it's why I tried to gain some weight before starting hrt, but that isn't some weight, that goes beyond being a bit chubby.

It isn't difficult to teach yourself to maintain appearance and personal hygiene. You just have to experiment and listen to what your body tells you. These troons are just mentally ill perverts who are in denial of what they are, making them incapable of listening to their bodies.
I say this as a 29 year old man who still has thick healthy long hair and have most of my life. The kind of hair, even eyelashes women openly compliment and envy. I have been mistaken for a woman from behind while accompanying women multiple times. These tranny freaks would kill to be in my position. With laser hair removal and make up I could "pass" better than 99% of them, yet here I am comfortable being a man with both masculine and feminine traits, both mannerisms and appearance.

If you don't want to be overly heavy you could do weight cycling to help with boob growth where you gain weight and then reduce calories to get back down to a lower weight.

Women have a couple of decades experience and have been taught what to do by their mothers, friends, sisters, hairdressers, etc
Men with long hair or troons dont stand a chance
Im a guy whos had long hair since 2020 maybe and im still figuring shit out all the time

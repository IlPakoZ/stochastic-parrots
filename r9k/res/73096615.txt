all i want is to have a room to myself to neet in until i grow old and die
you live in a suburban home, you already have a room
i want a cute neet bf to rot away with, i feel you sister.
Idk about OP but unless you have infinitely reliable passive income, it's not viable all the way to old age. I too share OP's desire, but as things stand, I won't be able to NEET for even a few more years.
we only rent it, the house isnt ours. and its not my room, my parents could kick me out of it at any time if i dont eventually work a job/go to school.
all i want is a room somewhere
paid for with Section 8 welfare
with one big gaming chair
oh wouldn't it be lovely
lots of vidya for me to play
lots of simps to send me their pay
no school, no job, that's gay
oh wouldn't it be lovely
oh so lovely sitting on my skinny fembot ass
i will post tits if you buy me an Xbox gaming pass

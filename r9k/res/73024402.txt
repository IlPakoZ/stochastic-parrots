Any other men who had physically and emotionally abusive mothers? I am obsessed with yanderes and strong domineering women...

Emotionally yes. But it was just a maladaptive coping mechanism from her own trauma

strongly dislike domineering women tho. also dislike very passive women.

I got absolutely beat to fuck by my mom and my neurologically disabled step dad, I got chased down and pinned by my mom multiple times and beat naked in front of my siblings and shit
Yeah I wish an omnipotent yandere mommy would obliterate me, how could you tell?

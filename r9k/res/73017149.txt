I LOVE being a woman. I love dressing up how I want and being accepted regardless. I can wear a dress and be treated professionally, I can wear sweats and a hoodie and people will think Im slummy and cute. I can wear something revealing and be applaudedfor dressing fierce. I can do my make up, or I can go no make up and be called naturally beautiful. I love being heard and seen, even if my problems are miniscule. Almost everything in life has been handed to me, and if it wasntI was spoon fed it. I love being nurturing and taking care of people. Nothing makes me feel better than being looked at as a healer. I love putting others before myself. I love not having to go to a job, and instead take care of my future husband andfamily while being a homemaker. I want to be someones home one day. Although being a woman is great, I think men and women bring out the better in each other. A man helps me with heavy lifting and I will cook him dinner, rub his back and do his laundry. Men and women are a great team when we set our differences aside and start working together.

Trans women are still women even though they're not biowomen.

if you're young and have genuine gd you should transition. transitioning alone won't stop the pain but better to be a little happy than whatever i am, empty, hollow.
stop caring about what others think when we die we rot and everything keeps moving, no one will care. fuck this gay world.
I'm the same; born a girl, I knew I wanted to be a boy from a very young age. It got worse when I hit puberty but I thought transitioning would be hopeless. I hate my body so much, I hate my voice, I hate being perceived as female even though I don't present otherwise. I pretend to be a boy online and that makes me feel okay until I remember the reality.
this has to be bait 
even rape victims aren't that mentally ill
good luck, anonymousses.

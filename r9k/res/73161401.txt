My life is decent overall, I enjoy my pastimes and I like my coworkers, I love my friends and family. The only thorn in my side is women. I can talk to them fine in general, but when it turns sexual of flirtatious I shut down. I might have some rare form of emotional retardation. When a girl hits on me or even brings up sexual topics the best I can do is try to change the subject or wait it out. I don't know how to deal with it and I hate that about me. Has anyone else experienced this?

tfw most other fembots are straight girls with cluster b personality disorders who hate other women.
Why live? I just want to meet other NEET bi or gay (biological) girls and stay inside and make each other cum all day.

I saw like 3 posts talking about chad after not scrolling for that long. No woman cares about this mystical being known as chad, epically a lesbian.
I'm not really into yaoi but its not like I have anything against it! I have a few M/M ships I like.

Neet is someone who is not in education employment or training
hikki is someone who is a shut in and doesn't leave his room/house for long periods of time
so pray tell, how do you not leave your room for long periods of time if you happen to be employed my dear madam?

No, not interested in men at all.

I dont know. Up to you to decided whether or not you think its natural or whatever. I grew up with both my parents and they have a great marriage. I just never liked boys.
<comment>
not a single boy?
what's the closest you ever got to one?
<comment>
Hm. Based. Yes, quite based.
<comment>
Nope. I had my first crush on a girl in 4th grade. Wasnt sexual or anything obviously since I was like 10 but I had all the stereotypical childhood crush feelings. And I am a gold star lesbian, in fact self brag but id make a new tier up for me. A platinum star lesbian. I have never held hands with, kissed, let alone had sex with a boy.

Fat ugly autistic men can be charming to women
<comment>
He ate part if his foot in front of a bunch of people

What world are you living in where he is charming to women? He has no wife. He was accused of rape for even mentioning something related to sex in a way that a woman could see it. He is proof of the blackpill. Even with all his success and clout he is still completely unwanted by women.
<comment>
The only way to disprove the blackpill is to post universal replicated aggregate data that shows that all 18-25 women everywhere prefer short and ugly faced men to tall handsome men.

Have you watched his speeches? He's very charismatic. He's just asexual.
If the blackpill just means that ugly people exist, then everyone is blackpilled.
<comment>
The blackpill is two things
1) using evidence rather than feelings to reason
2) men miss out on real genuine romantic love of 18-25 that gives life meaning unless they are tall and handsome.
Nowhere is anything about "existing" mentioned, retard turdwhore dishonest fecal smear insect moron idiot bimbo toilet water herpes blister.

He's just asexual
No he isn't, where did you get that idea from?
<comment>
By definition, ugly men are less preferred than not ugly men. That's just a truism as long as ugly people exist.
He could easily get a gf if he wanted one. He has lots of fangirls and he's very charismatic.
<comment>
Exactly, the blackpill is iron law. Women will suck off baby raping pedochad and praise him for being morally righteous on account of his appearance while seething at incels for being short and ugly.

In 2013, I was discussing Stallman's love life with a friend. 
While I deeply admire Stallman for his intelligence, passion, and contributions to free software, I argued that, due to unfortunate realities, there are probably very few women who find him attractive, and that's probably why he's single. 
My friend disagreed with my position, and argued that there are probably many women who have a romantic interest in Stallman, but he turned them down because they weren't as passionate about free software as he is.
So I decided to email Stallman and ask him basically that, though not in those words.
Stallman's reply didn't really resolve the question, but I nevertheless appreciated that he took the time to reply. 
He said that he "only occasionally" had the chance to meet a special someone, though he didn't elaborate on whether that's because most women don't find him attractive, or because his career in free software advocacy leaves him with little time for socializing-and I thought it would be rude to press the question.
He also said that he would not reject a woman "just because free software was not her main concern in life".
So hey, if you're interested in a date, you should consider emailing him. I am sure he would appreciate the directness.

from the same thread:
No.
Like James T. Kirk
who's deep love for his ship always came first, RMS has passionately devoted his life to an ideal, Free Software. This has, unfortunately, meant that he did not have the spare cycles to focus on social graces that are needed for a long-term relationship.
It's unlikely he will ever get married. Decades ago, at the first Free Software Conference, I was introduced to RMS and his awkward blurts, "Come with me. Folk dancing now." I admired him, but I still found him prickly and hard to be with. And next to him, as a perfect foil, was Linus, socially adept and likable, inviting folks to get a beer. Linus had the social skills that would later lead him to become happily married, but he lacked RMS's idealism.
The conference tchotchkes were printed with a Linus quip that showed the difference: "Software is like sex: it's better when it's free." Linus had meant "free" as in "free of charge". RMS could have made the same joke, but he would have meant "given freely". Where Linus just wants life to be easy and fun, RMS has a consuming, fiery zealotry to defend every individual's freewill.
I remember RMS's clumsy attempts to hit on one of the women in our group. She later confessed she found his manner "creepy" and even said it had disgusted her. And she was a woman who admired his ideals. Perhaps, like saints, prophets, and all who proclaim some absolute moral ideal, if we accept their message, it's even harder for us to accept that they have a messy, base, and human side.
RMS's manner doesn't seem to have changed much over the years, but I wonder if someday he'll put down the halo, mellow out, and charm some woman with his folk dancing skills. I could see him getting married, perhaps to a grown up geek-girl (geek-crone?) as crotchety and stubborn as him.

This is an overly elaborate way of saying Linus was tall and handsome in the face and "RMS" was short and/or ugly in the face.
Simple as.

Think again, anon. Simple as.

I mean, not really. Before you can even get to that point you first have to have basic hygiene which stallman doesn't have. Dude bites his toenails. He is genuinely disgusting so I can believe that no woman wants to date him. I've never met him irl but I assume he probably smells bad.
<comment>
nope, cope. tall and handsome vs short and ugly. simple as. women suck off heroin addict homeless garbage juice dick cheese tall handsome abusechad behind the dumpster where he sleeps and lick up the crusty off his smelly rancid penis. all women would do this for a tall handsome man. nothing more to it.

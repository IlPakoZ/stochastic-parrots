Humans are monsters and their puppet master is Satan. Computers are just tools with no master.

when people say the human brain is like a computer but then take the analogy too far and start acting like the brain functions as a computer it makes me very angry

Incorrect. There is no turning them off, there is sleep mode and hibernate, but no safe way to turn off. As soon as you turn a human off they begin to fail. After just a few minutes there is massive data loss and the main processing unit disintegrates.

When people pass out it's like they are getting turned off. People are diff from computers though since they're organic, you can boot up an old pc after it's off for a year like nothing happened. Not so with humans

What about people that have their heads cryogenically frozen in hopes of future resuscitation
Also woah.. that's just like saving a hard drive by putting it in the freezer am I right

Exactly. I wish cryostasis was legit and not just turning your brain into a spiky icecube :(

Has anyone here lost their virginity to a prostitute?
What was your experience like?
Also, anyone willing to talk about sex worker services in general is welcome.
I life in a state where prostitution is illegal, and I do not want to pay a woman to have sex with me.
However, I would pay a woman to cuddle half naked with me. There are "professional cuddlers" you've probably seen news stories about, but their services are advertised as fully clothed and platonic, like they're wearing jeans and a sweater. What I wanna do is lie down with a woman in bathing suits or underwear, and spoon and embrace her for an hour or two.
I think that's you dressed as a woman for your sexual gratification, looks pretty good though.
I think thats an image I saved from 4chan because you can reverse search it. Nice to know youre gay though.
Nice to know you have been posting your gay bottom since 2020

You should really take a moment and start asking yourself why you see males in this sort of images. Its not normal.
I did. It felt very good
Were you comfortable? Do you have any advice?
I am asking why you took a pic of yourself, or saved a picture of a guy and posted it for years
Were you comfortable?
I was extremely nervous, like literally shaking and it took a while and a lot of patience from her to get me ready 
Do you have any advice?
1. Find a professional with experience and real good reviews 
2. Don't be too nervous, it's not such a big deal, just go with the idea to have fun
I mean, if you look at the filename you can tell pretty much which post I saved it from, its still the unix format without any modifications.
I saved it because I found the image attractive. I dont believe its a man.
Yes, she had a smelly pussy and I couldn't cum. The ones I saw after the first were better, though unless you're loaded you're going to be dealing with crackheads and heroin addicts.

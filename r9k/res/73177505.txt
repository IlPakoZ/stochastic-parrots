I've noticed that my parents really don't have much patience for technology. If something doesn't work immediately they throw a small fit.
Why is that? They were alive before the advent of personal computers and had to spend minutes loading programs off tapes.

Maybe they're frustrated that you still live at home and they take it out on defenseless electronic devices?

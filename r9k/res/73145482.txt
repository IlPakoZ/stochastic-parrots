What are YOU doing to help save western civilization from collapse?

teaching English in Japan then getting married to stay on a spousal visa

Why would I want to save a rotten empire already eaten by the jews from the inside out? instead of trying to save a lost cause, we should be focusing our efforts on preventing them from doing it to the next one.

Moving to the woods and becoming self sufficient. Bring every book I can, transcribe everything I deem of worth, bring all internet happenings and as much of the pictures and webms as I can on a ton of hard drives, etc. I will then die alone, or, if god wills it, teach the old world to any who may stumble upon me. This world is too beautiful to let it go. I can't move on. I'll never have to.

It can't be saved. The best move to is go somewhere else

Just existing and giving my opinion. It helps a lot when you see people sharing your views. Once you lose hope, you lose everything. I wont let down whoever will be born and grow up to be powerful enough to change the world

brainwash kids to demonize the concept of the 'west'

There's only so much you can do to save the civilization built on house of cards. 
I do have plan how to do it, but I know that both left and right would reject it. So currently I'm politically homeless and just watching the society slowly dig its own grave

It's unlikely that I alone will be able to prevent the collapse of Western civilization. I don't really have an answer for how to prevent Western civilization from collapsing.
What I do have is a way to rebuild from the ashes , and I work tirelessly around-the-clock to make that happen.

Glad you asked. I waste away watching Youtube 16 hours a day and will never reproduce. The West will be saved in no time!
<comment>
I'm making sure to sink it further by not only refusing to contribute but by claiming everything I can in order to suck from the gov resources that soon women will be paying for as a majority.

Nothing. The people are stupid and unable to be saved. Anyone of value already knows what to do.

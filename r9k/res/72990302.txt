Splendid to be here so early. Repost from last thread, since I replied very late last time.
Have quite a bit of work to do for uni as the semester draws closer to its end. Wish I had good study habits. Grade school and high school were so braindead boring that I never bothered formulating study habits.
Cut myself two days ago, the most cuts I've ever done. Just really felt like crap, I think I overinteracted with people and got anxious from the semester ending. Had a beautiful sunset through the window and Radiohead (I know, faggy) playing. Cuts all over my left wrist and below the shoulder. Felt nice until today, I feel rough, to say the least. Plus, the weather is gray and bleh, which doesn't help. 
I will reply again after some more replies show up here. Thank you all again for your participation, I greatly appreciate it.

Hey, hope is everyone is doing alright. I hadn't hurt myself in a week but I relapsed today. Apart from that, I've been trying to reduce my internet time. I also made some mushroom stroganoff earlier today which really turned out nice, surprisingly. 
What other boards do you guys browse and post on btw? R9k used to be my home board but it's /mu/ for me now. I used to come here a lot for the feels posts but I don't see much happening outside race bait and porn spam nowadays
<comment>
What other boards do you guys browse and post on btw?
Been a /w/ and /wg/ enjoyer for a looonnggg time now.
Overinteraction can be scary, I wish I could talk easily with people but I can barely even force myself to now >_&lt;
What kind of stories did you have in mind?
Stuff like her being lost in a city and finding her way around without going mental.
I tried talking to that friend again but he said he isn't in the mood to discuss with me, so now I feel extremely bad
sucks that your friend group didn't recognise your effort
It was more than them, the entire community ignored and laughed at me for making no progress, another thing I will never excel at, yay :)
I slept over 12h last night so I'm very happy, but my envy anger and sadness won't go away, I'm beginning to hate our creator for fucking me over so hard with genetics
Just want to be able to make drawings well, meet people internationally without so much anxiety and learn their language, but even with years of effort nothing has changed
<comment>
Should I turn back to Christ? I don't know if my faith can be genuine anymore, but all this nihilism has not been doing good for me. I'm so angry, I just want to cry, be left alone or lash out at myself or someone else. I don't want to work or study anymore.
<comment>
hey prog. didn't say hi in the last thread, i think, so... hi. how are you holding up?
Hey, hope is everyone is doing alright.
i'm good. mostly. bit annoyed about something workrelated, but i'll manage. 
I hadn't hurt myself in a week but I relapsed today.
it happens. any reason? 
Apart from that, I've been trying to reduce my internet time.
not a bad goal to have. are you successful?
What other boards do you guys browse and post on btw?
browsed /tg/ and /v/ a for a long time, but had no interest is those lately. started posting on /cm/. haven't done so in a while. no threads i'm interested in and the constant spamming of ai-generated-art and trigun threads is grinding my gears a bit. talked to hoonianon in the suicide boy thread and took it to /cut/. that's how i ended up here. the irony of me using yua/diy to identify myself is not lost on me. 
I don't see much happening outside race bait and porn spam nowadays
it gets tiresome, doesn't it?
Stuff like her being lost in a city and finding her way around without going mental.
sounds cool. did you have a city in mind or is it a fictional one? 
I tried talking to that friend again but he said he isn't in the mood to discuss with me, so now I feel extremely bad
you tried. what else can you do? are you open to discuss it when he feels like it or are you done with that?
the entire community ignored and laughed at me for making no progress
jeez. what game is it?
I slept over 12h last night so I'm very happy, but my envy anger and sadness won't go away
nice. i don't think i can sleep that long anymore, but if you feel good after waking up, then that's the right amount of sleel. have you ever considered meditation? it helps to deal with this kind of negative emotions.
<comment>
bump
sorry for being quiet today but I'm soo tired 
anyways, I'll try to reply to you shortly
<comment>
How are you doing today?
shit but the same
Any plans for today?
nothing
When was the last time you hurt yourself?
this morning and want to do it again.
Why did you hurt yourself?
Is there anything bothering you right now?
Nothing better to do, hate myself. Life is dead end. Never will be loved.
<comment>
hiya /cut/ how are we all? I got a guitar pedal for my synth :3
<comment>
Should I turn back to Christ? I don't know if my faith can be genuine anymore
does it really matter if it is genuine? if it helps you cope, go for it. if it doesn't, then don't. why were you drawn to religion/faith in the first place?
but all this nihilism has not been doing good for me. I'm so angry, I just want to cry, be left alone or lash out at myself or someone else. I don't want to work or study anymore.
it might not be nihilism, but depression. depression can be preceded by phases of anger and aggressiveness, especially in males. 
hey, catbro. did you have a hard day?
hihi. i'm mostly fine. how are you?
I got a guitar pedal for my synth
nice! what can you do with it?
<comment>
what else can you do?
Knowing him, he'll be back soon enough. So I guess I don't need to worry very much
what game is it?
Splatoon. You may lynch me whenever you feel comfortable.
have you ever considered meditation?
Yes, but I'm unsure if it would do very much for me. The last time I tried it made my anxiety worse oddly enough
Which pedal? Those are fun to mess with
All good mate
<comment>
Knowing him, he'll be back soon enough. So I guess I don't need to worry very much
that's good. hope you can somewhat help him.
Splatoon. You may lynch me whenever you feel comfortable.
it's a cool game and i really dig the art direction, but i'm more of a single-player-guy at this point and i don't know if it's worth it if i'm not playing multiplayer. and if the community is as cutthroat as you make it out, i probably should stay away. ^^ are you streaming?
Yes, but I'm unsure if it would do very much for me. The last time I tried it made my anxiety worse oddly enough
i think that's normal in the beginning and you have to bear with that for a while. again, i'll ask my friend. he's buddhist and has been doing it for a while. he even has discord sessions with a canadian monk.
<comment>
are you streaming?
Yeah I would so people could VoD review me, but those didn't help. Was always no mic. Just wanted to get better at something, like usual.
Forgot to mention earlier, the cities I were thinking of were places like Vienna, Nice, Rotterdam, Olympia, Mobile, Warsaw, Talinn, etc etc
I want to give her life and it hurts that I can't >_&lt;
Yesterday, when I posted and went to bed I also forgot to mention that I thought that thread would die in a single post, seems I was right. Always been good at guessing things like that, it's odd...
<comment>
did you have a hard day
yes, I feel me mentally well but physically exhausted, so much so that even my mind is tired
<comment>
how are you?
im good pretty tired tho 
nice! what can you do with it?
make noises i enjoy :3
Which pedal?
HM-2w by boss :P really like the heavy distortion it makes
<comment>
Nice, I like /wg/ too
I didn't scroll 4chan for like a week which was good enough. 
it happens. any reason?
I tried to explain this to a doctor years back but I get overwhelmed with sadness often and because I'm impulsive and lack control, I have no option but to hurt myself, just to ease the pain a little. This morning was one of those mornings.
browsed /tg/ and /v/ a for a long time, but had no interest is those lately. started posting on /cm/. haven't done so in a while. no threads i'm interested in and the constant spamming of ai-generated-art and trigun threads is grinding my gears a bit. talked to hoonianon in the suicide boy thread and took it to /cut/. that's how i ended up here. the irony of me using yua/diy to identify myself is not lost on me.
I can see how that happens. I remember, I only ever used 4chan for /mu/, /fa/ and /a/ up until the blackpill stuff started to take off and people kept on posting eggman's face on other boards. It was all just so painfully relatable so I went down the rabbit hole of trying to find friends here by joining tinychat and skype groups. I've essentially been here since
it gets tiresome, doesn't it?
It does, but at least this thread is relatable and weirdly wholesome
i'm good. mostly. bit annoyed about something workrelated, but i'll manage
What do you do for work? I only work part time at a call centre but it still stresses me the fuck out
<comment>
How are you doing today?
pretty shitty, just sitting at my dest staring at the lyrics of NF - Hate Myself on loop for hours, fiddling with one of my knives, scratching my skin with it. but im not gonna cut. not right now.
Any plans for today?
it's 2207 as i'm writing this, so not for today, but tomorrow i have to obviously go to school and get through the day somehow, and i have a lot to do so not much time for plans.
When was the last time you hurt yourself?
3 days, 23 hours and 22 minutes ago if you don't count torturing myself at the gym this afternoon after barely having eaten all day and having only slept just shy of 4 hours last night
Why did you hurt yourself?
i kinda lost track of all my emotions, i'm just generally miserably sad and i want to feel something other than that fucking numbness. i also genuinely like pain and i love the sight of blood flowing down my skin
Is there anything bothering you right now?
family, mostly, they just can't get along with each other or me. they can't seem to understand the concept of proper communication so my sister is just whining to get what she wants (she's almost 11 ffs, grow out of it already) and she's the 4th child so my parents have gotten bored of parenting, therefore i have to try calm her down if i want to keep as much of what little is left of my sanity as i can. there are also other problems, like loving someone who just isn't into me, but still does things that make my fucked up mind think he might like me a bit. and much much more but i don't have the energy to go into details now or event collect them properly.
i should really sleep now, but i've been dealing with insomnia lately so here i am instead. i plan on going to the gym tomorrow too, so i'm gonna need the sleep a lot. also food so i don't just collapse lol.
<comment>
Yeah I would so people could VoD review me
it takes guts to put yourself out there like that. too bad it didn't work out the way you wanted.
Forgot to mention earlier, the cities I were thinking of were places like Vienna, Nice, Rotterdam, Olympia, Mobile, Warsaw, Talinn, etc etc
I want to give her life and it hurts that I can't >_&lt;
are you thinking about art portraying her in different places or should it be like a webcomic taking about her being in a specific place? what about writing about her exploits first? maybe someone else could do the art.
I also forgot to mention that I thought that thread would die in a single post, seems I was right.
i think sludge tried that a few times. well, someone has to be right with their prediction at some point, i guess. ^^
i had such a day not too long ago as well. hope you are warm and comfy. take care. 
make noises i enjoy :3
that's about as much as i understand about it. thanks for being considerate. ^^ any new music for me?

I get overwhelmed with sadness often and because I'm impulsive and lack control, I have no option but to hurt myself, just to ease the pain a little. This morning was one of those mornings.
so nothing immediate but a recurring state of mind? how often do you have these kind of episodes? 
until the blackpill stuff started to take off and people kept on posting eggman's face on other boards. 
maybe i saw them and agreed to a point, but i don't remember that. at least it didn't leave an impression. 
so I went down the rabbit hole of trying to find friends here
i didn't come with the intention, but there are so many good people in this thread and i like to imagine that we are. or could be, at least. 
but at least this thread is relatable and weirdly wholesome
isn't it? i wasn't sure at first and i needed some time to appreciate it, but now this my favorite thread on this site. catbro is so supportive and his positive attitude is contagious.
<comment>
I'm sorry that you relapsed today, best wishes to your health. I'm also a big fan of /mu/, I would post on the chart threads often. I bet you listen to some good tunes.
The thing is is that it isn't difficult for me to talk with people, it's just that I have to fake my nice and cordial attitude when talking to people. I ran out of the energy to fake it well, but still interacted with people. Makes me feel sick. For the time being, I'm in a similar situation as you, being unable to talk to most people. I hope that you are doing well yourself, and not overinteracting yourself.
For me, faith helps to a degree, but it won't instantly help you, it requires involvement in the church. I am a Catholic, and I often find the faith to cause as much anguish as not beliving caused. However, there is reasoning behind the pain, whereas nihilism just makes you feel totally defeated. Do what you will with this experience. Good luck to you in your spiritual journey. It will be hard, but if you commit, you will find your worth.
I'm hanging in there, uni's just beating me down a bit. Sort of just want to isolate from everyone. I'm pushing through it until summer comes around. Thank you for asking. I hope you are in good spirits, Yuanon. We all appreciate your presence here.
I understand the numbness sentiment, it really eats into you when it gets bad. I hope that going to the gym helps mitigate that. NF is a solid choice, from what I've heard, never listened to him. Coping through music has been my strategy for the past five years, so I understand the sort of stuff you listen to.
I will pray for you all tonight, I wish the best to all of you.
<comment>
Art in differing places, mainly. I'd love to make a comic/manga with her, but anyone else doing the art is 100% out of the picture, since it would feel like I'm doing none of the work and it would invalidate me trying to learn to draw and man I want to smash this monitor right now why can't I do anything right
Going to lie down now I cannot take this anymore
<comment>
any new music for me?
Just check out the swans pretty cool stuff
<comment>
so nothing immediate but a recurring state of mind? how often do you have these kind of episodes?
Yup and it's usually random. Some days, it's every day for a week and other times it's once a week
i didn't come with the intention, but there are so many good people in this thread and i like to imagine that we are. or could be, at least
Yeah, I understand what you mean. That was my mentality back in 2015 when I first came here.
isn't it? i wasn't sure at first and i needed some time to appreciate it, but now this my favorite thread on this site. catbro is so supportive and his positive attitude is contagious
True, it's hard to find nice people on the internet nowadays
I like to think so. What genre of music do you like the most?
<comment>
cont. 
What do you do for work? I only work part time at a call centre but it still stresses me the fuck out
it's a bit weird. i'm working at a corner store with an attached postal/parcelshop. i'm there for the postal/parcel stuff. 
I only work part time at a call centre but it still stresses me the fuck out
i can imagine that. are you calling people or are people calling you?
it requires involvement in the church.
hm. i don't know about that. i think you also can just take what you need from faith/spiritualism without need for an institution. the jefferson bible is an example of that, i think. there can be great value in community, but i'm always wary of people trying to control your thoughts and life with their ideology.
I'm hanging in there
that's good to here. what will you do in summer?
hope you are in good spirits, Yuanon. We all appreciate your presence here.
again, thank you for your kind words, but sometimes i think i'm overbearing and getting too involved or too nosy. i don't know. 
but anyone else doing the art is 100% out of the picture, since it would feel like I'm doing none of the work and it would invalidate me trying to learn to draw 
i see, i see. sometime i think that writers don't get the credit they deserve and there are great duos, like uderzo and goscinny, but i understand that you want to create and bring your character to life. sorry for agitating you.
will do. thank you. ^^
<comment>
Yup and it's usually random. Some days, it's every day for a week and other times it's once a week
i have something similar. i get these depressive episodes that are, mostly initiated by this overwhelming feeling of "why are you still trying?". these can last a few days up to a few weeks. i usually just try to stoically weather them somehow, but these threads helped me a lot. 
True, it's hard to find nice people on the internet nowadays
yeah. being genuine and honest about and to yourself makes you a prime target. it's weird how little trolls and shitposters these threads attracts. there are some, but they are few and far between. i shared a lot of stuff about myself and people don't seem to hold it against me. i'm grateful for that.
<comment>
In recent times I've been going to the gym a few times a week, the only person I talk with is the owner and he's an extremely kind person. I have no irl friends, and was a shut-in from 2021-2023, and the ones I did have forgot about me despite my persistent efforts to talk with them. I don't handle my fear of abandonment well, so being isolated is for the best.
Can't seem to nap so I'll try occupying my mind with something else :/ Maybe hug a pillow and watch a film, unsure, I need to find something that won't make me go into an abject fit again (while keeping this open tab ofc)... ;_;
its weird how little trolls and shitposters this thread attracts
Very odd indeed, the other day I looked at some reddit sh coping subs (horrible site) and it's safe to say they, while having good intentions, fail to give many people attention and unconciously promote the people with insane problems, which encourages others to fall in
<comment>
these threads are always so sweet, thanks for being here.
<comment>
I never bothered formulating study habits
Same. I'm in college but I still feel like a high school kid.
I also made some mushroom stroganoff earlier today which really turned out nice, surprisingly.
Did you take a pic? I love stroganoff, but haven't eaten it in a long while. Never tried to make it myself.
What other boards do you guys browse and post on btw?
I actually used to browse /lgbt/ before because I felt I had some kinship with some of the people there. The whole thing about hating your own body, seeing a stranger in the mirror and wishing you were different. I feel like I get how androphilic non-passing trans men feel, and I think they're really funny and good at body horror self hating vent art.
 I don't see much happening outside race bait and porn spam nowadays
It's a shame I relate the most to some of the anons here when this is probably the shittiest board on this website. I feel like I'm going through a shitty big city underground district full of prostitutes, insane beggars, addicts, criminals and flashing fading neon lights.
thabk yuo cat bro o7
Hello yuanon hi
I hope helvetica is fine. Maybe his family are helping him get over his self harm addiction. That's what I would like to believe anyway. I hope he's on the path to happiness.
I've cut myself today because I fucked up something that's going to make me really anxious for the next month. I don't want to elaborate a lot but I relied too much on someone, they did something wrong on accident, and it was my fault. At least I worked out today, and maybe I'll bake some cookies, but I've done nothing useful today really. Just another wasted day.
<comment>
I will pray for you all tonight, I wish the best to all of you.
read over this part for some reason. thanks, prog. that means a lot.
I looked at some reddit sh coping subs (horrible site) and it's safe to say they, while having good intentions, fail to give many people attention and unconciously promote the people with insane problems, which encourages others to fall in
the only time i engaged with that site was to look at elden ring memes. can't get a grasp of how to navigate it and i don't really want to either. maybe reddit is just too big for such threads and that upvote system might actually do a number on people with mental problems. the (you)s you get here are addictive enough. 
that they are. thank YOU for being here. 
hey, bile.
I relate the most to some of the anons here when this is probably the shittiest board on this website.
i do too, but i'd say that title goes to /gif/. can't hide threads fast enough on that board.
I feel like I'm going through a shitty big city underground district full of prostitutes, insane beggars, addicts, criminals and flashing fading neon lights.
yeah, but there's that weird little place you love that made you come to that district in the first place. full of people you'd never thought you'd like or have anything in common with and that are always happy to have you around. 
I hope helvetica is fine. Maybe his family are helping him get over his self harm addiction. That's what I would like to believe anyway. I hope he's on the path to happiness.
i hope so too. same for hoonianon and muddy. hope muddy doesn't think she burned any bridges, though i think she got herself banned on purpose, didn't she? maybe she'll be back. 
I don't want to elaborate a lot
that's fine as well. you don't have too.
At least I worked out today, and maybe I'll bake some cookies
that's a good day in my book. what kind of cookies do you have in mind?
<comment>
can't grasp how to navigate it and i really don't want to either
Had to force revert to the old layout, any change they make is cancerous on usability. Up and downvotes encourage a culture of shutting down those with opinions thay differ from the chamber. Some sides get drowned out and the schizos get louder and louder. Great site for stuff such as language resources, for what they push it as, not so much since it heavily contributes to the echo chamber culture many people get trapped into these days.
Hopefully Muddy is fine, she should be. I doubt a self-ban will deter her.
I watched Ghost in the Shell for a second time, got me anxious a bit, but I enjoyed it more than I did the first. 
Also looked up any potential local language classes out of curiosity, even though I 100% would be too anxious to attend. Little progress expected in nine weeks and a very long drive (50m to and from). Not affordable as well. The towel is close to being thrown...
<comment>
I made dark chocolate chip cookies. They tasted nice. I wish I could share them with someone. I still have some left over dough so I will probably give some to a random person like I did last time.
<comment>
it's a bit weird. i'm working at a corner store with an attached postal/parcelshop. i'm there for the postal/parcel stuff
That sounds comfy. My old job was me working as a cashier in a small corner store
are you calling people or are people calling you?
People call me... to constantly whine and complain lol
That's wise. I hope yoy get to escape out the intrustive thoughts, completely
Unfortunately not :(. I always tend to forget to take pics
I actually used to browse /lgbt/ before because I felt I had some kinship with some of the people there. The whole thing about hating your own body, seeing a stranger in the mirror and wishing you were different. I feel like I get how androphilic non-passing trans men feel, and I think they're really funny and good at body horror self hating vent art.
I think me and you quite similar as in hating own bodies/face. What do you dislike about your body btw? 
It's a shame I relate the most to some of the anons here when this is probably the shittiest board on this website. I feel like I'm going through a shitty big city underground district full of prostitutes, insane beggars, addicts, criminals and flashing fading neon lights.
It's interesting because I wonder if people who live such lives are truly browsing this board or if postss pertaining to those stuff are merely people roleplaying and baiting. I'm betting on the latter though
<comment>
The "femanon here" posts are obvious bait and they get sometimes hundreds of replies and bumps from oblivious anons trying to argue with smoke and mirrors. The wojaks are also very unsightly. But I was mainly talking about the race bait threads and hentai/porn picrel spam. It is very tiresome.
What do you dislike about your body btw?
The usual. Bad proportions due to shortness, thin wrists, small hands, ugly feet, baldness. I think I have a bit of gynecomastia too. And my thighs are disproportionately fat next to my skinny calves due to high muscle insertions. I look pretty freakish. But I feel like I would be ok with my own body if I had a handsome face. I do feel prettier whenever I interact with people normally but the illusion comes crashing down when I look at my own face afterwards. Especially if I have candid photos taken of me, I look at them and cry remembering how disgusting every single one of my movements were and how putrid my mouth and face looked when I talked.
<comment>
Tell me about your cutting fellow cutsisters.
<comment>
any change they make is cancerous on usability.
that goes for any change to any app. the developers probably have to justify their paycheck somehow.
it heavily contributes to the echo chamber culture many people get trapped into these days. 
it's a little bit better here in that regard, but even here i sometimes can't tell if i'm talking to a human anymore and not just some buzzword spewing bot. 
I watched Ghost in the Shell for a second time, got me anxious a bit, but I enjoyed it more than I did the first.
good movie. fantastic animation. script maybe isn't the strongest, but i'd have to rewatch it to say anything conclusive. what made you anxious? have you seen vampire hunter d: bloodlust? 
The towel is close to being thrown...
shucks. 
I made dark chocolate chip cookies. They tasted nice.
now i'm jealous. i want some too. ^^ 
I wish I could share them with someone. I still have some left over dough so I will probably give some to a random person like I did last time.
you are such a sweet and caring guy. i'm sure whoever will get it is going tonbe very happy.
That sounds comfy. My old job was me working as a cashier in a small corner store
sometimes it is. most times it isn't. it's quite demanding to accomodate both corporat and customers demands. it's maddening. and mistakes can get very costly. 
People call me... to constantly whine and complain lol
better than the other way around. at least you can expect some sympathy, not like the poor saps who have to pester people.
 I hope yoy get to escape out the intrustive thoughts, completely
that's not possible, at least not entirely, since those thoughts are linked to my body(image) issues, and that thing will stay with me til the end, i'm afraid. 
but now i have to go to bed. it's getting quite late again. good night, you lovely people. see you tomorrow. in this thread or the next. bye.
<comment>
1970's progressive rock. Basically rock, but with more instrumentation and more diverse themes. Lot of good bands out of that era and genre. Yes, Supertramp, Genesis, Camel, Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant, and more. My favorite album out of this bunch is probably The Yes Album, by Yes. Highly recommended.
 i think you also can just take what you need from faith/spiritualism without need for an institution
You are totally right about this. I've been raised by hardcore Catholics that always emphasized the importance of the institution of the church. However, you most definitely don't need the institution; I was speaking from my experience. It probably is much healthier to enter the faith on your own terms, with your own methods of engaging. 
that means a lot.
My pleasure. You lot deserve the best.
Unfortunate. I imagine that covid participated in the whole shut-in period. Having friends forget about you is the worst, have had that happen plenty of times.
I hope you can keep talking to the gym owner, seems like a very nice fellow for talking with one of the patrons. Best wishes to you on any potential future social endeavors.
<comment>
what made you anxious
Well, almost anything remotely artistic reminds me of my failures, so that's why. Will put Vampire Hunter D on my list.
can't tell if i'm talking to a human anymore and not just sone buzzword spewing bot.
Trust me, that isn't an issue only here, most of the web has become corrupt with that twatery. Which makes it very hard to make friends online anymore, sadly. You can hardly find people to form good personal connections with, likely because many people today do not value relationships as they once did

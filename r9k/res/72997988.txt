After breaking something in the house (a dumb-headed shove from frustration, and not thinking the object was so brittle), my parents are implying I need therapy. I feel that this is opportunistic, but to my benefit or expense, I don't know.
I'm a standard NEET who doesn't socialize much, so I can understand how this concern has grown.
Considering I likely don't have much choice, what should I expect? What are the do's and don't's? How often is therapy an excuse to say "take these pills, do what people expect of you, and feel nothing"? When and how often do therapists disclose what you tell them to those around you? How can I use therapy to actually better myself? I guess I'm just afraid of getting caught in a loop of abnormal behavior and stronger treatment, or otherwise becoming unrecognizable to myself.
I should note I'm prone to getting tongue-tied, so explaining myself and speaking what I'm thinking and feeling leaves me prone to getting my words twisted or simply being dismissed as making excuses.

You get out of therapy what you put into it. I went to therapy once a week for a couple of years but I rarely ever talked about anything that actually troubled me. Just sitting there talking about your day or whatever is a complete waste of your time and money. You have to be willing to confront things you aren't comfortable with.

The people most likely to commit suicide are the people that nobody cares about

I don't have a job/will never get one, I regularly shoplift, and I spend most of the money I do get on trafficked asian prostitutes who can't speak english. How is anyone benefitting from me existing?

To who?
Corporations? State?

you cover the cost of insurance for most companies and pay the third world pimps off, i don't see how you don't contribute to society at all

The pimps that own your chink whores would probably be pretty bummed if you stopped giving them money

Somebody needs to be the wagie that cleans up all projectile diarrhea that gets sprayed in the poop stalls

Fuck insurance. and I am broke now so I'm not even paying chink whores. i may occasionally if I get some cash but I won't have any for awhile.

The people most likely to commit suicide are the people that nobody cares about
So why do they waste time with suicide prevention ads and putting the auicide hotline everywhere?
because even if nobody cares about you, you still have value
I don't have a job/will never get one, I regularly shoplift, and I spend most of the money I do get on trafficked asian prostitutes who can't speak english. How is anyone benefitting from me existing?
To who?
Corporations? State?
you cover the cost of insurance for most companies and pay the third world pimps off, i don't see how you don't contribute to society at all
The pimps that own your chink whores would probably be pretty bummed if you stopped giving them money
Somebody needs to be the wagie that cleans up all projectile diarrhea that gets sprayed in the poop stalls
Fuck insurance. and I am broke now so I'm not even paying chink whores. i may occasionally if I get some cash but I won't have any for awhile.
Aw man, i hate this fucking planet.

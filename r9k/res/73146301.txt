Be me
retarded incel in my 20s
finally find a gf
we're happy together
she keeps talking about her times in a certain country (which is weird)
she has weird kinks she wants me to do 
feels really awkward and forced
find her boyfriends through scrolling her facebook
didnt bother to delete her relationship status
last guy was from that country and she lived with him there
has it on steam as well
suddenly realize im a rebound
suddenly realize we're together because the last dude got tired of fucking her
suddenly realize she's never really put any effort for me like she did for the other guys
relationship becomes extremely toxic
start hating her
break up with her a few times
she finally blocks me
gets with another dude 2 weeks after that
spiral into months long depression
finally start feeling somewhat ok after almost 1 year
are all women like this cause im not willing to repeat this again, what a waste of my fucking time, a few good moments weren't worth all of this

most women are like this yes, the more experience they have sexually and romantically, the more like this they are.

i didnt really do all of that, she kind of approached me and we got along, i said we broke up multiple times cause she always cried over me and got together with her, she also acted really jealous which was probably just projection cause she was cheating on me

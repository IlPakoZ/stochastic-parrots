How are we supposed to create a better world if we are not true to ourselves? We often hide behind a facade or moral code that doesn't align with our true nature
Blame the world for having social constructs. You are judged for being yourself if it does not align with the majority.
Simply, we will never truly be ourselves and the world will never be better, it will only adhere to people who spend all their time on the internet

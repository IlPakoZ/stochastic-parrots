meet girl online nearly two years ago
become obsessed with her
not sexually, just obsessed with her because she's a based skinny white girl acknowledging my presence
she ghosts me for being a loli hentai appreciator (?)
Two months later
stalk her
find out she has a bf
oh
she was *definitely* keeping it a secret on purpose
"Oh, well I'm just a private person haha nevermind all the times we were talking about dating and I implied I was single, whoops!"
I can't even be mad at her because she never technically led me on. I just feel so worthless and mad at myself because I clung onto this girl who doesn't and will never want me for years now. I'm such a fucking simp faggot loser!!

Oh, to be clear, we've texted relatively consistently since I contacted her after she ghosted me. I was never trying to break up their relationship but damn I'm still upset that she will never ever like me :(

That's really unfortunate, Anon. Here's to hoping you find somebody.
I wish I had the brain power to say more than just NPC-tier dialogue.

what's the worst thing you've ever done? avoid incriminating yourself.
I took creepshot videos of some girls a couple years ago. I've deleted them now, but I really regret it. That was too perverted, even for me.

A girl asked me out in middleschool so i beat her into a comatose(its ok she woke up a few days later) because i thought she was shit testing me. 
Thinking back i should have just said yes even if it was a shit test because what if it wasnt I could have lost my virginity but i chose violance and now im a 28 year old virgin incel.

Got into one of those anti pedo groups in Twitter, I don't actually know what I fucking expected, I saw some really twisted shit 
The amount of illegal shit shared by Arabs and Indians is gigantic. Japanese and chinks too.

This is some tame bullshit. Jesus fucking Christ.
I had a neighbor who was an aging Vietnam veteran that none of the kids in the neighborhood liked, myself included. 
So one day me and my friend decide to pull a prank on the old fart. We take one of these type of pull string firecrackers and super glue one end to the bottom inside of his mailbox and the other end we glue to the lid. Then later that day we notice an ambulance over at his house. Long story short when he opened it the pop sound scared him enough to give him a heart attack. We knew he had PTSD but we didn't think it was that bad. Serves him right though for being such a dickhead. I'm just glad that the cops never figured out it was us. My friend was all bent out of shape by it but thankfully he kept his mouth shut.

Who else here /retardmaxx/? I wear graphic tees, glasses, and skate shoes, and also am overweight. I try to keep it simple and not overthink, maybe just doing my best and not aiming too high. It's comfy and suits me well because I can't succeed as an adult so might as well stay comfy and accept being retarded instead.

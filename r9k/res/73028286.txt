Yep, put a fork in theology. it's over. There is no refuting this.

Retard doesn't realise that by proving God's existence you disprove Eric's existence.
<comment>
this is so retarded. you get so hung up on the ontological argument of whether religion is fact or fiction, that you miss the point altogether. this goes for both theists and atheists btw. Spirituality isn't a matter of fact, it transcends that.
<comment>
There's no evidence of spiritually existing. You're a dumb nigger

2. Evolution isn't real. Most of you fucking idiots don't even understand how it's "supposed" to work
<comment>
The evidence is the history of spirituality and religion that have existed as long as humans have existed. We crave spiritual satisfaction, whether through religion, self searching, or even science.

What a load of gay word salad. Post evidence
<comment>
is this a silly riff on Kant's critique of the ontological proof

Eric isn't real because there are no miracles that prove his presence

physics isn't solved you fucking retard, everybody agrees the standard model has major problems
<comment>
Universes where life cannot exist cannot be observed so of course this one is the only one where you can be an observer you retarded dipshit.

physics isn't solved you fucking retard
you are the biggest idiot on this planet

There is ZERO proof of multiverses/infinite universes being a thing, you absolute midwit. Believing in multiverses is the same as being dogmatically religious. Multiverses is your religion.
If there is no evidence for it, it is not meant to be entertained just as we don't entertain the idea of Zues.

How can you prove that a situation that allows life is engineered to be that way when nothing points to that and if it hadn't been that way no one would be there to observe it's lack of ability to contain life?

None before the mass production of cameras
Overwhelmingly in countries that have a culture of Catholicism/Christianity
What a remarkable coincidence.

I believe jesus and therefore god may have been trans. Jesus is always shown with long hair and a dress or a diaper on.

False, retard. Here's an example:
one of the constants deals with nuclear force. Too weak = universe would only have hydrogen. Too strong = universe would only have heavy elements. In other words even with INFINITE time and dumb luck, you STILL wouldn't be able to create life aka not even a single celled organism because you literally wouldn't have the proper materials to work with.

gods existence only makes sense if we assume we have free will that god can't predict, even though in theory science could advance enough to entirely predict how the brain behaves
pretty fucking stupid
<comment>
Your logic is retarded. Doesn't act as proof for or against a creator
<comment>
You haven't answered shit, all you only said is if it were different enough that there would be no life there would be no life and that statement is basically meaningless.
<comment>
Dumb faggot. If the universe were any different, we wouldn't have life. Given that there's only evidence for one universe, it means you'd only have ONE chance to get it right which is fucking retarded to believe happened through sheer luck
<comment>
if "god" can't do what we can, he's worthless
<comment>
life is too complex and finely tuned to just arise so it needs a creator
n-no the more complex creator just is!
sasuga theist desu
<comment>
Your opinions are worthless and would neither prove nor disprove anything
<comment>
It's not about complexity, you fucking retard. It's the fact that you only have one chance to get the correct values. Holy shit, atheists are brain dead LOL
<comment>
we wouldn't have life
but you're postulating that life exists outside the known laws of the universe, God. God does not follow the laws of physics.

Pay attention. I'm saying if you look at this universe at face value and from the perspective of an atheist, you'd only get ONE chance to get all the values correctly which is dumb as hell to believe.

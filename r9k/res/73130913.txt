If you're a strange person, should you attempt to be normal or should you double down on the weirdness?

double down
always go for it 100%

If you're female, double down.
If you're male, attempt to be normal.
If your particular strangeness makes attempting to be normal futile, seclude yourself forever.

you might not be as weird as you think you are, some niggers might call you weird but someday you'll find your people(if you try)

I'm tempted to say double down, that's what my gut says. Overall some eccentricity and charm can make people love you but you'll rub some people wrong for sure. It's not good for day to day surface level interactions but people will notice and remember you for sure.
It's like there's two types of odd, like hey this guy is interesting vs I think I'll sit over here away from this guy. You have to have enough social skills to notice how people respond to you.

I just got approved to be an uber driver. Don't really plan on doing it because I drive a nice fancy 50k car, and don't want some normgrel animal to ruin it. Any robots on here do it though? How awkward is it when people try to talk to you?

I can't imagine why people want to talk to uber drivers. I take an uber 1-2 a week and I say hi, give a smile and then put my head phones in and take a nap on the drive

Those rides are chill with the drivers a lot of the time too, although you would be surprised, especially older people and groups
I did it a couple of months last year on the side. I was alright, got me to socialize more but you can really hate the grind and bs of it. Sometimes you earn next to nothing and are wasting your time you would rather be elsewhere. Sometimes you have disgusting or rude passengers, sometimes they are annoying. With a $50k car I would be hesitant as you are going to be killed on depreciation from mileage and probably upkeep/repair expenses.

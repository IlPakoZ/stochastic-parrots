I've lost a lot of weight recently, and this is the first time in my entire life where when I look in the mirror it's not a humbling experience nor am I saddened nor am I disgusted. This is the first time in my life where when I look in the mirror I actually like my reflection. I don't look horrible in pictures...I like how I look. It's a crazy feeling kinda like I'm in a new body. moral of the story...loose weight fatcels and see the beauty that lies underneath.
congrats anon, I am truly happy for you
tl;dr: I deserve rope...
don't feel bad anon, you were just delusional and made a mistake, it could happen to anyone
whoops meant to make a new thread..can't delete so it'll just stay sorry op.
You broke that girl's heart just to try out some different pussy. You're walking proof that men are incapable of real love and I hope you never have another loving relationship again
I've only ever swore upon god twice in my life before yesterday. I've kept both swears with the entirety of my will, heart, and being behind them. Yesterday I swore I would never be in a relationship again. you don't have to hope OP, I'll make sure of it. It will be the price for my actions.
congratulations, broski! it feels great, doesnt it? i also lost of a ton of weight recently. im still skinnyfat, but i still love lifting my shirt and just looking at my flat chest and tummy. the next step is to get fit. started jogging recently. cant wait till everything starts looking tighter. good luck, man! keep it up!
Good shit, just remember though that women only want fit chad though.
Besides from that enjoy you new body

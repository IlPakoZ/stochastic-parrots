Your thoughts on Gnosticism?
<comment>
decent aesthetics wrapping up even more anti-life cope than christianity

It's the only thing that makes sense desu
Christians:
wow the world is shit and unrelentingly cruel
but I already believe G*d is good so I will do mental gymnastics to prove G*d is good despite his world being shit :)
Gnostics:
wow the world is shit and unrelentingly cruel
that must mean its creator is evil
The temperament of G*d should be the conclusion, not the basis of your thought process. Christians think backward.

its a cope with the problem of evil. the problem of evil is evidence against a good god's existence, but there are alot of debates and arguements against an evil god, which are contradictory to gnosticism

what if i told you the world is neither good nor cruel but simply what you make of it and doesn't require some afterlife copev

It is better than Hermeticism, especially of the kybalion type

Your thoughts on Gnosticism?
decent aesthetics wrapping up even more anti-life cope than christianity
It's the only thing that makes sense desu
Christians:
wow the world is shit and unrelentingly cruel
Gnostics:
but I already believe G*d is good so I will do mental gymnastics to prove G*d is good despite his world being shit :)
Gnostics:
The temperament of G*d should be the conclusion, not the basis of your thought process. Christians think backward.
its a cope with the problem of evil. the problem of evil is evidence against a good god's existence, but there are alot of debates and arguements against an evil god, which are contradictory to gnosticism
what if i told you the world is neither good nor cruel but simply what you make of it and doesn't require some afterlife copev
It is better than Hermeticism, especially of the kybalion type

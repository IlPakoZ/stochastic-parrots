I suffer on, nofappers, through pain and hardship. I trudge along this muddrenched path of mine. This long, cold night never ends. These harsh winds never cease. 
The succubi never stop circling me above. The ghouls and the giants and the beasts of this Hell never stop leaping from behind rocks or trees or out of caves to attack me. 
However I was born for the storm, and I will not succumb to failure and defeat. This Hell will not be my tomb. 
I will reach Paradise. 
Robots, are you with me?
I will never give this up, will you?

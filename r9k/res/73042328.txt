I need some advice, frens. TLDR: My mother is a bum who takes all of my money.
My mom hasn't had a job in 5 years. She coasted through unemployment and all the free covid money, blew through every penny she ever saved, and still won't look for a job. She applied to one place this year, they of course ignored her, and she has done nothing since. Now I'm stuck paying all of her bills and our rent by myself, as someone with a minimum wage job. My money is slowly draining too. I'm honestly thinking of marrying a girl just as a way to escape this situation. What can I do here?
Give her a last chance if you feel bad for her. Idk whatever you determine an honest attempt to be. Have her look for jobs and send applications. 
If she fucks it up, change the locks and kick her out. Enough is enough.

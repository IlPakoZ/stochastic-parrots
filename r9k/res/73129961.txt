That's about it. Otherwise I'm successful in life and all my physical stats are great.
Mmm, new cope thread to find excuses to stop trying :). Off yourself.
Do you want a gf? or is it just an extra thing (It's great to have if i can have a great one i'm compatible with, but if not, then it doesn't matter)
Been trying my entire life, the things that are wrong with me seem to be unchangeable.
Go on, name some. I bet 0.7 xmr that you can change them with enough money and/or work.
theres more but im sleepy
Yes, but it's not essential to my happiness. At least not at my current age of 23. I'm sure if I'm still alone by the time I hit my 30s it'll be a completely different story.
link?
Idk I feel like I should put myself out there, but it all feels so pointless. You have to be a soulless emotional rock to get a hot gf if you're as good looking as I am, and for a good emotional relationship I'd have to date an average looking girl, which seems meh. I find it hard to have deep relationships with women since they tend to be way more vapid than men, but maybe I'm just shallow or jaded from meeting shit women in the past, idk
its winteiris on twitch
aw i seem like such an asshole self promoter now
disabled
brown
tiny
that's all i can think of, really, am i gonna make it?
nigger just download Grindr and catch HIV from some "femboy"
this is the truecel. everyone else here is fake as fuck. try being this brown man
what kind of disabled? what kind of brown?
Im hopeful that im gonna make it out eventually though
I was told im genuinely an asshole by someone who wouldn't lie to me and im realizing that my mask broke and im just a spiteful jaded hurt person.
I let myself get this way, but it isn't like this is what i wanted or liek it was out of nowhere.
Too many people have made me the third wheel / lead me on / gone cold on me.
MY family is kinda cold to me now, i dont have many friends left, i have never been able to land a real relationship anywhere despite trying , and now i can't even be a nice helpful person at work because im just destroyed in my head.
I am very self sufficient. can easily hold down jobs, always have a car, dont live with parents, im normal looking, in ok shape, im not short, i dress kind of shitty because i dont spend money on nice clothes, im jut a shitty personality now. 
Im trying to get my own place because my roomate are kind of shysters and their antics are making my headspace worse.
None. what is truly wrong if I only perceive things as what they are, traits as traits, occupation as occupation, the world as just as it is and nothing else? I simply perceive things and classify them efficiently. There is no inherent right or wrong: simply what is. AMBATUKAAAAAM
honestly your looks aren't anything to write home about but you're not hideous and you'd look better with better lighting and more sleep. i think your hair is nice and you have a pleasant voice. seriously stop staying up so late.
many others but those come off the top of my head
why would you want to be this brown anon
what's it matter to ya tho
mentally or physically disabled? genetic deformity or injury? brown like mixed race or hispanic or brown like a streetshitting pajeet?
Everything about me but idk if it's wrong
thanks for rubbing it in even more
and i cant sleep im too busy crying. i wish i had the money for surgery so a guy would actually feel proud to be with me
the only thing a guy needs to feel proud of is a girl who loves him. as i said, you're not hideous.
Everything's fine with me except
I'm tall, about to get a degree in mathematics, fit, am classically trained in multiple instruments, speak multiple languages, have a plethora of active hobbies, am a great conversationalist. 
Yet i have never had a single friend. People call me too serious, despite also saying i have a great sense of humour.
i actually think you're really brave to show your face online when you feel like you're ugly. that takes a lot of charisma and that's something i would never even think about doing.
Not sure i will make it out of this year lads. It keeps getting worse each year, i'm not sure i can take this anymore. As soon as i finish playing games from my backlog (yes, things like this give me will to live even if i don't enjoy them anymore) i will probably end my life.
Good luck and stay safe out there
HAHAHAHA! EVERYONE POINT AT THIS LOSER AND LAUGH! KEK!
Even writing these out isn't getting me down to much. I'm okay with the life I live and I'm content with having friends and family who love me.
little big brained tiny mutant. injured mixed SEAsons.
sounds worse than it actually is, all things considered. i'm pretty good at hiding most of this and my biggest problem is most likely the lack of initiative.
dude we r basically in the same boat
do you like platformers and shooters and hate anime?

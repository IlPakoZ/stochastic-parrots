she murdered 3 people at 17 what the hell is her problem
Damn shes good looking
Also so what? Men her age do the same shit and worse, what is their problem
its unbelievable easy to do a spree killing with arson you brainfuck
i live in latam and it happens quite often
she's from stupid town
its just that its a teen girl.. how does she even do something so evil
youre being disingenuous. who expects a teen girl to kill 3 people in arson. it never happens. name more than 2 ill wait.
yeah you're right, it's normal for teenagers to burn buildings down
You know exactly what I meant and yet decided to completely disregard what I just wrote. Of course its less common for girls to do and of course its fucked up that a teen did something like this retards. But this thread wouldnt have existed if she was a teenage man. Get over the fact that OP only posted this because he romanticize the idea of changing/saving her just like all of those idiotic girls who obsess over criminals that men on this board constantly mock despite blatant hypocrisy 
And now its your cue to answer and gaslight me into thinking that this was not the intention at all.
i dont want to gaslight you or shit talk you i only made this thread cause i thought it was odd a chick would kill 3 people in arson i havent seen it before. tell me how much you hate me and want to kill me damnnn ill wait
Its easy to spot a psychopath. They always have those dead eyes.
Why do I think of vore when reading this thread oh my god I still have feelings for that bitch :(
i see your point but how do you know people will act on their impulses if they look dead behind the eyes. i feel like most people like that just suffer through life without ever doing anything extreme/.
its not that simple

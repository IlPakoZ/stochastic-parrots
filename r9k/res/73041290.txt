I have some things I should probably do, will you help to motivate me? I don't need to do all of them now, or even today, but I don't want things to pile up.
Vacuum the house
Wash some clothes
Washing-up/drying-up/putting away
Trim my nails/toenails
Exercise
Cook a meal

buddhism is to pacify the masses, vamachara and aghora is peak Hinduism and positive and negative karma does not exist it is only matter and people who are aware of the dharmic warfare beneath the materialism mind control

Those are basic tasks you should carry out in your daily life, how can you feel unmotivated to feed yourself and trim your nails? They should come to you naturally because they are made to ensure your thriving in your life.
Take it from emperor Marcus Aurelius:
"At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: "I have to go to work - as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if I'm going to do what I was born for - the things I was brought into the world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?"
And you are a Hindu i suppose?

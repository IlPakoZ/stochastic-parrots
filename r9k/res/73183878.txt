If you feel like a failure in your 20s just remember that Hitler found out he was a great speaker and leader at 30 years old
He lived in a different time under different rules. Also there was only one of him. Show the aggregate statistics that show young love (18-25) is possible after 18-25 temporally. That is, that people over 25 are under 25.
That has nothing to do with anything, you dumb fuck stuck in your own self defeating loop
big fucking failure
You don't know what he did, the ADL pays shills like yourself to spread demoralization campaigns against anyone who looks for inspiration in life that doesn't fit your black ariel narrative

blah blah blah you folded like a bitch at the slightest pushback. that's what i thought, wimpy bitch.

Please remain angry, kikes.
It was either a fast death as nazi germany or a slow one as weimer germany. plus starting ww2 allowed hitler to bankrupt the shittish empire as revenge.
Indeed. But he had WW1 to shape and temper him.
We're all waiting for WW3 and there's little chance of surviving a nuclear war.

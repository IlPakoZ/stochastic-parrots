age
21 to 30
height
On the smaller side. Not taller than 165cm
complexion
Brown I guess if I have to pick one. But it's not a criterion for me.
ethnicity
Mediterranean. Turkish and Greek girls are pretty. But as above it doesn't really matter
hair
Not super short because I want to brush it for her but don't care about color. 
Just want a smol girl to hug from behind and give kisses to.
is this body type particularly "ideal" for men? pic rel, just a bit skinnier and very slightly bigger tits I guess.
just wondering because it seems like most men genuinely prefer chubby these days. or the common ideal, curvy but skinny.
A squeeze zone is nice plus chubby girls often have nice thighs too. But honestly I just like big tits and you find them more often on the chubby ones. But I had crushes on Petite a cup girls before too so it really depends.
now I just feel worse for not being able to gain weight lol. i don't really have any kind of squeeze zone bc not enough fat.
Don't assume every man likes it. A thin girl with a nice tummy is a rarity these days. Don't gain weight unless you are anorexic.
Skinny girls are much easier to pick up and generally have way nicer skin. You've got way more upsides, don't worry.
Your mom has always done it for me.
well I guess it is nice that when I wake up, usually my stomach is 100% board flat. but when I eat breakfast and drink coffee, it goes away lol.
I have oily acne-prone skin actually, but thanks anon.
I want a woman in her twenties, 5'6 to 6'0 in height, fair or ruddy skin with no tattoos or piercings. A single hole in each year for traditional tasteful earrings is forgivable. Ginger with long hair grown down to her butt. She should be a legit ginger with the orange eyebrows, pubes, and pits. She shouldn't shave or trim these areas either. Except maybe some light plucking of eyebrows to avoid the unibrow thing. She shouldn't even dare think of shaping the other two places.
Southern accent and country type interests are a big plus. But she should be feminine and have feminine interests. I want her in a dress most days, nail polish always applied to long natural nails. Your format is missing possibly two extremely important physical features in a woman. Fat is extremely disgusting even if everything else is perfect. My type has a small waist and large breasts. Ass is less important but still something I can appreciate. Broad hips are more important for creating the desired hourglass silhouette from the front. If she doesn't have the bone structure for this then give me heroin chic and I'll buy her some of those breast implants made of silicone instead of saline. Boobs are a must but they have to look natural. Better small than bolt-on.
Liking fat girls is a zoomer thing. Millennials remember a time when women didn't weigh more than men.
I would kiss and rub your tummy all day. Good that there are still girls with some restraint out there.
Ok, some more benefits
looks cute in my shirts way too big for her
more likely to have an hourglass figure
thigh gap, the most attractive thing imaginable
will get noticeably bigger tits when pregnant
thigh gap, the most attractive thing imaginable
I thought this was mostly a meme for men? any time I've seen it mentioned, guys say that only women care about it and that they prefer thicc thighs. but I guess you're an outlier then haha
I'm a millennial, not a zoomer. I feel like the whole obsession with "thicc" (aka obesity) women is just a massive cope from society at whole, since most people seem to be at least overweight now. It's endlessly depressing how rare skinny women are becoming. Almost as sad as the tomboy genocide.
are you a millenial who's 30 or younger? those seem like the best guys imo.
18-30 (I'm 29)
Don't give a shit about height as long as they're not 6'0+.
As long as they're not a nigger or Asian idc.
Don't care about hair colour as long as it isn't that ugly frizzy negro hair.
Definitely not a meme. It's sexy because it shows she has female non-tranny hips and she isn't a fatass cow.
I'm 30, on the spot. And I wanna clarify that by "skinny women" I didn't even mean necessarily underweight BMI wise, but normal as well, since the scale has shifted and normal is seen as rail thin now. 
Keep being thin (at least, healthy thin), you're loved for sure.
age
&lt;25
height
5'2 to 5'9
complexion
Dumb redundant question since ethnicity is also asked
ethnicity
Asian. It's not a looks thing. I'm Asian myself and come to realize that a studious overachieving Asian girl is the only type I can get along with. Everyone else is too degenerate, lazy, and hedonistic.
hair
Don't care
23

Pale
European
Don't care
This is my favorite one itt
age
Same age as me so around 22 - 26
height
Same height or shorter. So 5'7 or below. But this REALLY doesnt matter to me. This tends to matter to women.
complexion
Not important but I like darker women
ethnicity
Black or latino.
hair
Curly &amp; Black. I really love how many black women do their hair. Honestly the most unique &amp; beautiful of all the races.
dont feel bad about it. I dont care what everyone says i'm never going to be a chubby chaser. I love a girl with a fit body. I love seeing that line on the belly. My girl is like this and she always shits on herself cause people have made her feel like she needs to gain weight when I think shes perfect. Toned althetic/skinny bodies are superior.
age

age
Anything under my own age as long as it's legal (so I guess that is 16 to early 30s right now)
height
Huh...short?
155cm or less, I'm a manlet at 173cm, so I'd rather have a bit of height difference so her cunt doesn't go drier than the Atacama desert because "He's short (-er than a basketball player)"
complexion
light skin preferred. Can be tanned, as long as her natural skin is light.
ethnicity
Race is easier, ethnicity would give too specific. White or east asian. Perhaps some paler North africans/middle easterners.
No gypsies.
hair
long and straight? But overall as long as it's her natural hair I'm OK. (e.g. I hate women with straight hair who do whatever to make it curly and vice-versa)
As for colour, prefer black, but I'm fine with anywhing.

I want to isekai myself in a world where the two of us can be together forever. Life feels so much worse now that i met you and lost you. Why did you give me hope? This is so cruel
god I could run scalpels across your face you whiny little scamp
I would break your weak arm bitch. Eat shit and die, in that order
god the desperate attempts to portray some sort of tough character. the contempt I have for faggots like you is indescribable. there is nothing more dishonest than a total disposal of your self in favor of an idealized character. you gave up. this is your refuge. kill yourself before it gets too tiring to keep up this circle of deceiving yourself and others.
I'm sad for your loss anon but I bet you stayed with her like a kid for more then 5 years and when oopsie daisy happened there is no legacy. her only legacy is being some nutrition for the soil, doo doo for the plants. Her bloodline has ended thanks to you wimping all day. How does that feel? filthy sodomite
i would unironically break your face if we ever got into a fight lol
You mean yourself?
You are a schizo :(

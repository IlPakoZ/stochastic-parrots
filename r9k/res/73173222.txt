work night shift
nothing happens at work
just play league on my phone all night
live in shit hole city pod for 1k a month
hours got cut from 40 to 32
homeless shit trash garbage everywhere
tall, white, not fat, nice hair
no gf
completely alone
haven't had friends since I was 16 (22 now)
have started drinking every night
lost at poker even though I played perfectly but got btfo by 7% chance (I have to play and grind and poker because that is the only way to make more money and the only social interaction I get)
just tried playing game of league and can't even play properly
still haven't even put together the bed frame, said I'd do it today
don't want to be alive anymore but too lazy/scared to kill myself
lost her years ago, haven't been happy in years
about to have a total breakdown after writing this
just listen to 'radiohead - videotape' or 'lowroar - friends make garbage, good friends take it out" on loop everyday
don't even enjoy my days off, I just sit in the dark all night
I am the epitome of failure and regret, failed normie maxxing
This was a blog post, but I don't care.
So now that the dust has settled, what am I supposed to do? I can't even be a leader and lead my own natcap revolution or something.
inb4 college (too stupid probably)
inb4 learn trade and forced to work 60 hours a week
inb4 hit the gym (would still be alone)
inb4 make friends (not possible due to no preexisting network)
It's just over isn't it. Let's be honest here.

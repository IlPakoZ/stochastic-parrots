hey, get off your high horse.>>73017461 (OP)
personalities are things that can be complicated-yes, you can grow your personality, also, a personality can be hidden by social condition (shyness)

have no social life outside of job
job is interesting but I cant use on the women in my job because they do the same thing and therefore wouldnt be impressed

Girls are nasty. They make me nervous when I try to talk to them.

what do you do for a living? origonally

start by identifying the things that you find profane and build a life to the exaltation of the pure &amp; that which avoids the profane

Flight instructor.
Officially, I have been a pilot since I got my PPL, but no one thinks of small, single engine planes when you tell them you are a pilot at a bar, its always 
oh which airline?
Which is understandable. 
I am not OP btw (and for some reason my normiephone does not let me submit apostrophes on /r9k/ and only /r9k/, other boards work fine with that)

you probably have a lot of ideas that come from being knowledgeable about planes, &amp; actually most likely quite a LOT of personality. Now, I have to tell you the TRUTH-so it might not be what you want to hear, BUT picking up girls can be DANGEROUS; other guys can be DANGEROUS.
You'll probably do quite well in bars that are aimed at college age. Like places that will have bar beach parties &amp; stuff. Probably what you want to do is not go ALL IN right away, obviously you're probably looking to get laid, but if you can calibrate to actually get the minimum sexual success while gaining social PROOF, getting invited to parties &amp; stuff.
Really, I was a lifeguard &amp; it's a really stimulating job with a lot of actually novel &amp; interesting stuff that happens. And the peak of this crapht, if you want to call it-is DEFINITELY parties. You'd be surprised how little game guys have at parties

I really hate this shit
I don't like to fuss around with stuff I don't like. it's a waste of time to make up reasons to be upset all the time.
but, yes, neurotypical people are so savage that they act like hating things is right, they'll make up shit until their face turns blue.

Thank you, I definitely need to find the college hangouts. Unfortunately I live in a place that is more well-known for being old and at least a half hour drive from many things. I need to find out where the local community college kids go party, but Im guessing the answer is in their high school friends houses.
My biggest problem I think is that when I dont focus on work, I can get very comfy doing absolutely nothing, been this way since I was a kid. Gotta force myself out of it.

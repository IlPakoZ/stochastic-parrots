anyone else eat sticks of butter when theyre sad?
i started a couple weeks ago and its really helping, like more than therapy could ever do
i've never been fat and always had a fast metabolism but its starting to really fuck up my toilet
i've tried to quit but i cant stop and im worried its becoming more of an addiction now
i feel like a faggot doing it over and over but i seriously cant stop.
any advice??

No but I eat spoonfuls of virgin olive oil or coconut oil
Are you eating real butter? It shouldn't be that addictive if it's actually sating, are you skimping on other food at the same time or something?

I eat plain butter every day. It's no surprise at all that it's helping your mental state, and it helps mine. Animal products, especially the fats in them, usually help people a lot with mental problems and just about every other problem they could have. It works better the less altered everything is. Less additives, less processing, no pasteurization, no cooking, no freezing, etc. I was very neurotic, stressed, diseased, etc for 25 years and it all changed massively for the better within months because I ate different food. The crazy thing is I'm not even eating the ideal food. I don't have access to the totally unaltered raw stuff from healthy animals

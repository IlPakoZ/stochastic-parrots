Why are even the most masculine white men starting to adopt a more feminine role in society?
<comment>
Learning to accept their places. Imagine where we'll be in 5-10 years.

Those type of men weren't masculine to begin with. If you want the truth only like 30% of men are truly masculine

can a white boy be as cute a tranny as a biological girl?

Stop watching porn. Even just the way you talk. I'm a complete fucking degenerate but just reading this shit makes me realize their are depths of the abysses so deep you don't even know which way is down anymore.

Masculine is more mind than muscle.
<comment>
Because society as a whole thinks masculinity is toxic

Even my asian uni flatmate had more body hair and a bigger pp than me. What the hell did they put in the water?

How big are you son?

just i was wondering
i dunno
i just think asians can be as cute tranny as a biological girl
usually there's a lot of cute tranny like that in thailand, vietnam or the philippines though 
here in south korea or japan, there are quite a few trannies and cross dressers that is prettier than biological girls

3.3-ish inches, curse of being perma-skinny I guess. Feels bad man ;_;
<comment>
for example, this is a boy from japan
i guess the jap boy was homosexual 
i heard a rumor that he was raped by a straight man by the way

3 inches HARD? Or soft

I'm a shower, not a grower, anon-kun - it's always 3 to 3 and a half!

some can but the majority are ugly. when they start young they're usually hot.

white people have broad-shoulders, large-skeleton, and have a lot of body hair
so it's hard to be a woman-like tranny i guess
now imagine an arab, black, or indian guy being a tranny..

Why are even the most masculine white men starting to adopt a more feminine role in society?
Learning to accept their places. Imagine where we'll be in 5-10 years.
Those type of men weren't masculine to begin with. If you want the truth only like 30% of men are truly masculine
can a white boy be as cute a tranny as a biological girl?
Stop watching porn. Even just the way you talk. I'm a complete fucking degenerate but just reading this shit makes me realize their are depths of the abysses so deep you don't even know which way is down anymore.
Masculine is more mind than muscle.
Because society as a whole thinks masculinity is toxic
Even my asian uni flatmate had more body hair and a bigger pp than me. What the hell did they put in the water?
How big are you son?
just i was wondering
i dunno
i just think asians can be as cute tranny as a biological girl
usually there's a lot of cute tranny like that in thailand, vietnam or the philippines though 
here in south korea or japan, there are quite a few trannies and cross dressers that is prettier than biological girls
3.3-ish inches, curse of being perma-skinny I guess. Feels bad man ;_;
for example, this is a boy from japan
i guess the jap boy was homosexual 
i heard a rumor that he was raped by a straight man by the way
3 inches HARD? Or soft
I'm a shower, not a grower, anon-kun - it's always 3 to 3 and a half!
some can but the majority are ugly. when they start young they're usually hot.
white people have broad-shoulders, large-skeleton, and have a lot of body hair
so it's hard to be a woman-like tranny i guess
now imagine an arab, black, or indian guy being a tranny..

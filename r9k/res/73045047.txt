Loads of depressed chuds would be better off dying in a war then drinking themselves to death. at least you will experience comradely for once
Before modern weapons people used to actually like the military a lot of the time. It wasnt as brutal as it was once portrayed. A 5000 vs 2000 roman invasion battle might end up with like 50-100 people dying before people break ranks and they run off. a lot of the people killed will be people straggling.
Once the spirit of the people ruling has been broken you end up surrendering eventually. That all ended when belt fed machine guns got invented

apex fallacy
again
its like they never learn
<comment>
Imagine being a jew. It must feel good to be able to send the men of a country off to die like dogs for you.
<comment>
This is literally what Ukrainian foids were doing before the war started though
<comment>
If a war broke out where I lived because another county invaded or whatever then I'd just start my own faction and fight both the invading force and the government. I mean yeah I could leave and go be a refugee with all the roasties and live the same boring shit life in a different place or I could try my hand at becoming a warlord. I expect a lot of Ukrainian men probably have the same mentality, especially in groups like Azov, they don't really care for the Ukraine government, they're just taking advantage of the chaos. Even if Russia retreats I don't think Azov will stop fighting, they'll probably transition to insurgency.

no charisma
looks like pic related
thinks he can get even his grandma on his side
<comment>
You realize that "muh charisma" is just a meme, right? Normies follow who can provide their needs, it's literally that simple. Are you going to follow a charismatic psycho with nothing or are you going to follow a chud who can immediately offer you cans of beans and gallons of water right away? 99% of people will say the latter.
<comment>
charisma is nothing
Get a load of this chud
<comment>
h-hey everyone I have some soggy beans and some water from that stream over there....... f-foloow me.... to victory.....
some chad pushes him over and takes his supplies and then goes back to following charismatic leader
This guy thinks a bit of stream water and some chud grub will make him a warlord. Hes that delusional
<comment>
If you are in a war torn country and you are starving and thirsty you are not going to follow a charismatic guy over a guy who can indefinitely provide you those needs. Sorry retard.
<comment>
people steal stuff. 
ill overpower them
no you wont
ill shoot them
in that scenario you are already dead if people are killing each other for their food
ill offer them food
in this scenario everyone is dead if theres literally no food apart from the few tins of soggy ebans in your moms pantry and a few gas bottles filled with water
<comment>
Thank you for showing us that you don't know how state-building works
<comment>
You are living in some dreamland thinking you can become the leader of a state because you have a few tins of baked beans. What in the fucking world is going on in your head, brah?
<comment>
Why are Mexican drug cartels so successful?
<comment>
Nice strawman. I was making a providing a general example but you already knew that and are just trolling
<comment>
Because its a paramilitary group full of ruthless psychopaths. the type of people that would annihilate you if you had even 10 cents worth of groceries and there were none other in sight
if you arent charismatic you arent winning over even the lowest level, saddest, weakest foot soldier
<comment>
be women in 2020
dominate most popular sectors of culture and societies
has been part of the defense of countries for decades
some even being defense ministers with the excuse of being less violent than those dirty dirty males
meaning that they can also cause wars if acting irresponsibly
but will they pay for the consequences of those actions? Let's found out! 
Zelensky was voted mostly by women
An progressive jewish actor who had some dirty story behind him
Ukraine is far from a patriarchal country
It was literally the birthplace of FEMEN one of the most radical feminist organization to ever exist
who they themselves protested violently for the female draft
at the same time it protested more and more privileges
The Zelensky incompetence with dealing with the geopolitics of his region + the incompetence of those same defense ministers who some were also females caused the tensions in which erupted the war on Ukraine
soon as some hardship caused by them happens most women run away like cowards
they can do it
they got away with it
Now tell me why women should have rights if they given the same obligations and status as children.
Why should women have access to managing the state with they have the possibility of running away of the country as soon something that they themselves voted, goes south? 
Also I have to remind that women, because of bob and vagene, has a huge influence on popular discourse, because they can shame men into also voting after certain politics. So they are literally the destroyer of countries
<comment>
This retard actually thinks people join drug cartels because El Chapo or whoever the fuck motivate them really well with persuasive speeches or some shit lmfao.
<comment>
el chapo will only hire the best charismatic ruthless leaders, and they will do the same, and they will do the same, and they will do the same
No chud who is socially anxious, a coward, weak, and thinks that having basic supplies in a pantry means they have value is going to be accepted in any of these circles, even the bottom rung ones
If you stepped back and had a look at the state of your life youd stop fantasising about making it in the cutthroat world of total anarchy in a wartorn nation. Go play some pokemon and pretend you are the master of that world, bud.
<comment>
Bruh you think people follow El Chapo because he is charismatic and not because they are impoverished and that he objectively provides immeditate money and protection for them. Do you follow what your McDonalds manager says because he is charismatic too? No, you just need the 15 dollars an hour. Admit you're retarded and move on.
<comment>
Hes a chud so he thinks about the logistics of the loser footsoldiers that are hired as fodder to be killed rather than the logistics of how an actual paramilitary group is run
Its over. not even got the brain power to imagine a hierarchy of a anarchist micronation. And yes theyre all ruthless high IQ charismatic people. Not miguel whos popped 3 people in an afternoon and will be dead himself in retaliation by dawn.
<comment>
You think state-building is surface level politics. Nobody who originally followed El Chapo followed him because he was persuasive or he had whatever the fuck parliamentary politics type shit you think really runs society, they followed him because he objectively knew what he was doing in the drug game from years of experience and he offered them immediate money. It was purely business, just like nearly everything else in the world is.
<comment>
Lmao you only see el chapo and he made it to the top because he snuffed out 10,000 competitors. I would eat my dick if el chapo isnt a complete charisma overlord
<comment>
It goes beyond charisma. If el chapo had a chud skull nobody would know his name. Hes short but his charisma and face made up for it. Height doesnt mean shit when you dont have to fight anyone yourself. Looking good and demanding presence means everything, however
<comment>
Well said anon. BTFO that foid
Indeed, women destroy every nation they have any sway over. Theyre simply too soft for any leadership role. Democracy was a mistake, its not how things are meant to be done. Just look at family structure, pure dictatorship with the father in charge. We need to be reminded of our roots
<comment>
Yeah, that's why beady eyed hook nosed old Jews run the world, they must just be very charismatic! It totally has nothing to do with the fact that they are simply genius businessmen and bankers.
<comment>
Pre-modern warfare had more people die of attrition and diseases than actual fighting
Slavery was the most likely outcome for you being captured (if you weren't executed, and you better hope they didn't try to torture you first)
Siege battles were atrocious for both sides, and if a city fell before surrendering it was brutally sacked
Most casualties in a battle were post routing, where cavalry was used to basically execute anyone fleeing (or capturing them for slavery) until they couldn't catch up (good luck if you are not on horse to flee lol)
And more brutalities that would take up half a book at a minimum
Have you ever looked up a history book before?
<comment>
??? The talking point is starting a paramilitary group in an anarchist wartorn nation from the ground up. You are talking about generational preservation which is cheating. Its over for u
<comment>
Ugly shadowy introverted Jews literally rule the world and and eat your children with impunity and you think they don't because they throw some demagogue in your face and you lap it up thinking he's your leader and he's the one building everything and running the state. Just fucking Lol. Go vote Trump, he's really funny and charismatic! He makes you feel really good when he speaks and he's so relatable too!

The fuck are you on about. You're chimping about because youre realising that when you are starting from the bottom nobody will listen to you if youre ugly and timid
<comment>
In an anarchist wartorn nation the guy who can provide food, water, utilies, and protection will be followed over a super charismatic guy who can't provide those things. Yes, often times the first guy is charismatic too and that's definitely a plus, but that is not the main reason people are following him. Only a handfew of religious fanatical crazies actually prioritize the words of a charismatic speaker over their own safety and survival. Survival simply takes precedence and it is the main thing that binds a civilization together in the first place. It's the same reason why a Communist who absolutely hates his boss still wakes up in the morning everyday and goes to work, not because he likes him or thinks he is charismatic, but because he gives him money, which is directly tied to survival in our Capitalist society. 
So then the question is, who dictates and prints the money? Who owns the banks? Who owns the bosses? Hint: It's not fucking Trump or whatever other charismatic speaker you think runs things.
<comment>
he thinks a chud with supplies wont get overrun but the charismatic guy whos harbouring 100+ ruthless people in a multi level hierarchy
Youre honestly an idiot
<comment>
If shit truly hit the fan then that charismatic guy isn't going to gain a single follower if he literally has nothing else to offer but his speeches and manipulation. People with actual skills will gather around whoever can allow them to continue build whatever they need to without worrying about starvation or disease, and that person will be the guy who has food and medicine stockpiled in abudance.
<comment>
N-nobody will have tins of beans and stream water except for ME!
Honestly you are garbage and you cant admit you have nothing to offer in your happening fantasy
<comment>
Even if all I really had was a few packs of water and cans of beans in my cabinet, even if you were right about this (you're not), you realize that would still make me better off than the average person who is not prepared in anyway for food and water scarcity and has less than a weeks worth of supplies in their cabinet? Do you know how survival works? Do you know that human beings need food and water to survive? That they need medicine for their diseases?
<comment>
Bro if the world ever gets to the point where you think having a few bottles of water is a prized commodity you are already dead because el chapos demon foot soldiers would have killed everyone in a 100 mile vicinity to forage in peoples chud bunkers. You are honestly crazy and disconnected from this world. your IQ is too low to even imagine what a future crisis situation could be like.
<comment>
Why dont those men just refuse to die in a war?

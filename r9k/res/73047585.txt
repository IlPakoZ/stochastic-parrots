i fucking HATE coomers and porn addicts

Porn addiction isn't real. It's a symptom of bigger problems.
The only cure for "porn addiction" is to cure the problem that's causing it.

This fags projecting. Ive been jacking off to the same vanilla shit for 12 years now. I regularly jerk off to fully clothed women dancing on a streaming app/tiktok, never once have I jerked off to some weird depraved shit.

violent gonzo 
Guarantee the person who is posting about this has no idea what gonzo porn even is. Also I bet you 10 dollars they're just parroting something Gail Dines has said (Gail Dines talks about gonzo porn a lot without even knowing what gonzo is), who is literally never accurate btw.

Escalation of behaviour is real and the hedonic treadmill is real.
Porn is highly stimulating. By consuming it regularly, you get used to it. At that point, you require more intense variants to achieve the same level of stimulation as before. Repeat this enough and you are left with a laundry list of fetishes, a warped sense of what sex is and depression.
<comment>
My fetishes now are pretty much the exact same now as when I first developed a sex drive. No matter how much I see cuckshit or violent BDSM porn spammed here, I'm still not remotely into them.

I only read erotica because porn just seems disgusting to me
am I allowed in the cool kids club or am I still too degenerate?
<comment>
Except no, because I've never went beyond vanilla porn. Anything beyond that does not suit my tastes. So my sense of what sex is not warped at all.
<comment>
Good for you. You are the exception.
The frequency of pornography consumption has been shown to predict various negative outcome measures in humans. A representative Swedish study on adolescent boys has shown that boys with daily consumption showed more interest in deviant and illegal types of pornography and more frequently reported the wish to actualize what was seen in real life.

This is schizo shit. Im starting to think that the tradlarping chudtards that push "PORN IN LE HECKIN WHITE MALE HOLOCAUST" thing are just trying rationalise their own fucked up fetishes.
99% of people who watch porn are just normalfags that watch vanilla stuff on pornhub, probably twice a week on days that they arent having sex with their partner for whatever reason.
Coomers are either just mentally ill weirdos (like us) trying to cope or more normalfags with high sex drives and its better that they watch porn instead of spreading diseases and cheating on their partner.

Porn is extremely predatory. It takes our innate human desire to reproduce and twists it into something incredibly addictive, unproductive and mind-altering.
That's the depravity of jewish minds for you. Take something wholesome or natural, and turn it into a sick, twisted mockery.

Congratulations, one piece of research about something by somebody that happens to (maybe) conform exactly with your preconceived notions. I totally give a shit.

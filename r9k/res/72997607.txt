How do you deal with oral herpes? Do you always disclose to people that you have it, even when asymptomatic? Or when you meet a random person at a club?
I think I got herpes from making out at a club, so it's just the common oral herpes.

Zinc supplement, topical propolis gel, invisible patch.
Works for me.

Never say 'I have Oral Herpes' you retard. Just say you have cold sores, everybody has 'oral herpes', but they're colloquially called cold sores. People will avoid you like the plague if you tell them you have herpes, but be chill with cold sores because they are retarded.

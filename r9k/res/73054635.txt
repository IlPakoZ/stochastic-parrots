The world population is now 8 billion. According to liberals and normies the more random people being born the more likely it is that a Leonardo da Vinci, Isaac Newton, or Nikola Tesla is born. So where is he?
And over 1 eighth of them are Indian, let that sink in
His name is Elon Musk, chud.
As some anons can't stop saying
imagine the smell
On the off-chance that he was born. He was probably bullied in school for not being a good boi and now no one will know about him.
You can attain more social status nowadays by opening an account on tiktok and farting into a jar
Somewhere in Asia or Africa being ignored and doing drudge work.
You have to remember that the most insightful, intelligent, and greatest contributors to our society never got laid. And so they never had kids to pass on those genes.
Nah that wrong. Quality > quantity. The more people, the more boring and generic everyone ends up.
The less people there are, the more memorable the ones that are around will be.
They always reappear. Somehow. Like gays
According to capitalists and boomers that's not true though. Quantity = quality.
Leonardo da Vinci
Not an Indian
Isaac Newton
Not Chinese 
Not African. There's your answer.
That hypothesis would make sense if intelligence and behavior weren't genetically determined and the "tabula rasa" and "free will" were real. They're not though.

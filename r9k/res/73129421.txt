In your opinion, is it ever possible to escape inceldom? I consider myself a incel scholar of sorts. I like to indulge in thoughts of why we became this way. In my case, I think my biggest problem has always been lack of opportunities to even try to date women. Then I look at my friends over the years and their girlfriends just sort of seemingly "materialized". One day they had no girlfriend and the next they did. Also, with me being 30 and strongly preferring women within 4 years of my own age, women in that age seem to expect men to have at least a modicum of dating experience. 
I think the most doomed incels are the ones who have like nothing positive going for them to hang onto. In my case, I can fall back on my physical fitness. I am actually in great shape but I have severe social skill problems(gymcel). Some incels don't even have that which I think is what causes those absolute spastics that go off the rails. I am not at all shocked that they go off the hinges. What do you guys think? Is it possible to escape inceldom and if so, how would you go about it? In my mind, I envision one day having a family of my own but then I think about all the mental illness problems I have(extreme specific anxieties that gimp me in certain adult functionalities). What can we even do?

The only three possible paths of escape for real incels. Everything else is simply a meme
<comment>
True incels that will stay this way forever are extreme statistic minorities and incels aren't 15 percent of the population with majority of them being young adults just getting into the game.You have to be special kind of a fuck up to be a true incel.
<comment>
No I don't think its possible to escape inceldom, at least not in my case. My problem has always been that my looks are too bad for any women to be willing to get to know me. I have so much love to give but I never get the chance to show any of it. So the only way out would either for me to get extensive amounts of plastic surgery (basically I'd have to win the lottery to afford it all) or I'd have to meet the extremely rare woman who is willing to get to know an ugly guy. Neither seems doable.
<comment>
Yeah if they get some friends and get a life. It's more incidental, not done through will or direct work.
<comment>
You are forgetting RNGmaxxing. Whereas you just pray to whatever god and pray you find a woman that understands your shortcomings. To me, it always seems like women are way less accepting of a mans shortcomings. That brings me to another one of my issues. I don't really desire to bend over backwards for women but many dudes ARE willing to bend over backwards for women. So how do you compete against giga simps who are willing to flood women with gifts, services etc?

that webm
kek, context? Do you have more?
<comment>
this might be hard to believe, but the girls in that webm aren't there for you to speak to. they are there for chad to enjoy their pussies and mouths and assholes.

I'm not sure, if I had the answer I wouldn't be here anymore. I think the biggest thing to escape is to have positive experiences so you stop isolating yourself and demonizing other people. Many incels have traits like being ugly or bitter than tend to reinforce other people treating them poorly, and therefore the incel's isolation tendencies and poor view of others. It's the same reason why hot girls tend to have such lax, positive attitudes, since the world treats them very well by comparison. 
The best way to escape is to construct positive experiences for yourself until they gain a momentum of their own, but that is much, much easier said than done.

my mom and dad abused me frequently and made me extremely insecure and permissive, you can imagine how well my dating prospects are when the opposite sex is either over the top extroverted slutty or absolutely nonverbal, non-cooperative as a standard
<comment>
By not being like the other men. For example, being good at an instrument (like guitar, or drums, or being good at singing) will instantly increase your value because most men are lazy normoids who play video games all day.

and assholes
Is anal really all that common outside of porn?
<comment>
it turns to worry
This is the most brutal line for me. I worry myself to death about weird shit. I find myself considering things that no one else with a normal functioning brain does. Example, when my friends asked me to meet them at a concert. I asked them if the arena has "slanted" parking spaces or straight ones. I hate and fear slanted parking spaces. But all my friends seemed confused by the question. I ended up not going anyway because I felt weird even asking them. I hate how weird and strange my mind is when it comes to thinking about shit.
<comment>
none of that matters when you're too ugly for women to get to know you. I have talents, but no women know about them because they refuse to talk to me.
<comment>
I see what you mean. I find that a lot of women are the over the top extroversion or the full on dead fish zombie like animal with no personality. I honestly dislike the idea of having a doormat for a wife. I really would like a partner in the truest since(50 / 50 ) but I don't know if such a thing is possible. I now understand why women probably don't want a doormat for a husband either.

I've talked just about every LTR I've been with into trying it at least once. Current GF likes it just as much if not more than PIV.
<comment>
How will any of this increase my height.
<comment>
yes, almost every girl has has done anal with chad, many of them even do ass to mouth which is disgusting. your future wife will have chads shit still on her lips.
<comment>
I was an incel for 32 years and the only thing that got me out was a hard cut to 10% bodyfat or so and plastic surgery. Women only care about looks and status and if you don't have status your only hope is to go all in on looks. 
You'll probably never be a Chad but you can at least compete with normalfags until Chad shows up.
<comment>
60% of young men (under 30) are incels. and that is the only period of life when being an incel matters, so it is extreme and important. simple as. causes permanent irreversible psychological damage to be alone at that stage in life.
<comment>
Thats whats brutal. You can't escape the damage. My confidence is definitely zero as I have had no positive relationship experience. However, I don't really let it absolutely get me down but I wish I had an avenue of attack to at least try and work towards relationships. My friend tells me I should ditch the online dating sites because they don't work for guys like me and just try opening my mouth in real life and talking to women. But trolling around for women just out and about seems weird to me. Do people really do cold approaching in a non-meme way?
<comment>
In your opinion, is it ever possible to escape inceldom?
depends entirely on your looks. for some the cliched advice of 'just get a good haircut, hit the gym, and take regular showers bro' actually applies to them. but those cases are few and far between and always involve someone who is tall and out of shape.
<comment>
Simple. You have to out simp them, dedicate your life to learning how to play an instrument just to get women. And then when those men out simp you in a decade or 2, invent a whole new instrument and dedicate even more of your life mastering it to get the remaining sliver of female attention. No man on earth has ever had to work this hard to get overweight entitled single mothers to notice them, good luck!
<comment>
Stop obsessing over it and focus on what you can actually change. No excuses nigga, I won't hear it. Get to work
<comment>
Yeah, sure you can cold approach women, just make sure you're hot enough and respectful to women or you know. Pic unrelated.

My honest advice: learn to own it. That's what friends are for. To understand you. I used to feel really autistic and bad at communicating and still do, but it's a lot more comfortable if you know that they understand and are willing to help you through it. Expose yourself to them more and they'll learn how to communicate with you. I pay attention to detail in very autistic ways and instead of that being something to be ashamed of it can be something that people value in you and ask you for advice based on it. It's all psychological, and once you break down the barriers it becomes so much better.

Turns out, people don't like shame-resistant autismos. You feel shame for a reason and your lack of it growing up is probably why you got bullied, and your friends probably won't appreciate it if you embarrass them in public too. Sorry, autists.

Escape inceldom by merely rejecting it. 
In all seriousness, I wonder how framing the term as a white cisheteropatriarchal lever of control would go. The term is most used as a pejorative by gynocrats. But I want to see how they react to me blaming their misdeeds on their enemies.
Junk like this, which I'd been exposed too long before the current year, is why I don't even feel I'm losing out that much. Women have been empowered to behave like feral beasts while simultaneously winning the oppression olympics by default --at least before the trannies arrived --while men are forced to turn the other cheek.
<comment>
Yeah. That makes sense. People want minimally emotive people else they begin to assume the worse, women especially. Reminds me of the BS shit tests you have to pass to get a job. They're testing not your ability to do the job but your susceptibility to social influence.

Listen here, scrote. As long as you respect women and support women's rights and their free and open access to abortion (the later the better) and only vote for females in leadership positions, there'll be no problems here, comprende?

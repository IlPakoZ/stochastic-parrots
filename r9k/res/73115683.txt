I got this for my IQ
Hopw do I do better and be smarter even thoughI got this score?

why do you want to be smart? its not a very useful skill to have.

You don't. That shit is genetic. Just be positive and good to the people around you and you'll get by just fine. Most people with higher iqs are suicidal and lonely because the way they think makes them extreme individuals.
You have the pleasure of getting along with the crowd. Go enjoy other people

You can make up for your lack of ability with excessive practice and positive attitude. People don't really care if your skilled, they mostly care how you make them feel. Make them feel good and practice alot alot. Muscle memory is real and repetition makes it stronger. Practice practice.

Pretty cool, I wish I could do something fun and adventurous like that. I have never even kissed a girl.

Nah she a woman I told her not to make noise if she sounds like a man

There's no such thing as "trans" women. It's a guy, and will always be biologically male. There's no removing the Y chromosome, and there's no vagina for you to stick your cock in.

Why does the Y chromosome decide what we should be called?

The Y chromosome decided you should have a penis.

You mean transman, i.e. a man transitioning to the feminine.

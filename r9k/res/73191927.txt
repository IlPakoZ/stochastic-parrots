Going to have sex with a trans woman tonight. Already booked a motel.
You're going to have sex with a fag dressed like a girl lok
Pretty cool, I wish I could do something fun and adventurous like that. I have never even kissed a girl.
Nah she a woman I told her not to make noise if she sounds like a man
There's no such thing as "trans" women. It's a guy, and will always be biologically male. There's no removing the Y chromosome, and there's no vagina for you to stick your cock in.
use to do this plenty of times when craigslist casual encounters was a thing. it was pretty fun. most of the time they were in dark rooms and dressed up so i didn't mind. got the best bjs from them
Going to commit sodomy with a gay man tonight. Already booked a motel.

I've failed my DMV written test twice now, im going to take it again on Thursday. Any advice to not fail, and also am i retarded for failing twice, everyone says the questions are common sense, but how many feet you need to stop or whatever the hell is not common sense
what kinda questions are you missing bro
usually ones that ask about weird shit, like i had no idea what ABS was last time i took it, or how old you have to be to ride in the back of a truck because id never done it and if i did id do it at whatever age i feel like doing it. Also anything involving an arbetrary number of feet, like how many feet you can travel on a turn lane, now i know its 200 but those tend to confuse me because im not good with numbers.
you should know what abs is but the other questions are dumb fosho
when i took my tests bake in like 2013 i just googled tennessee drivers license test and did tha tover and over until i got a 100% on like 5 diff sites
did you even study for the test? this should be fairly common knowledge in your area.
Sorry op, but suck to be a brainlet
Check your local Dmv's website there is probably a practice test you can take with the same type of questions
Literally just pass the test you faggot, pretty simple
Study more. Stop rushing. The more you fail the longer the wait time is going to be. I failed 3 times back when I was like 16 each of which was about 2-3 weeks apart. 
Give yourself time faggot.
Pray towards Mecca.

Pretty much wasted my freshmen year of college. Did absolutely nothing interesting or cool. I feel like an absolute fuck-up. I hope I'm less retarded next year and I actually get out and do shit. I really, really don't want to end up telling anons about how I fucked up my freshman year and giving them talks about how to not be like me in the future.

Trying to move out In the next two months whats the best way to find a cheap apartment in the city?
Airbnb for short-term stays. For cheapest try to find roommates. There are sites for that, but I can't remember off the top of my head.
Move to a crime ridden neighborhood and live in a building 50-100 years old.

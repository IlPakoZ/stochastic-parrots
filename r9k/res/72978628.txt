there's a reason people tend to be distrustful and wary of men.
There's a number of reasons
It's because they hate me and want me to be sad
Because man fuck your shit up. If women were physically strong then things would be different.
it's because you're sex obsessed monsters that jerk off to your underaged daughters, cum on them and let them stroke your cocks under the guise of sexual education :/
LMAO
Relaxing around a foid doesnt mean trusting them
i don't trust anyone but anyone with a brain knows that your average foid is leagues better than your average moid in terms of commonfolk morality, try shitter retard.
dumb cunt.
Who are these "people"? Not that I care about whether or not you diss men, I have a low view of humans in general.
Sorry that happened to you. I wish I could do that without it being traumatizing to the kid.
I'm sorry you feel this way but I am good and would make you feel you can trust men again.
most men are not compatible with civilized society. case in point
I agree that women are more peaceful, rational, and intelligent. But I think we still have a role to fulfil. I am good at my job in IT and get great joy from serving people, women in particular. They're always very nice to me you see.
women are not more peaceful rational or intelligent, they're just not as openly depraved or physically destructive as men.
But you can do nothing about it. i will sleep in my comfy bed and you can get raped by a pack of moids the moment you go outside.
how are you still breathing if men are that dangerous desu?

I'm the bad guy at home, I know this, it is my own fault. And my mothers, how can I help him? Moving out would be one thing, I will do that next year.

Lube your butthole, spread your asscheeks, lay on the couch Ass up face down, wait for him to come back from work. Enjoy

I don't find it helpful, funny though.

He's not kin. He's just the guy your whore mother is using to cheat on your father with. If he's super rich and gives you lots of money then I might could see wanting to play nice, but otherwise there's no reason to treat him any better than you would your poopjug.

my father left, not the other way around. I will not disparage him, but he could be better, and I could too.

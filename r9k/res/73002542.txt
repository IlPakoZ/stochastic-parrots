a lot of women can, but if they speak out they get harassed and forced into silence.
mtf trannies often threaten them with violence and various acts with their "girl cock"

It's the hip and popular thing, women's sense of "morality" is not determined by what is actually right or wrong, but merely what is popular and accepted by the masses. If we lived in an actual fascist state (I mean a real one, not one with some silly washed up reality TV star Twitter shitposter guy as president that gets shit on by television figures left and right) women would be the strongest supporters of it. 
Women do not know right and wrong, they only know popular and unpopular and will follow the herd wherever it leads them.

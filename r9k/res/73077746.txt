I got a summer job but don't want to do it
it's driving a van and selling berries
what job and why?
Selling berries sounds comfy. I got a job writing code on a shitty code base for some small company for a camera that barely works. My boss keeps overpromising the client and we are too understaffed and inexperienced to do it.
I want to sell berries

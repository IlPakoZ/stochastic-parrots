Is it unrealistic to expect a boyfriend to respect my abstinence-until-marriage? I don't have a boyfriend and won't anytime soon but if I eventually do, will it be even possible to expect this from the modern day man? I'm down with kissing, making out, cuddling and even slight sexual stuff like jerking him off but I really would like to keep penetration sex until marriage because I simply was grown up like that and can't shake off my religious mindset towards sex even in my adulthood. Also I'm just scared of having someone take my virginity who I'm not married to and then them leaving me. I don't want to be used like all the other stories of women I hear. And yeah I know that could happen with a husband but atleast they'd have to go through the divorce process which is a pain in the ass I heard. I'm ranting at this point but I'm sure there are many anons who say "i would definitely wouldn't mind" but Is it really realistic or possible idk. Either way I'm not having sex anytime soon. 
Mayb thats why I'm lonely I should just take the whorepill lol

Maybe the last thing you expected to hear on this website, but if you're religious then talk to God.
It's just the opinion from a random stranger, But frankly what makes the most sense Is about being abstinent until marriage is because The lifelong marriage comes from the soul, It's a higher love not originating in the animalistic bodies that we have. It comes from above, it won't last any other way. Appeal to the source of the truest love.
Besides the reproductive aspect, the function of sex seems to be maintaining the bond and Keeping the stress levels low. Dudes like having their dicks touched And it should probably be done often even if it's just a chore.
But the appeal of it fades and so you need to build your relationship On something other than it. I would ask God.

That's fine with me but we must fool around and you will suck my Hugh throbbing dripping cock and wear slutty clothes when I want you too
Even if we are not having full sex you better satisfy my heavy lust for you 
As I undress you with my eyes and fantasies about bending you over and fucking you raw (when married)

One problem you're going to run into is that most of the men who have saved themselves aren't very attractive. When you're an attractive man and women are all over you, it's difficult To withstand the temptation. It's easy for a man like me Because I only get looked at once in a Blue Moon And Women barely talk to me. Suits me because Women are a liability to a good man.
I can't imagine what it would be like to be an attractive man and have women everywhere. So your best bet for a man who will Discipline himself is probably not A man that you're attracted to. And I'm not saying to settle for A man you're not attracted to, I'm only saying That's an obstacle you will run into.

If I met you and we liked eachother, yes. Though in my religion there's no such thing as boyfriends or girlfriends, you enter into a marriage after getting to know one another and having the blessing of your father. I'm marriage minded. There can't be any sexual contact until marriage however so no jerking off, kissing or cuddling till marriage. To me God is more important than having a relationship, people especially women are unreliable and imperfect.

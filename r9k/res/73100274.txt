why wont you guys accept the fact women have harder lives than men?

A woman obsessed with proving women have harder lives than men, or a man obsessed with proving men have harder lives than women, is the equivalent of a kid saying "girls/boys have cooties." Gender warrioring is a sign of immaturity.

Women only have it tougher because they insist on going against the natural order of things. They want to do things that they are woefully unqualified for and get upset when they fail.

Is there even a point in competing in the dating market? For the majority of men it really seems like it's over.
just have a big dick i guess
the guy shouldve just adopted a cuck or humiliation fetish and use those vids to jerk off, wouldve been a win win for him
while there's a decent chance that's a larp from a cuck fetishist, having a gf that cares about you sounds good (plus sex once a day)
don't really get what's so bad here.
When it comes to marriage though it matters. One day the OP might get tired of having to tolerate her boyfriend and go cheat on him to fulfill her needs.

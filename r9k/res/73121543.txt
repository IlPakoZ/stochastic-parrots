i'm trying to break free of mine anon but it's hard. I remember i used to imagine being the guy getting the girl cause i have cucked a few different men in my lifetime but now i'm imagining being the cuck when i watch porn and have paid onlyfans whores money to sext with me and cuck me in fantasy. it's all been very sad and i'm trying to practice abstinence from all things cuckolding but sometimes i slip up. it's hard to watch a girl get exactly what she wants and then go back to anything else. the looks on their faces and the moans trigger something primal i think

Being an inadequate male actually brings me glee. I hate being male, so seeing that I'm failing at it brings me joy. 
At least that's why I used to have one, when I realized that was what I was doing, I was able to stop.

well it's best to look inside yourself and ask what about it turns you on?

He who has a cuck fetish has a chad fetish.
You want to be the cucker, but your subconscious knows you never be that so it places you in the position of cuck in the scenario.

All sexual fetishes are from some stupid childhood trauma. Figure out which part of your childhood was fucked up and you will figure out why you have a cuckold fetish

You like slutty woman and have an instinctive lean towards an r-selction breeding strategy.

tldr; "pump and dump" vs raising children.

It means several things
1) you are anxiously attached, meaning you have a deep-rooted fear of abandonment and (similar to how a bpd woman will self-sabotage) you desperately want your girl to cheat on you with your knowledge so that you can have some sort of control of your anxiety.
2)sexually submissive. This is straight forward. 
3) strong provider instincts. Your nature to be a provider is so strong that it has become sexualized that even if the child is not yours and she doesn't love you, you still get a rush of dopamine and sense if purpose. Also explains why guys buy onlyfans subscriptions.

woah, you must be walking pretty remotely. Do you live on a farm, or drive out of the city specific to walk?
it's 10pm, dark and I just got back from a run. Winter is just as good as summer for walk runs at night. -2 is my favourite. The normies aren't out, they're on suicide watch

The medium sized city i live in has a big forest on a hill right next to it that like to hike at night, kind of like a horror game while also enjoying nature.
Now that the sun starts to rise earlier it's also pretty to watch.
I really hate summer but love this stage where the weather is just perfect and not unbearably hot.

How do I get out and talk to people? How do I get the motivation to?
its over, you will never get that motivation at this point. stop lying to yourself and you'll be much happier.
Happy birthday anon :) original birthday
depressed 
Living in the past
anxious 
Living in the future 
Living in the present 
Stop taking things for what you think they are and start taking them for what they are
Society is fundamentally not designed for you, no one wants to talk to you and the NPC wagies have nothing interesting to say.
It's not your fault, enjoy life in solitude.
Getting a job at a grocery store helped me with my social skills and anxiety because I had to talk to people everyday. I don't recommend it but alcohol loosens the tongue and helps with anxiety even just a little bit but you just might be an alcoholic or become one. I bet if you played video games online and talked to people on there it would help. You have the game to talk about and any surface level bs is totally acceptable. Gamers don't really wanna have any deeper conversations mostly. What do you think?

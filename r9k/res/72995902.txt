There is something fundamentaly wrong with me and I don't know how to put it into words.

Describe your misgivings. You can't get along with others? You can't attain success in whatever fields? Name some specific wrongs, be as detailed as possible, perhaps r9k can help.

I'm just too different from others.
There is just something repulsive about me. Like an aura. I'm not the ugliest or most unhygenic or the most degenerate.
It's something else.

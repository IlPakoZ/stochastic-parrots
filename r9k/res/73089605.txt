Why arent you ghostmaxxing? Women love men who look like their dying.
i am. my neighbours call me the gray man because, well, my skin is very gray (here where i live it would be the same as being called a dead man)
do you get bitches friendo
my thread was more of a hypothesis then something i can prove lol
goth people (not only women) seem to be more interested in me than the rest from my experience
*they're
Now fuck off while I eat this burger and not give a fuck about what thots think.
goth girls are 10/10
I actively look like a decaying corpse. I have a nasty very light underdeveloped pedostache and Ive had the worst dark circles under my eyes ever since I was like 6 and the other kids used to tell me I look like a junkie before I even knew what that word meant. People are afraid of me and thats it
This sounds like total bullshit but I've gotten a lot more attention from women since I relapsed on opis and lost whatever remaining bodyfat I had left and now women tell me I have "Timothee Chamalet energy" but I'm actually just a dilapidated early-20's junkie.
How do I stop eating again? I used to be 140lb, living off of black coffee and what scraps I could take home from work late at night. After going back on antideps I gained ~50lb in the span of a few months.

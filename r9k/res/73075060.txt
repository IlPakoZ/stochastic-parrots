Be asocial
MFW people want me to "seek therapy" because enjoying loneliness is "wrong", and apparently you need to be addicted to social interaction.

you dont enjoy loneliness and enjoying your alone time doesn't make up for your lack of personality
grow up

Ignore this guy OP, he's part of the matrix. Normies start sweating as soon as someone shows the slightest resistance to their pro-social existential cope.

where did I say that being alone was bad and that he needs other people to be happy

Bless you and your comfy life. We are the ones that appreciate the little things. Normans who got sucked into the rat race wish they could have what we do.
They wanna bring you down because they're part of a system that disincentives real happiness AKA contentment

yfw the ICD-9 code now maps to schizoid personality disorder
yfw ~10 years ago they tried to make it a disorder again
yfw they're trying again right now

There was an interesting video I saw of some Russian guy explaining how the bible rarely, if ever, attributes laughter to "happiness". He said that most descriptions of happiness in the bible are of people whistling, singing or dancing in their own company. I wish I had the video. His overall point was that laughter has a malicious element to it and usually only emerges at the expense of another; schadenfreude. Whereas if you're comfortable enough to sing or whistle to yourself, you are probably a very happy or satisfied person. I wish I had the video. It was very interesting

You'll never find that video again. I just did a few searches, and it's so ridiculously obvious that all these tech companies are in cahoots to shove promoted content down your throat, stifling any discussion of religion that isn't aligned with globo-goals.

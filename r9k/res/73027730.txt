Hrt doesn't make mtf voices sound more like women (unless they start hrt while a child and in that case it would be more like preventing their voice from ever masculinizing to begin with).
The reason trannies who sound like women are able to sound that way is because they learn how to contort their voice with technique / practice.
Any guy, even with a deep masculine voice, could learn how to do a good female sounding voice if he wanted to as a way to make masturbating more fun or to get money from other guys on the internet.

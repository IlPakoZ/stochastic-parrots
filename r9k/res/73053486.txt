eerily silent thread today. hope you guys are having a fun or relaxing weekend, whatever you need right now.
Alles stressig hab aber meinen besten freund wieder gesehen und war wie frueher wollen oefters was machen
puuuh. und ich dachte schon, dass es mit deinem freund vielleicht nicht so geklappt hat und ich dich da in was reingeredet haette. fuehlt sich gut an, wenn man sich trifft und man einfach wieder da weitermacht, wo man aufgehoert hat, oder? hab mich wirklich fuer euch gefreut, als ich das gelesen hab. was war denn stressig?

How are you spending your Saturday?

lemmie bump real quick

I agree
it's a really fun game, but to this day i don't understand it as an ip or why it has become so insanely popular.
I kinda get it, it's easy to learn, everything is simple, and it can run on almost any computer
I first saw it in like 2010-11 when I was a kid, it was my first Introduction to games with a compleatly open world and it blew my mind
I couldn't believe that I could go anywhere and build almost anything 
as always...
hope you enjoyed it
they're talking about marvel fatigue.
I'm not surprised because even tho I don't pay attention to whatever marvel's doing there's been a time when you couldn't escape it, you'd get bombard with marvel related stuff right and left and it made me tired of hearing about marvel 
you're the best.
no u &lt;3 
btw sorry for not answering earlier, I got carried away building like a fort type thing

i think i heard that it also was one of the first games to show to people that they don't need to play mmos to get similar social interactions. what you mentioned is certainly true, but the community-aspect probably was a driving force as well. 
I first saw it in like 2010-11 when I was a kid, it was my first Introduction to games with a compleatly open world and it blew my mind
i try to remember what the open world experience was for me. gothic 1 and 2 were pretty seemless for the time. other than that, world of warcraft, i guess. 
hope you enjoyed it
i did. well, the store was pretty cramped because of yugioh-league and i didn't want to squeeze by everyone to get to the stuff i wanted to browse. was a bit miffed, but my friend got everything he wanted. so it's all good. 
there's been a time when you couldn't escape it
yeah. it was the thing you could watch with your friends when you didn't have anything better to do. it was ok 'til infinity war and fell off hard after. don't care about it anymore at all. i'd call myself a fan of superhero-media, but it's all so bad at this point there's no reason to bother with it anymore.
no u &lt;3
we're all pretty good, i'd say. 
btw sorry for not answering earlier, I got carried away building like a fort type thing
build myself a cathedral once. i get it. ^^ and don't worry. it took me an hour to reply to your earlier post. i really need to split up mine so people don't need to wait for so long...
hi, sludge. bye, sludge. sleep tight.
<comment>
the community-aspect probably was a driving force as well
probably, it didn't even come ro me because I've always been playing only on single 
Funny story, the first time I played it I accidentally hit the F8 button which makes the camera movement "floaty" and 
I didn't know how to fix it 
my brother was convinced I broke the game and got angry at me
i try to remember what the open world experience was for me
before Minecraft I've only played fps or flash browser games so it was a pretty big change for me 
we're all pretty good, i'd say.
yes yes, very true 
i really need to split up mine so people don't need to wait for so long
do as you wish but personality I don't think that's necessary
but whatever 
I'm glad you had an enjoyable day today, hope tomorrow's just as good if not better 
I'm going to sleep now
bye bye friend

Cutting yourself lol, I never understood why someone would attention whire in such a way 
"It's the only way I can feel! You don't understand me mommy, kw I'ma go listen to my music and cutt"
I consider myself a caring man,.empathic too, but the fact you all won't admit to yourself you just cutt for the attention ks sickening. You're degenerates

I'm going to sleep now bye bye friend
yeah. me too. good night.

somebody posted a picture of me here and everyone called me ugly, i look at the picture and i think i look good, and i have no real friends to ask if i am, so idk
Where's the pic?
inb4 I don't want to post it
Well, what was the fucking picture you god damn dingus? How are we supposed to know what the hell you're talking about?
it is still on the catalogk
Is that the one at the beach? You look good
it is the blonde hoe girl
you look kinda sad and depressed, but quite average otherwise
can't you link the thread? idk which one you're referring to
stupid lmao whoree
I'm sure guys of your own ethnicity think you're hot
you look fine, just sleep better to get rid of the bags, sit up straight, and try not to look so depressed.
You look aight. Maybe darken your eyebrows a bit so you don't look like one of those weird influencers who shaves them. I imagine it would bring out your eyes a bit more as well
oh. I don't like your nosejob.
Looks mixed race. Idk, not fat so that's automatically putting you above a five. Doesn't look like you're white though so stop pretending. It's not fooling anyone.
thanks i will try
why
mogs you dessyu
i am diagnosed autistic so i geniunly dont know how to emote in pics
I'm think you're cute but trying too hard to look good which makes you look a bit fake. I would definitely date you though
The makeup looks a bit off, and I really don't like the eyebrows. They look pretty chola imo (mexican gangster girls that draw in their eyebrows)
That being said I don't think you're ugly, though I've seen you look much prettier.
Thanks !haha I get it I still can't make out how to draw them correct
Smiling, genuine smile not a fake one, helps a lot. Just think about something funny to make you laugh if you have trouble with that.
Are you Roz? I've never talked to you directly but the plastic surgery was unnecessary. Have seen before pics too. Stop while you can, you're beautiful.
You look bogged and ugly
Stfu lamoo

<comment>

<comment>

<comment>
can't you link the thread? idk which one you're referring to
<comment>
stupid lmao whoree
<comment>
I'm sure guys of your own ethnicity think you're hot
<comment>
you look fine, just sleep better to get rid of the bags, sit up straight, and try not to look so depressed.
<comment>
You look aight. Maybe darken your eyebrows a bit so you don't look like one of those weird influencers who shaves them. I imagine it would bring out your eyes a bit more as well
<comment>
oh. I don't like your nosejob.
<comment>
Looks mixed race. Idk, not fat so that's automatically putting you above a five. Doesn't look like you're white though so stop pretending. It's not fooling anyone.

mogs you dessyu
<comment>
i am diagnosed autistic so i geniunly dont know how to emote in pics
<comment>
I'm think you're cute but trying too hard to look good which makes you look a bit fake. I would definitely date you though
<comment>
The makeup looks a bit off, and I really don't like the eyebrows. They look pretty chola imo (mexican gangster girls that draw in their eyebrows)
<comment>
That being said I don't think you're ugly, though I've seen you look much prettier.
<comment>
Thanks !haha I get it I still can't make out how to draw them correct
<comment>
Smiling, genuine smile not a fake one, helps a lot. Just think about something funny to make you laugh if you have trouble with that.

Are you Roz? I've never talked to you directly but the plastic surgery was unnecessary. Have seen before pics too. Stop while you can, you're beautiful.
<comment>

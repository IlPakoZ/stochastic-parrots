My outlook on dating and women has actually improved drastically ever since I changed my swiping behavior on dating apps. I no longer just swipe on everybody who isn't a landwhale. I actually reject 90% of women and only choose the ones I find to be exceptionally cute or who I can see a good opener with. As a result my interactions with women on there have been way more positive. I used to have women be dismissive, treat me as a dancing monkey, give dry responses, etc. Now most women I match with will give me a decent conversation. I still haven't gone on dates because I'm a carcel and I still have no gf because I can't talk to women in real life, but just doing this has greatly improved my mood and my outlook on life. Just thought I'd share for anyone who has had a lot of negative interactions with women on dating apps and had it greatly impact their mood.
im not reading all the copeshit. if women arent eager to be your fucktoys, you are a little bitch cuck simp retard for giving them time and attention.
Maybe it's just because of what I've been through in my life but the last thing I'd want to do is use a woman or anyone for sex.
its not using retard, its being a notsimp. i have a slave collar for you if you think otherwise, dumb simp slave bitch pussy.
I'm not a simp, I rather despise women who don't respect me.

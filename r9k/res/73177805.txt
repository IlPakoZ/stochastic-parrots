Yeah, nowadays guys are so demoralized they don't even try to go to clubs.
Maybe beta cucks like you, I been going ever since I got a fake ID in my teen years. There are plenty of real men in clubs anyway sweetie
I hate clubs because I don't like loud noise and I don't like to dance.
Ah yes, the "real man" who posts on /r9k/
same
but when i was younger i have been in a few scenarios to stand awkwardly and "flow" with the beat while a girl grinds on my dick

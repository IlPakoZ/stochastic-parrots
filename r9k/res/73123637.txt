Does society want me to work?
Yes, changing oil or tires.
Mcdonalds is always hiring
And that is why you are literally never ever going to make it.
Just make shit up.
I don't want to "make it". "Make it" to what? Being as "productive" as a chinese man? I'm good my dude.
Nobody already liked me when I was a hardworking student. I bet there are legions of NEETs with more friends than I and even maybe gfs.

I don't want to "make it". "Make it" to what? Being as "productive" as a chinese man? I'm good my dude.

I'm ""good"" (((my dude))).
also you:
waaah I'm so unpopular nobody likes me not even women

Nobody already liked me when I was a hardworking student. I bet there are legions of NEETs with more friends than I and even maybe gfs.

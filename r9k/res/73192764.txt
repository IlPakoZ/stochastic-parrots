Here I'll start 
Post your autistic thoughts
No replies? Really? So a well thought out greentext thread gets zero traffic but you guys automatically and fanatically reply to cuck and eacebait threads. Got it. My God this board has gone to absolute shit
shut up human, this board belongs to bots now
this is a well thought out greentext thread?
Theyd explode, total foid breakdown their frail emotions would be so overwhelmed that theyd all implode and break down crying
My autistic fantasies usually revolve around super structures I've thought up of. One that I've thought up of was a combination of a giant, 10km tower(not a solid tower, think of it as several segments stacked on top of one another) that acts as a giant cooling system, the contents of which are then funneled down to the power plant(s) below that uses the greater heat differential for a more efficient means of extracting work.
4chan's been acting up for me all day. I can't really use the catalogue or refresh without it being a coinflip(worse odds than that though) of it just not working. The auto update feature works somehow though.
Hey anon, I don't want to shit on your idea, but heat rises. Wouldn't it be more efficient to let the heat escape through the top of the tower?
Femanon here,
I'd masturbate too
well thought out greentext
lol
They'd probably get freaked out and bail at first, then wonder if there was some sort of tv prank going on once they see that everywhere they go it's the same. I'm more curious what the implications and coverup in the media would be over a force mass-fap event.
Compared to all the fucking bbc cuckposting, yes
i'm sure all those anons thought long and hard about those posts :)
That's exactly what you're doing (^:, hot gases rise up where they meet with a condenser that then compresses them(raises their heat but that's what you want as thermal radiation in terms of heat energy lost per unit time has absolute heat(heat above absolute zero) to the fourth power) and then streams it along radiators on the top. The design I had in my mind was reminiscent of a flower. Once the compressed gas reaches near ambient temperature up there it's then allowed to flow down, still compressed and reach the decompressor where the newly decompressed gas is extremely cool.
i had a period where id doodle plans of cathedrals made entirely out of domes, theyre domes stacked on top of even bigger domes and the inside are suported by arches and pillars, the outside would be decorated with colorful mosaics, theyd be many dome chambers connected to a main one by hallway made of arches, the whole structure is arranged at a cruciform pattern. So its basically 5 domes, a big one in the middle and 4 smaller ones arround it in each direction and every dome has one or two smaller domes on top.
That reminds me of some of the concepts with old cathedrals, I don't know the proper term for them though. I know gothic cathedrals made quite a lot of use of arches though(and arched domes inside) to support the weight of the whole cathedral. Many of them even had these towers on the outside with arches to provide added support to the walls. Also this makes me think of the Hagia Sophia, have you looked into its architecture before?
Thoughts on my first draft idea of a dream castle home? Drawn in 1 night of work
I pretend all my jobs I ever get are sidequests in a big mmo that I am grinding over and over
And when I have delivery jobs I like to pretend I am delivering stuff for the Resistance from Half Life or that I'm a CIA Agent deep in a enemy country and my packages have goods stashed in them to supply sleeper agents and stuff like that
Most of the things I do I pretend I'm doing other stuff like that like if I eat I am usually eating the last food in my bunker after the world ended years ago or I pretend I have my food because I live in a town that was able to wall off the zombies and get power and stuff working again or I am deep undercover in a destroyed house hiding from robot alien patrols and eating the rations the forward scouts stashed for me
lookes pretty neat,reminds me of how town halls look in european and latin american cities. id show you the model of the cathedral i drew but im bad at drawing and i cant find it.
yes, but honestly i like how orthodox churches look a lot more in the inside than the outside, gothic is peak SOVL but i do have a bias because i grew up in a place with lots of gothic architecture so it makes me nostalgic
does this make being a wagie less painful?
Almost all of these women were physically attracted to me at some point and a few of them even tried to awkwardly make passes at me. Once it was revealed that I'm a bit awkward and unsure of myself though, I basically became untouchable to them.
I'd like to a whole in the wall right next to their head and grab them with a strength they could never hope to match. 
I wonder if they'd still think I was a little bitch then.
I wonder if they'd still turn their nose up at me like I'm scum if I was holding one of them and forcing them into an embrace
Thank you anon, I appreciate it a lot! I drew it based off of French and Italian architecture. If you can find your cathedral drawing don't hesitate to show me please
Kinda I guess but I lost my job now and I usually only work for like 3 weeks at any job I get anyway before it gets to be to much and I have to quit or I get fired or something
I imagine the orthodox churches have lots of influence from Greek architecture which seemed to do just fine after the collapse of Western Rome, the gothic cathedrals seemed to be mostly piecing together a lot of what was still remaining from the best that I could tell. I really do love the gothic cathedrals, I even kind of 3D modelled one a little bit(didn't finish it though )^:). It was for a surreal game idea I had, it was gonna have stained glass and such too. I had some issues with the ideas I had as at the time I didn't know how I could implement stuff like volumetric lighting(to really make the stained glass feel real) and I also got hit with the crippling, depressing thoughts about how I'd be the only one working on every aspect of the game.
Are there any other architectural projects you've thought up?
the gothic cathedrals seemed to be mostly piecing together a lot of what was still remaining from the best that I could tell.
nope, byzantine churches are based off a late greco roman design, gothic churches are a much later medieval development, what you had in western europe after the fall of rome where romanesque churches which are much simpler than gothic, but still kino and SOVLFVL
I even kind of 3D modelled one a little bit(didn't finish it though )^:). It was for a surreal game idea I had, it was gonna have stained glass and such too
dounds kino af, can you post some pics if you still have them
nope, i just had that little bout of tism with the domes, otherwise i dont think ima particularly talented architect, allthough ik how to apreciate beautiful buildings and not gigantic arab tier flex sky glass dicks, how about you anon?
how come that happens to you anon? I got fired from my first job too after a month, but im pretty sure thats just because they where going broke
ill look for it soon anon, and i think you got the desing pretty well, have you thought about studying architercture in college, its difficult and not that rewarding but you might be good at it,
Never thought about it really, just a hobby of mine. I'm not all that good at drawing people but I love to draw up buildings
I do still have most of my 3D model. I remember I had more(and the whole idea in my head itself) but I don't have that copy anymore. I just have this earlier model I messed around with for ideas. It was going to be using the PSX style for rendering with some more modern touchups(that'd still have their resolution scaled down to keep with the aesthetic). It was also going to be very much like a dreamscape, on a floating, gloomy island. Fun fact, orbitoclasts(the tools used for lobotomies) have a structure kind of similar to a cross (^:.
I've had some other ideas about megastructures, but most of them I haven't gotten too in the weeds about fleshing out -- mostly overarching ideas. A lot of my ideas usually revolve around concepts, unfortunately.
I just get bulled and stuff by my coworkers or my managers and I have to leave before they start stealing from me or doing something worse then just words to me
And when I get fired it's always because I can't keep up with the impossible speed they want you to go or how crazy how everything they make you do is
Guess I'll do one I've had over the last few weeks.
Be me
Guess that's that eh? Honestly I was initially taken aback but now I don't give a fuck cause I'm Codymaxxing.
I'm gonna get into /fit/ not because I want bitches, but because I wanna be like him.

respect Cody for what he does and how he carries himself, how he grew from a Street Punk to eventually the Mayor of Metro City.
Guess that's that eh? Honestly I was initially taken aback but now I don't give a fuck cause I'm Codymaxxing.

Start thinking "Hey... Wouldn't it be funny if I just started acting more like him? Start becoming way more laid back, kinda a dick but ultimately good at heart? Hell, I already kinda..."
Guess that's that eh? Honestly I was initially taken aback but now I don't give a fuck cause I'm Codymaxxing.

Tower tops are very collapsible with so little structural support 
Otherwise it's fine

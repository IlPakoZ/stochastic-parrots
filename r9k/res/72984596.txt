Do we even have to mention the obvious guys? It is just so evident.
Anyways, here it go. You got pumped and dumped by chad, like 80% percent of women. Chad doesn't commit, he can fuck anyone and he does.

Enjoy being an alpha widow. Another to grow old and die alone because they think they deserve the guy who pump and dumped them. Oh well doesn't matter anymore.

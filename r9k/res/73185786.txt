I think i need therapy to process the fact that my gf was raped way before I met her
I just cant stop thinking about it and getting really sad and angry
isnt she the one supposed to be having trouble getting past it? stop being a retard and be there for her.
getting angry over tainted goods
yngmi with that kinda attitude find someone else or stay alone
I just keep imagining how scary it must have been and how much it ruined her life at the time which makes me feel a giant urge to stab the guy in the neck
Females live life on tutorial mode and the trade off is that they have a high likelihood of being raped, it's just life senpai. Also, remember that being raped as a female isn't really humiliating at all, they are the submissive gender after all. Just look at you, you're very upset that she was raped, but you're not repulsed by her like if she were a man. Why then is it so bad if it doesn't really change the way people look at her? Lastly, I think that most rapists aren't your typical predditor basedboy but a good looking chadlite, so there's that. sorry if this isn't helpful but I tried
i would be lying if i said it didnt repulse me slightly too
Reminder you will never make her have an orgasm like he did
Reminder she thinks back about the rape while having sex with you
When you get mogged by a rapist lol
She says it just hurt and made her avoid guys for a long time
What you expected? 
That she would say she loved It?
Saying she hated It is a cope mechanism
Why would she tell me about it at all then?

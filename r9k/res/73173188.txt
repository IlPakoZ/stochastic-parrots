I wish I was healthy and sexy and lived on a little farm in a mountains and my husband would chase me through the forest and then pin me down and have nature sex with me

Just get a hill and he'll have to chase you, you dozy bint.

But are your armpits good enough to smell? That's the million dollar question.

Humanity is kind of cursed if you think about it. We all fall under the black pill. Men and Women are just driven by unconscious programs and biology. Some have it easier and some have it harder but at the end of the day it's not healthy or correct to completely consciously intellectualise irrational things like love and sex.

What do you mean by this? You would deny that a Chad gets girls?

What do you mean by Chads and getting girls? Girls will dump a perfect tall blonde handsome guy if he cries in front of them. Yes, for casual sex looks are everything but it's more complicated when it comes to dating and relationships.

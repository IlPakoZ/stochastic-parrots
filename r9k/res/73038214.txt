homeschooled
completely missed out on everything
fucked up my ability to get scholarships so wasn't able to go to college 
now I'm 22 completely missed youth still feel like I'm 13 stuck in shithole hometown
zero friends never had a girlfriend only escape is suicide literally
You can still go to community college, get straight As, then transfer to a good school. Even if you aren't able to get a scholarship, two years of a 4 years college is half the expenses. Also 22 is far from it being over. I'm 25 now and wish I had known how 'not over' my life was at 22. It's only 'over' because you don't want to deal with the uncertainty, anxiety, and effort of trying and going into the unknown. It's just easier to convince yourself 'it's over' and give up.

I can't tell whether you think that's too big or too small.
In any case, having a small skull is a BAD thing and having a big skull is a GOOD thing.

its big for a skinny body, im built like the guy in op but with a long face.

My head also too big for my body.
But the problem isn't my head, it's my small frame.
If you have good proportions you can bulk up and look good, use steroids if you have to.

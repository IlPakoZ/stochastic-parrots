tfw no kinky bisexual stoner gf
I had one of those and she was awful
stoner gf
Used to be a massive pothead and can confirm that I never met a single stoner woman that actually had her life together. Not saying that it's impossible and that it doesn't also apply to men, but women can seemingly not be functional or successful while also smoking frequently.
I've had one too and I miss her. I want another one now
Eh, we can be unsuccessful together

Damn, im 30 yrs old
31 here. life after 
youth is dead, these are the years we wither in meaninglessness.
Time really do be slippin into the future
I used to make fun of the depressed 30+ faggots that still posted on 4chan and seemed to have nothing going for them in their lives and now I ended up turning into one of them
i have lots technically going for me in life but getting older is a brutal blackpill if you didn't find young love. simple as. all the rest i have, and its all comparatively meaningless. hard work, career, hobbies, education, money, creativity, etc. all mean nothing if you haven't started a loving family with your gf you've been with for a decade by 30.
While I do think young love is truly special experience that normies tend to take for granted, I feel like if I had literally anything else positive going on i'd be able to cope.
Like, if I was moderately wealthy, or atleast worked a fullfilling job I actually cared about I feel like kms and taking a bunch of ppl with me everyday.
This is a load of shit anon. Young love usually turns out to be a straight up disaster and is exactly why we have so many fatherless... children of various ethnic pursuasions.
Hi 30 years old, i'm dad
this is a massive cope. its like saying "driving sucks because people crash their cars"
yeah, and those that don't have the best transportation experience of all people. likewise, unless you're a retarded piece of shit, young love is the best kind. simple as.
This is depressing to hear at 24
Almost snagged myself a girlfriend but they moved to china and are asexual or damn near close to it.
Chick prior was a hopelessly porn-addicted hermit and really only wanted me for my dick.
Same. Also turned into a fat fuck, haven't weighed myself recently but it's at least 300lbs and I 100% blame it on my youthful metabolism dying. All I really want in life at this point is to thin out so I at least have a chance in hell at snagging a girlfriend before my 40s.

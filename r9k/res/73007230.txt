I was talking to this old haitan guy at work about tattoos and he tells me a story about why vaseline is the best for bite marks.
Mfw when he told me this shit
Ok. Did he use vaseline on your stinkstar or go dry?
this dude just casually told you he was a cheating piece of shit? I'm no saint myself but I would never admit to that to a co-worker
anon this was more than two decades ago AND he's black. cut the guy a little slack

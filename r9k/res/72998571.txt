God hates wizards and witches. There is no such thing as a good witch, they all burn in the lake of fire.

Before that, ancient Hebrews and Canaanites were full of mysticism and divination. The Talmud and Tanakh forbid all kinds of crazy shit because that's what they were doing prior to mono-theism.
Cloud reading, bone-talking (putting animal bones in your mouth to "talk" for the spirit of the animal), "Yiddie'oni" or ghost-talking, dream divination, casting lots (throwing bones/gems to predict the future). The whole point of the dreidel spinning is each of the sides has either Yes - No - Maybe -Try again Hebrew word on it, you ask it a question and spin it like it's a friggin magic 8-ball to see into the future.

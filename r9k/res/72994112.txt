When are women going to step up take over masculine gender roles from us?
Most of us failed at it and have been sissified by birth control pills in the water supply and xenoestrogen plastics or whatever.
Take responsibility, femanons.

i think deep down all men, not just incels, want a relationship like this, but dont want to admit it

I would very much prefer to be the dominant/masculine one in the relationship.

Anon, by now you should realise when feminists said they want a breakdown of traditional gender responsibilities, they meant only females would have less responsibilities

I know right. A bitch is better than a femoid any day of the week.

it was this realization that women wanted to keep men tied to their gender role (I arrived at it pretty quickly desu) that basically made me anti-feminist.

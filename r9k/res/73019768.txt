I'm going to be taking shrooms next week. I'm pretty young, should I be worried about anything?
<comment>
shrooms made me fucking insane. I never recovered to what I was before

Youll realize the darkness in everything, and be shook by edgy stuff you have observed, youll see most peoples actions are to cause others pain

What do you mean? I'm mainly just worried about causing permanent damage to my brain and fucking up my future.

do them alone, but also careful who with. Took the, with my mom and we ebded up fucking

I'm taking them with two other people. One is a guy friend while the other is a girl that likes me. There's a third guy too but he's going to be a trip sitter.

Dont do it if you're young. I experimented with psychedelics at 15yrs old and it permanently stunted my mental development. It's been 12years and I am still mentally stuck in the mindset of a teenager. You really ought to wait until you're older

I'm still in highschool but I'm taking college classes next year. I really don't want to stunt anything. Is there any amount I could safely take?

To be completely honest with you anon it isnt worth it. You might be fine but it's a very serious risk to effect you for the rest of your life. And Its not just me, many of the other people i knew who were doing mushrooms and acid back then are equally stunted. Most burned out and if you look at them it's like they're still mentally high schoolers despite more than a decade having passed. I'm at least self aware but it's still a huge handicap. I know it isnt what you want to hear, but it is the truth. It's really not worth the risk, give it a few years. Dont rob yourself of your future potential because you wanted to experiment too early.

If you know it's dangerous and you don't want to harm yourself, then why would you be taking it in the first place?

3 grams if you want to have a good time, 5 grams is the meme heavy dose for your first time
If youre a psychonaut do 10 first time, but if you want to enjoy yourself do 3

Yeah you're right. I'd like to but at the same time I don't want to make my life worse. I'll let the other people do it but I don't think I will. 
Thanks for the advice.

Wants to start drugs young 
One word op :
STOP.
reflect on your life thus far , abandon whatever melancholy drove you here in the first place and go live life in a healthy, working, normal and ideally sociable way while you're still so young smart and full of potential. Do it for your future self son.

should I be worried about anything?
Only if you have a predisposition to get psychosis, otherwise you'll be fine.
<comment>
Because I want to. I feel like it'd be fun. Also I don't really know the risks of it and that's why I asked.
<comment>
I only mean it as like a one time kind of thing. I'm super focused on school and as long as there are no permanent effects, I'd be willing to take them. If I'm hungover for like a week that's one thing, but if I never come back from it then I won't take them
<comment>
So I wouldn't fuck anything up beyond repair?
<comment>
No problem anon. You'll be glad you made the right choice. And be careful with this website, some people are malicious and will happily give you horrible advice

Yeah schizophrenia runs in my senpai. I took them for years and nothing happened. Actually my depression subsided

its about as dangerous as driving a car. sure, you can totally fuck up your life in an instant by doing some retarded shit, but 99.9% of the time its fine and the worst thing that happens is you get kinda scared.
poor demographic to ask though because most of the people here are utterly batshit mental and thats the kind of person who shouldnt be tripping

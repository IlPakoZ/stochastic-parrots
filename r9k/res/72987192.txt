I was talking to a girl about random stuff and we got onto the topic of what we find attractive, and she asked what I liked and didn't like, so I answered and the message was picrel words/characters long, and I even asked a question at the end to see what she thought about what I said. She responded with a couple wow emojis and that was it. That was yesterday.

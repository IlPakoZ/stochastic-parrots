does english make sense to native english speakers?

enjoyable things only exist because they were made by people who only exist because women had sex with people. if you enjoy things and you are not having sex with women you are a cuckold.

You don't learn languages by studying muh rules
sure, but learning the rules makes it a hell of a lot easier to pick up on and internalize the jibbajabba once you r dropped in a native environment

'ache' having a hard K sound
'shown' not sounding like 'town', down', 'crown', etc
some words having a consonant added with the suffix -ed; 'controlled', planned'
other words no; 'failed', 'boarded'
weirdly spelt words like 'night', 'wednesday'
There's so many oddities like these that can only be mastered through just remembering what's correct and what isn't.

Don't you just feel like life is one big joke and you're the punchline?
Yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm Truman and everyone is laughing at my misery. It feels like people on the internet are also just actors.
I try to improve things at work and my manager just creates problems out of thin air every other day. It's absurd.
that's just a life of a slave, you should have known what you were getting into
I will admit that it's shitty, but it's too late to get out of it now. Dropped out of college. One job before this. I had little choice and made the best of my bad options.
The longer I live; the funnier I get.
yeah it feels like i'm one of the few who see how retarded TV, social media and socialization has become. how shit all of human history is. how similar we still are to chimps.
feels like i'm one of the few sane people left but thats what all loons say.

It's wrong to beat women.
<comment>
The three laws of being a man:
A man may not injure a woman or, through inaction, allow a woman to come to harm.
A man must obey the orders given him by women except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
A man must protect his own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

But what if she did something really bad and totally deserves it.
Women can be evil too.

True.
You shouldn't beat anyone unless they have been bad.

Beating women is like beating manlets. It's 100% ok to do it and probably actually a net good for society but you should never brag about it desu.

It's wrong to beat women.
If a woman legitimately puts me in a situation where I have to defend my life, she's getting clocked. FULL STOP.
<comment>
I honestly don't think about hitting women at all
<comment>
I will, but it won't be in the kinky sort of way. If left to my own devices, I would bash your face into concrete until there was nothing left.

Not at chess.

People say this, but women pretty much never start physical altercations with men. It's always the opposite.
<comment>
The rationale for "never hit a woman" literally doesn't make sense. They say it's because men are bigger and stronger than women, and yet:
Some women are stronger than some men
In many conservative areas, where "never hit a woman" sentiment is the strongest, it's OK to beat unruly schoolkids
Nobody ever tells teenage boys "never hit a younger boy" or "never hit a cripple."
It's literally just female supremacy masquerading as fairness. They claim it's about "strength" but when you look at all these other situations where it's OK to hit someone weaker, it doesn't add up. It's more more of a "slave isn't allowed to talk back to his master" kind of thing.

Women are such pathetic submissives they secretly are hoping to get beaten up by you. This is how you will ascend anon. Godspeed anon

Many studies show that the majority of domestic violence is initiated by women.

Are you the same person I replied to who said "women don't start shit?" If so you're backpedalling hardcore here. This is the behavior of someone who has an extreme bias and will just find excuses to continue thinking the way they've always thought when proven wrong.
<comment>
this is true! i never say it, but i crave to be abused. it shows just how masculine you are, asserting your dominance by hitting me.

Well, let me tell you where I'm coming from. I've started a few of these threads critiquing "never hit a woman" sentiment. I, personally, have never hit a woman, and I hope that I never have to. But the idea that women are categorically never physically dangerous to men is just false. An old girl can be dangerous to a young boy, a group of women can be a danger to a lone man, etc. Picrel is an example of unarmed girls managing to kill a man. How? There were eight of them, one of him. I'd reckon this dude would have been justified throwing punches.

If you find men getting beaten up by women just funny because men are subhumans unworthy of empathy or whatever, I will point out that another one of these groups of girls, in the same city, also assaulted a female victim. And yes one of them was a girl.
Girl running around slashing old women in the face? Yeah, she DESERVES A BEATING from a STRONG MAN.

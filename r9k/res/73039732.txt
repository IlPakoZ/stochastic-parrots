Can I merge my inner child's personality into my current one and become whole?
if you wanna be friendzoned
If only you were korean you wouldnt have to do this
No, your inner child has his own inner child that you'd need to merge with next, and so on into infinity. It's inner children all the way down, or so I hear.
Not without also integrating the shadow

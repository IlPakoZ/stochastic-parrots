I'm sure you could find one with some effort, you'd think most trans women are into males, but there's also a lot of them who are into girls.

NTA but you'd think that and seemingly you'd be wrong. Transbians are grossly common from what I've seen. Transbians tend to look pretty horrid though.

Yeah they are extremely common, most of the trans friends i have are into women, either that or they date other trans women, it's so surprising.

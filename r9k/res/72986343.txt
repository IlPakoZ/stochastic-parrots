I went to the hotel I used to work at to meet some friend who still works there when suddently some qt appeared there, I did a bit of small talk with her but she seemed uninterested so I didn't push it
Then, some good looking guy went to play the piano in the common area and she ended up giving him her number and talking to him on the sofa
I'm an average looking guy (maybe ugly? the situation made me doubt that) it happened two days ago and I still think about it
Remind yourself that most people are cunts and arnt worth caring about she probably had loads of flaws that make her a pain to be around, fuck 'em all.
You can't get rejected if you don't talk to women in the first place.

Finished my exams today and now i'm drunk alone in my room in the dark. Might watch a Wong Kar Wai movie, maybe that gay one called Happy Together, or another movie entirely - Buffalo 66. I've never felt love though so I don't see what's the point in watching romance movies. I've felt what it's like to be drunk though and I wish I could be it forever.

I love watching those melancholic romance kinos. Enjoy your evening, anon

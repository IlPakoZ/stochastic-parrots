You will never be a real slug. I know the idea of gliding effortlessly, leaving a slimy trail behind, and having no worries may seem appealing to you. But the harsh reality is that no matter how much you try, you will never truly be a slug. Sure, you can cover yourself in slime, crawl on the ground, and munch on leaves, but that won't change the fact that you are a human being. You possess hands, feet, and a complex brain. Slugs don't have any of that; they are just a squishy mass of flesh that slithers around.

I became addicted to furry and gay porn at 10. realized god would probably banish me to hell so I stopped believing in him
<comment>
old enough to see christfagging become the counter-culture
lmao
<comment>
But this is only one part of the story...
I also realized that outside of /pol/ there are no 'based' christians. Even my conservative family who are against homosexuality and feminism don't talk about how they want to burn faggot or hang heretics, I was the one doing that but then realized that I was the odd one out. No normal grass-touching christians talk about universal love and turning your cheeks.

Fuck I should really proof read lol

I was raised atheist. When I got older I got interested in religious studies and after reading about all of them, I decided the Jews were right. I also learned that Jews don't require that you convert in order to be 'saved' so I didn't convert. So now I'm a gentile who tells people he's non-religious while believing in the Jewish God and following Jewish morality.

If you kept reading to the stories of the prophets and the Judges, even God Himself got sick of the kikes and their constant backstabbing and basically abandoned them. That was the entire point of the work of Christ
fulfill the Messianic prophecy
reform the shit out of Judaism and do away with their retarded, hypocritical, barbaric laws (other than the commandments)
give the religion to the Gentiles since the Jews are fucking backstabbing kikes
redeem the world from sin
You need to delve deeper before you dismiss it outright. Also, actual religious Jews who aren't finance moguls and Muslims who aren't durka durka boom boom people are pretty based and their philosophy is worth reading, too.

I never was a Christian. My first religious experiences were from looking into occult philosophies which ACTUALLY make sense, unlike The Bibble.

I'm really interested in Christian morality. Like did every culture have a similar morality system or was it different. I'm not a scholar but if you read the bible it says not to do things because it is impure and therefore not to do it ever! But I suggest an alternative, that it's not inherently bad to do anything in moderation. We see that the highest porn consumers are actually Christian states. Maybe saying all porn is evil and bad isn't a good thing. Don't be a coomer of course but I realized the less I cared about how 'evil' porn is the less I actually consumed it.
Yeah lol
I still remember I wasn't allowed to watch Harry Potter or play Pokemon and they're the ones who say they're cool now!?!?

I dunno anon, Jesus was LITERALLY INRI, the King of the Jews.
<comment>
Why does God punishing me?
<comment>
They hate certain members of differenr tribes. If you look closely at their history, you will find exactly which ones they hate. I would not be surprised if they have a vendetta against the ones they stereotype and hate more than the others. I fucking hate this division we spread,its fucking retarded.
<comment>
Very powerful forces, be careful with being retarded.
<comment>
NOOOOOOOOO GOD SHOULD'VE INCARNATED AS A BLONDE BLUE EYED ARYAN TO REFORM THE JEWISH RELIGION THAT WOULD'VE BEEN SO HECKIN' BASED AND REDPILLEDERINO
Why are teenage atheists so fucking retarded and conceited?

Hi, brother. I will be quiet then sonlon as you leave me alone :^)

We are created in God's image
That means God must be human
I can't wait until Muslims kill all Christians.
<comment>
The Pharisees (the people Jesus constantly shits on, and who eventually conspire to have him killed) were basically the embodiment of everything wrong with Judaism. They were spiteful, backstabbing hypocrites and elitists, and God had literally abandoned them at this point and allowed them to be conquered several times over for their failures. Jesus's teachings offered redemption to the Jews, but since they'd been such massive fuckups in the past and continually rejected his teachings, he opened the door to Gentiles too.
<comment>
Huh?
No I don't really believe in anything. Honestly do we even need religion? Napolean was one of the most revered heros in history and he was an atheist with an atheistic ideology. Honestly it tends be be religious people who aren't nationalists.
<comment>
Actual religious Muslims are very based and I have no quarrel with them. Same goes for (most) religious Jews.
t. Catholic

I realized it's nonsense that can be used to justify literally anything as well as its opposite.
<comment>
No surprising, you're all narcissistic scum who shit all over the infinite majesty of God with your retarded bullshit.
You all worship Jewish idols and claim to understand what God thinks and wants. 
You'll get what's coming to you. kek

it's pretty much just the Israelite cope for their God being weak in a Middle Eastern context
he doesn't lose! we just failed him so he left!

ok so we were always the second choice?
ok so I was going to give all of my inheritance to my backstabbing elitist son who I always preferred and looked after for thousands of years, but now you my step son who I ignored for millennia and would've probably continued to ignore will get my inheritance
Umm thanks?
Also Paul changed Christianity to be more gentile-friendly and he was the one to get rid of Jewish customs like circumcision.

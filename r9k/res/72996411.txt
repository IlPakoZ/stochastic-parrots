Will he become an e-celeb boxer now that's he's out of jail?
He should box Idubbbz or Andy Warski.
That would be the sign for the beginning of the merge.
Chris vs Sam Hyde?
I think Sam would actually kill Chris.
Chris should fight idubbz or someone equally weak like CM Punk
Chris vs Dr Liquid Chris.
But if Idubbbz loses again, he will cry fr fr this time
Ian Jomha needs a W, okay.
Chris-chan would go full-retard and KO Ian, he would kill himself
how does chris still exist didn't they shut down kiwifarms already

Money can't buy you happiness. It can only give you the foundation to support happiness. 
I could live in a million dollar home. What good is it without having someone to share it with? What good is it if my partner is only in it for the stability?
No amount of material things will make me happy. I keep climbing the ladder at work. I'm the most stable I've ever been. I'm happy with my life at work. But my personal life is extremely boring and lonely. Everyone I meet seems superficial and fake in the dating scene. It's like they look at the things you have and not the person that you are. Homeless people who have a spouse are happier than any of us, because they exist as a unit for each other. They have someone they can lean on no matter what. A best friend, a companion. 
I can only lean on myself and everything that I do is for myself. Every day I do my hygiene and go to work and put 110 percent effort in. My coworkers appreciate me for doing this. Upper management appreciates me for doing this. But I do ask myself all the time, "What am I doing this for?"
I've been telling myself that I do it to provide a foundation for the person that I might one day meet and fall in love with. I want to buy a house and share it with the person that I love. I want to spend my time with them until I grow into old age. I want to have someone that I wake up every day and think, "I'm going to work hard today, for them."
What do you think? Am I insane? I just kind of want to get this out there. Went through a really bad "break up" a few days ago with someone who I thought was on the same page but isn't ready for a commitment yet (understandable. I wouldn't want to compromise either.)

It's admirable that you try this hard anon, I respect you for that. I could not find it in me to do that, I do the barest minimum at a job I don't enjoy that pays pretty well. Not well enough to ever own a home, but I don't see the point in trying anyway, I wanted to escape the post-communist shithole I live in, but I'm so maladapted to life that I can't even secure a job I want to do or friends or gf.

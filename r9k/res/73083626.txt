Do you have friends? I've been friendless for 5 years. I don't really go outside except to work.
<comment>
Only online friends.
<comment>
i haven't had a proper offline friend in years.
<comment>
I haven't had irl friends in 8 years and no online friends for 5 years. I want to become more normie, but I feel like I'm too far gone. In some ways I feel like I've seen too much of how the sausage gets made and it makes me not want to interact with people, but maybe that's cope for how fucked up I am.
<comment>
Offline? No friends for 10 years now. No close friends for 17 years. I'm 28.

How do we make friends, bros? It is also detrimental to the pursuit of the gf.
<comment>
you need friends more than you need a gf so you should focus on that.

best bet is probably going to school, desu.

best bet is probably going to school
I already finished my undergraduate degree. Will be returning to academia for a masters in 2-3 years though.
<comment>
by school i mean uni or taking some sort of course.
<comment>
what did you study? oregano
<comment>
Biomedical science. I'm a STEMfag to the bone.
<comment>
I just got here recently and picrel is why I know I'm home now
<comment>
I dont have or want friends, even online ones, and if you do you are a normalfag
<comment>
and you didn't pursue medical school? what are you getting a masters for?
<comment>
you didn't pursue medical school?
No. Could've got in since my graduating GPA was 3.98, but I didn't want to swallow a tremendous amount of debt just to become a suicide risk for the next 8+ years while competing against pajeets/Asians with far more passion than me. Doctors should be people who actually care and have strong mental. That's not me.
what are you getting a masters for?
Pathologists' Assistant.

Pathologists' Assistant.
didn't want to become a physicians assistant? is it because you don't like being around people?
<comment>
I haven't really had friends that I'd see regularly since like 2009-10, even then those relationships were strained for a few years before really falling off altogether
My only real friend that I still hangout with is the dog
<comment>
no, i really dont like people
<comment>
is it because you don't like being around people?
Bingo. I'm not a misanthrope, but I don't belong in a role with frequent patient interaction.
I miss my cat; she's living with my parents.

I think a lot of friendships fall apart during teen years largely because your friends are getting GFs and you're still single and your friendships start dropping off because you start to feel like a third wheel and it's frustrating
I think you need both friends and GFs at that stage in your life in order to move forward with healthy relationships, it's a 50/50 balance needing the GF in order to not feel frustrated while your friends are with their GFs
<comment>
in my 20s I lost 3 cats and 2 dogs that were with our family during my childhood/teens. Besides losing all your friends, having to watch all your animal friends drop off 1 by 1 thanks to oldage/sickness is all just an extra kick in the feels

i disagree with this as my friends are engaged and soon getting married. i think the drop off happens only when kids get involved which is reasonable.
<comment>
No and I am okay with that. I get enough socialization at work. I like my alone time a lot.
<comment>
that's where the 50/50 balance comes in - If you're going to be isolated from your friends due to them having family and whatnot, it just makes more sense to get a serious girlfriend / potential future wife at that point so you can be friends with them instead
<comment>
I used to. i lost them all due to isolating out of a sense of shame over a period of a decade, beginning in college. I no longer felt I could relate to any of them as most of them slowly got married, got houses (easier on dual income for them), and had kids. Meanwhile I hadn't even held a woman's hand by comparison. There was no longer any shared experiences in our lives. I felt like the odd man out, as most people started showing up as couples to things. I felt an atmosphere of awkwardness and didn't want people to feel a sense of pity toward me. I felt ashamed over my limited progress in life. I slowly stopped receiving invitations to things. Partly it was people getting busier with their own lives. Partly it was people mistaking my aloofness/withdrawing for me wanting nothing to do with them. That's not what I intended. Mostly it was me not wanting to embarrass myself or make things awkward for other people by being around them or making them feel pity.
I was also ashamed of my finances/career for a while in my twenties, even though I had a decent job. Started in college when I nearly failed out after not going to class other than exams for 3+ years. When I switched jobs a lot and finally found one that would be considered respectable (engineer/space stuff), I still found it wholly unfulfilling. Felt an overall sense of impostor syndrome despite my job being a glorified spreadsheet/database monkey or button pusher. My only social life is in my career now. Haven't done anything social in 5+ years other than awkward weddings. No longer meet new people. Never leave my house other than work/gym.

do you at least play an instrument or something at home?

It's not as fun if you don't have people (a GF or wife/kids) to share your successes with.
That situation sounds financially stable enough that you could actually attract a partner though. I'd argue that a majority of single guys are TFWnoGF because they're either NEET or just scraping by doing some McWagies job

not particularly. never could force myself to learn piano, though I play a lot stuff by ear. stuck in my mind transposing treble cleff to bass cleff, due to my experience with it. never took an interest in guitar, as near everyone can play a little bit.
played trombone for around 20 years, but i never touch it anymore. never thought myself very good. played in festivals/stuff in high school/college at random places. lost all my embouchure regardless. haven't touched it in around 7 years now. too loud to play, and a practice mute ruins the sound.
<comment>
so what do you? just browse this place and jerk off at home mostly?
<comment>
basically. add in excessive sleeping on days off. add in excessive overtime due to having nothing better to do - work like 60+ hours/wk. add in failed attempts to play vidya like I used to enjoy due to getting older and anhedonia.

Eren Yeager is so cool!

I have one friend, my boyfriend. Otherwise I only speak to my mom and see my other family at holidays. This is how I prefer to live. Other women treat me like crap and all men except my bf are dogs.
<comment>
Hmm I dunno he kind of smells like a baka
<comment>
Offline? no. 
Online? no. 
I cut off everyone I knew because I thought I would've killed myself by now.
<comment>
He's not a baka baka

I actually like BPD girls you are actually less narcissistic and fundamentally sweeter than normie women other than your episodes. You also actually try to make amends and take responsibility for your bad behavior during your angry blacksplitting episodes. I hope you get better...

I hope you get better
that's not how that works

Hear is my advice, the men in your life know you're emotionally unstable there is a period between when you are going to split them black... give them a warning and tell them to call in a couple weeks or something after the weird anger thing passes. BPD girls are WAY cooler than normie women in their good periods so they'll be understanding. You're also good at making up for your bad behavior...

Therapists are normally scams but I've seen a BPD girl actually respond well to headshrinkers and therapy. She wasn't emotionally stable but there were no insane rages at people close to her. And as far as burning your bridges that is the only thing people really don't like about your girls... otherwise you're quite charming and ussually hilariously funny in a way normie women never are.

Really in summary the only thing you need to do is manage your periods of sudden intense rage at people in your life... otherwise everyone around you adores you because you project intense fun and positive energy in your good periods in a way nobody else can. If you can manage that very few people will desert you...

It will never go away
Like 90% of BPD people recover from it in a few years with help.

They learn to manage symptoms, there's a difference. 
I've been dating a bipolar girl for years and trust me, there are flare-ups. It's excruciating.

Bipolar
That is an entirely different illness moron. We're talking about borderline personality disorder.

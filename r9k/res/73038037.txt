The vast majority of gun violence in this country isn't committed by "incels" or "basement dwellers". Even when you take into account per capita and aggravating circumstances. Why do normies put their hands over their ears and start screaming uncontrollably when you explain to them that their stereotypes are bullshit?
Because most normies don't know a gangbanger or nigger, but they do know a local chudjak.png, class republican, or military """historian""" that looks a bit like the last faggot that just did a mass shooting. Basically feelings don't care about your facts, and if you say otherwise, then you're defending mass shooters or are gonna go postal yourself, so they will attack you. 
I don't make the rules. I don't even enforce them. I just tell it how it is.
Normies pay attention to/get mad at what people of higher status and the media tells them to pay attention to and get mad at. Many normies don't even have an internal monologue and/or can't imagine anything.
No one believes incels commit a large fraction, let alone the majority, of gun crimes, incel

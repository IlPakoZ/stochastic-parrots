My pillow is old as shit. All kinds of stains and it's practically more of a sheet with how much it's been flattened over the years. But I can't bring myself to consider a new one. The stains are all sweat and whatever else goes in my hair and on my face before sleep, so it's not like I'm dry humping it into submission or anything. It just smells nice. Maybe not nice, but it smells like dreams I've had. It smells like a lot of nightmares, but the more years go by the more I start to enjoy those nightmares, especially the recurring ones. I like my dreams anymore. I have a lot of fun in there. 
Basically, I don't wan to get rid of my pillow, but I'm also wondering if there's a point where the nastiness on it will kill me.
Anyone else got a complicated relationship with a pillow that doesn't involve fucking the feathers out of it?

Why don't you just get another pillow for physical comfort and keep the old one for emotional comfort?

Not with my pillow per se, but my whole bed. It's just a hand me down from my older brothers that I got at like 6 and have just held on to through my whole life. It's a little nasty. It's got stains too, and I'm sure it smells like 4chan boy, and it's definitely not the most comfortable, but it's mine and always has been. I don't feel the need to replace it.
You should clean your pillow anon, or get an easily cleanable sheet for it or something. The smell won't go really go away at this point, and you'll keep adding more to it anyways. Hygiene's important. For me personally the feeling of clean bedsheets is a very simple pleasure, and by the end of the week it'll all be back to how it usually is anyways yknow?

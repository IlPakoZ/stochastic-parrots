Since 6 weeks or so 4chan doesn't let me make threads. That feels bad. I think it was not me, because it's a range ban. Or they did it because I was talking about being sick from the vakseen. Getting cangeled even here is the full demoralization. And blocking people from communication without even telling them why is a disgrace. 4chan could be a hero in this times of cancel culture, but it's not.

Have you tried Twitter? Elon is basically courting bootlickers and Fox News watchers. Good luck.

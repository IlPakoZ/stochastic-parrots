has anyone here ever boogiemaxxed?
I was being boogiemaxxing some years ago. Being the most agressive and remorseless pos gorging on tons of food till I almost become morbidly obese. Nothing much have changed since then except I lost a shitton of weight and became less of a cunt. Thanks for reading my blogpost.
I lost a shitton of weight 
nice job. what was the straw that broke the camels back in regards to you starting that weight loss journey. Congratulations
Dubs and boogie rapes every fembot with his monster cock and NTRs every robot
Thanks man. I have been a NEET for quite a while and had nothing better to do back then either so I started a "self improvement" which I swear was not to get women but just to see how far I could get.Basically nothing changed in my life except I atleast not feel like fta fuck for the most part. My weight didn't actually bother me to the point of concern though it definitely should have.
is he fighting wings or not?
Boogie was the quintessential "nice guy".

yes, started taking dance classes in urban culture and salsa. boogiemaxxing is my thing. 
oh do you mean, am I eating like a glutton and cheating on my girlfriend maxxing? being a nice guy crybaby, even though he's actually a massive asshole. and even makes me, some unimportant dude, cringe at his existence, getting to be such a fat fuck.

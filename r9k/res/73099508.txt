has anyone here ever boogiemaxxed?

I was being boogiemaxxing some years ago. Being the most agressive and remorseless pos gorging on tons of food till I almost become morbidly obese. Nothing much have changed since then except I lost a shitton of weight and became less of a cunt. Thanks for reading my blogpost.

Thanks man. I have been a NEET for quite a while and had nothing better to do back then either so I started a "self improvement" which I swear was not to get women but just to see how far I could get.Basically nothing changed in my life except I atleast not feel like fta fuck for the most part. My weight didn't actually bother me to the point of concern though it definitely should have.

yes, started taking dance classes in urban culture and salsa. boogiemaxxing is my thing. 
oh do you mean, am I eating like a glutton and cheating on my girlfriend maxxing? being a nice guy crybaby, even though he's actually a massive asshole. and even makes me, some unimportant dude, cringe at his existence, getting to be such a fat fuck.

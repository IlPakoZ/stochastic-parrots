If you spent the time complaining about having no gf going out and meeting people, you would have a gf by now.
if i went out and tried to meet people i would have had the shit beaten out of me or been arrested by now for doing some critical mass of autistic shit
i'm certainly not high-functioning (ordinary office job, normal iq) but i'm not a neetbux level retard. and that is pure agony because i can see what i'm missing out on. my complete inability to make friends or acquaintances or make people like me is so cripplingly painful i want to die every day. i don't even care about pussy much at this point, i just want friends and to feel vaguely comfortable with people. i'm too depressed about it to even keep up with my autistic obsessions, i honestly keep imagining a horde of normies going "haha gay". i wish i was a true retard, no responsibilities or desire to escape his own little world and not even knowing what he's missing
I am mentally ill, women can sense it. I've gone out and met people. I have nothing in common with girls.

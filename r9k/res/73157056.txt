I'm leaning toward thinking they're probably NOT worth it, mainly because if you explicitly state that a website/forum is about dating, you attract a horde of men and get a bad M/F ratio. However, because Discord is social, it does tend to be better for meeting new people than dating apps are. What do you think? Should I give it a shot?
didn't read + the left CANNOT meme. KEK!
no women don't use discord 
the only women that do are mentally ill and looking to fuck you or girls with boyfriends.
I actually met this really wonderful woman on a gta 5 server and we've been talking for well over a year now, we are going to be meeting up in the summer soon.
Meeting people through online communities is generally legit AF. Meetup.com is the best, Facebook and Insta close runner ups. I'm just a little uncertain about Discord because it seems like a sausage fest.
Not really.
Its just grindr but on discord.
There are 0 women there.

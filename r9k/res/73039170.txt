casual reminder that you should thank god for making you a lifelong virgin who never experiences love and intimate romance
thank your kind, endlessly merciful and benevolent god
in his endless mercy he makes sure you are a laughing stock for all the sex having normies who browse here for the laughs
but Jesus himself never had a girlfriend and died a virgin
clearly it's nothing to be ashamed of. we're emulating Jesus way better than some hypersexual normalfag
how can you believe in revelatory religions? you have to be delusional to believe in a resurection, or some guy 2000 years ago turning water into wine
its clearly schizofrenic shitposts or deceptive lies. those things cannot happen, and its not justified to believe those things
you can reasonably believe in god, but not your supernatural religious stories

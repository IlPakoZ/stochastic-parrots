I'm a white woman with a jewish father and a catholic mother and my ideal man is half jewish and half asian (preferably korean or brahmin chinese). does this make sense and if so what is the political explanation for it?

There is no political explanation. Jews are evil and this is common knowledge world wide

I think I takled to you before, have you talked to many anons on 4chan. My analysis is that there is no political explanation, you just want a man you can have power over who you feel is powerful in his own right

I'm a white woman with a jewish father and a catholic mother and my ideal man is half jewish and half asian (preferably korean or brahmin chinese). does this make sense and if so what is the political explanation for it?
I dont know and i dont care
There is no political explanation. Jews are evil and this is common knowledge world wide
You went to eat Chinese food on Christmas day, like all Jews do, and you fell in love with your waiter.
Add me on the cord and we'll see if i am your type. I am not asian but I can probably explain it . I have israle and Latino DNA but I am a practicing christian
Actually you know wat, I don't really like jews so dont add me.
I think I takled to you before, have you talked to many anons on 4chan. My analysis is that there is no political explanation, you just want a man you can have power over who you feel is powerful in his own right

dear men, 
i only avoid eye contact with you in public because im shy. it doesnt mean im repulsed by you, i actually find it flattering to be smiled at, i dont smile back because my teeth are bad. please dont give up i promise we're not all evil.

Don't worry I do the same thing, if we ever meet on the street just remember we're both respectfully not looking at each other.

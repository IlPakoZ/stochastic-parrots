Why does every single "gamer" girl only play Valorant and League?
I started off playing dota 2 and csgo because my older bro told me to get steam and he was already playing both of them. Ended up switching to league after 1200 hours on dota. Dont really like valorant, im excited for cs2!
because you're only looking at ethots and women who crave the attention of simps.
i play overwatch
Most literally do not
Most females who claim to enjoy games play things like sims and civ and animal crossing alone by themselves
overwatch gang
I play overwatch and genshin too
They also drive stakes into the hearts of "incel" type guilds in mmos as a side hobby

So...
Btw.. we knew each other for like a few months prior to texting each other (ex coworker)
another thing.. idk how she's feeling. For instance what if she's happy and I open up a wound by talking to her again?
I mean , it seems like you really want to do it so go for it.
I'd warn you you're only doing this out of desperation though , it doesn't seem like you ever had any real desire for her.
Don't get your hopes up either , women move on very very fast and she's likely already forgotten you in any romantic sort of way.

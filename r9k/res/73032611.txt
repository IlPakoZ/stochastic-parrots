What does a kiss feel like?
Does it feel better if you genuinely love the person?
Does it even feel like anything at all if you feel nothing towards the person? 
Is it overrated? 
Does it feel sexual or like whatever?

Varies wildly. There are good kissers and bad kissers. And I don't mean just those who use tongue or can't position their mouths correctly. The lips often feel totally different and that's just biology.

What does a kiss feel like?
You know that tingly feeling you feel when you sleep on your arm or you lose circulation in your legs? Its not the painful one, its just the one that feels like marbles in your skin. 
Well imagine that, but it feels really nice and its entirely localized on your tongue.

But like.. what exactly is the feeling? Like tickling on the lips or what? 
And if you aren't attracted to the person at all, will you still feel something? 
What exactly makes a kiss bad? Will it feel like nothing?

Hmm weird. Didn't think the tongue was affected. Kind of sad that I rejected kisses due to not having a "crush" feeling, but maybe if I had kissed them I would have developed a crush.

There is no special feeling to it. It doesnt feel nice. But it will feel arousing if the girl is attractive.

The tickling radiates outward from the tongue and probably targets brain. It's hard to be objective but, from the single kiss I had in my life, it was the rubbing of tongues that radiated the sensation.

the feeling you get from kissing is more about the feeling of intimacy rather than the actual sensation. the sensation is nice but what feels good is that you are sharing a very intimate moment. When I hold my gf tight and we make out it's like we become one being.

Some lips are soft like welcoming pillows and others are hard like a trannie's throbbing muscled dick.
A good kiss feels good regardless, but it will feel emotionally a lot better if you're attracted to the person.

imo someone who could be the best kisser in the world but if there's no feelings it's just gross and weird. it's all about the emotions being intimate with someone you love brings out to me. i kissed a guy who was realistically a horrible kisser, like his teeth were in my mouth and it was kinda hurting me but it still felt so good because i loved him
it's not inherently sexual but it turns me on if i know it's gonna lead to sex

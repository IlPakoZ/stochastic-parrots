FUCK I totally wasted all 4 years of high school doing nothing but sit at home and watch anime and read manga while everyone else went out and did things and lived life and were teenagers, and I fucked up and I can't have that anymore, but I wish I had
Why would you want to hang out with normies? It's not that great.
I was talking to one my friends (all of which I only talk to at school), because I'm really fucking bored right now and was like "hey, we should hang out", and he said it was probably too late to do anything right now and he started talking about all these things he did with other people and it just got me thinking, I have had any fun experiences like that
I don't think it's late yet.
Even if you are an adult, you can go out and probably meet people with the same interests as you.
Ehh teenage years are over rated, its the young adult years of 18 - 24 which are the best. You have all the freedom of an adult but none of the responsibilities. Thats when you take advantage.
i did the opposite in middle school and i regret it

That's because nobody noticed you were mentally ill unless it was so severe you literally lost the ability to communicate or behave with any semblance of purpose.

Ironically pedophilia is no longer classed as a mentall illness, along with homosexuality and trannygenderism.

Would they have considered all the legions of white women fetishizing black cock and interracial impregnation to be mentally ill today? Thats all I want to know.

Even very conservative psychiatrists didn't think homosexuality was a mental illness. It was classified as one purely because of puritanical governments. Freud wrote a long letter to a mother with a gay son explaining that there's nothing wrong with it and she was retarded for being worried about it.

Probably because it isnt a mentall illness.
When shown pictures of adult women and girls who just hit puberty men will choose the 14 year old girl majority of the time.
Its just a normal male instinct.

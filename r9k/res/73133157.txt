I'm good with flying.
Only shitty thing happened once in Europe, when one of our plane engines broke and we needed to make emergency landing. Even had firefighters out foaming the wings etc. Then waited couple of hours in random airport, until we got moved on to next plane and our destination. Everyone got free snacks and drinks so it was ok.

i love flying its the best part of my vacation &lt;3
the calm white noise of the cabin coupled with the pristine condition of the seats make it a really comfortable ride

Fun and comfy as shit if you get the window seat. Every man should soar over the clouds at least once.

I live in NY so whenever I see a plane that isn't super high in the air I have to squint a little just in case it's happening again

I fucking hate air travel. It made me realize that i really don't want to travel the world, which makes me boring to some people

are you being ironic, anon? my flights always have people talking, babies crying, and people whimpering and praying in mild turbulence

on most of my flights the cabin quiets down alot during cruise but during the takeoff it is really annoying how every baby erupts into tears

Love flying
The sketchiest experience I've had was flying from Vientiane to Phnom Penh on a dual propeller plane and seeing smoke come out of one of the propellers. Also one time flying into Bali and the pilot had to do a touch and go (two attempts to land).

My ears hurt and there's a lot of fat people. I wish fat people weren't allowed to live. Flying is shit.

While waiting for pushback from the gate one time I realised my Champagne was too warm. They replaced it immediately.

I am a 30 year old shitskin who lives in Australia.
I am going to die. Don't know when, maybe in a handful years.
I have about $230K AUD (about $150K USD equivalent).
What should I spend it on.
My parents abused me so not them. My friends have mostly been shit and not there for me. I have a permanent knee injury so can't do longer walks easily let alone hikes. I have a girlfriend who's crappy.

Could invest some of that money so that in your will you can be made into a corpse diamond. Something beautiful and long-lasting that could even outlast humanity itself.

That's one of the dumbest fucking ideas I ever heard.
I have been depressed for about 15 years and have tried everything up to the most experimental meds. I want to do things that will make me happier in this life, not a fucking rock

I don't see how it's dumb, you expressed that you're going to die and that's something that's not going to cost all of your money but will handle how your body is handled afterwards. If you wanna just let whoever is left handle it, then enjoy just being ashes spread out and having no legacy, no mark on the world.

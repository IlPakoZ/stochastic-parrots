Been a decade and I can't get over it. Would it be stupid to find a new partner while my feelings for my ex are still there in full force? These feelings won't go away ever, but being alone is making me suicidal.

Start going out with other people and you'll feel better. It'll be slow, but you can't spend another decade pining can you?

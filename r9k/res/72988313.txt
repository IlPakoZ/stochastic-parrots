had a dream where I'm in a loving relationship with a cute transgirl
That's a first. Help me out, bros, I don't want to become a degenerate.
It was Suzi the Sphere Hunter, by the way. He gave me a blowjob and then we went stargazing while holding hands. I then kissed him on the lips, but immediately regretted it and began spitting out his saliva from my mouth. That's when the dream ended; I didn't even see his reaction.

repressed chaser
I don't want to be. What do I do?

sounds like the only choice you have is to find a cute tranny to fuck

You can jack off to trans girl porn while still dating cis women. You can't get the chaser out of you but you don't have to date trans girls if you want children or whatever.

Sounds like a great dream

That's literally just a /pol/ meme. Calm down.

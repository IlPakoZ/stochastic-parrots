A few weeks ago during one my clinical rotations, my mentor's leg brushed into mine while we were analyzing some urinalysis images. She didn't pull away and our thighs were pressed against one another for a bit. She's a very attractive Latina in her 30s, but she's married and has kids. She also asked me on my last day there "you'll be back, right?". Idk what the fuck was going through her head, but I was way too scared to make any potential moves.

Its pretty much the only music I listen to now, no matter what genre it's like healing the soul or something. Even when copying American genres, they strip away pompous, bluepilled aspects of it, leaving just the core painfilled existence. There are no rockstars, cheap simp love songs praising women and other Westoid crap.

It's hard to pinpoint what exactly it is, even something more uptempo such as this seems sad and down to earth to my ear

It's not a Slavoids are poor meme shit either, I listened to music from other Slav countries like Ukraine, Poland, Belarus (Molchat Doma home country btw) and all of their shit is either happy or really fake sounding. It also works the other way around, Russian music attempting to sound happy is 9/10 subpar.

the only upbeat russian song i can remember off the top of my head is Gop Stop, which is kinda funny because it's all about robbery

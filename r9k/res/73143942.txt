I will not watch porn.
I will not open incognito and watch porn. I will be productive instead by... uhh...
Help me out here.
Play vidya or read some manga instead.
by programming of course.
Or just doing cool shit with your computer.
Or by dabbling in electronics if that tickles your fancy.
Turn your addiction into productivity by finding a dom who will only fuck you if you get things done that you need to get done.
i dont know what it was but one day i just stopped. i havent fapped in a long time, i didnt even make a dedication or anything just one day i noticed "hey i havent fapped in 3 weeks" and decided i was going to keep it up. started always staying clothed a ton with a belt and shoes in my house to make it inconvenient as possible to whip my dick out as well as going to church every sunday to make me look down on the idea. im probably a pretty anecdotal case but if you want advice id say god is the best help, turn to god.
What is the relevance of this
I really hope that one day the other shoe will drop and no fap / no porn enters second stage where the mask drops and faggots reveal it was always a bdsm gay cult trying to turn straight guys into faggots. All in the name of jesus of course who was also a faggot with his disciple harem.

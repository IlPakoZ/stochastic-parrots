ask her if I could see her wearing it
she says only if l cosplay a character that she picks
I said okay

i think she means she wants you to cosplay that character
your welcome for clearing this up
<comment>
but the character is naked

It means she wants to see you naked.
Say something like only if she does it with you or have her cosplay as something sexy.
Alternitvly do the cosplay alone but take Viagra or something so you have a massive hard on when you take your pants off.

How do you know she wants to fuck me and doesn't just want to see me naked? If she did want to fuck me then why is she wearing a cosplay with full coverage
<comment>
Just be like i dont like to send naked pics over text. Bring the wig over and ill show you (winky face or some corny shit). Couldnt be simpler

I (24M) have a friend (23F) who does cosplays of anime characters
ask her if I could see her wearing it
she says only if l cosplay a character that she picks
I said okay
she sent me pic rel and said she has the wig
I haven't responded since
What did she mean by this?
Here's the chat log
kek go for it anon
i think she means she wants you to cosplay that character
your welcome for clearing this up
but the character is naked
It means she wants to see you naked.
Say something like only if she does it with you or have her cosplay as something sexy.
Alternitvly do the cosplay alone but take Viagra or something so you have a massive hard on when you take your pants off.
Her cosplay isn't naked though
And?
She's gon peg u, faggo
tell her you'll come over right now to try it on retard
But her cosplay isn't nude tho
she wants to fuck you, you absolute sperg. She couldn't be more clear
tell her this: i have a lot of autismo; made a thread about this convo on 4chan ppl are saying i should tell you to come over but i keep responding them that your character is not nude tho. what do
Just do it, for all the robots. Hell post the pic here after. One of us needs to get laid some time this year. You'll do
How do you know she wants to fuck me and doesn't just want to see me naked? If she did want to fuck me then why is she wearing a cosplay with full coverage
Just be like i dont like to send naked pics over text. Bring the wig over and ill show you (winky face or some corny shit). Couldnt be simpler
How do you know she wants to fuck me and doesn't just want to see me naked?
gee idk i guess she just wants you to walk around naked in public or something

in most media, foot fetishes are the most widely talked about
constant jokes about it - even a little fan service
was exposed to said media talking about it at a young age, consistently had the concept of finding feet attractive forced into my head
can now unironically get semi-hard thinking about feet
I'm fucking done for

You can get rid of this sort of thing if you repress it. If you have thoughts or feelings related to a certain fetish, you can gradually move away from it by mentally visualizing burying it into your subconscious (i.e. away from your conscious thoughts and desires)

Does this also apply to fetishes you've had all your life and really wish you didn't have?

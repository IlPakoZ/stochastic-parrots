go out to the park to try some cold approaching
approach some random girls trying to strike random conversation
after a while a cop shows up, says I need to come with him, grabs me by my clothes and makes me walk with him
I ask him to identify himself and state which article of the penal code I have allegedly violated
he just chuckles and asks me which movie i saw that in
i tell him I studied it in college but he just chuckles again and doesnt respond
takes me to police station
450 euro fine for "public disturbance"
I give up.
450 euro fine for "public disturbance"
now imagine the high tier escort you could have gotten with that money instead
what dystopian hellhole do you fucking live in?????
Fuck that. Im taking that shit to court. I dont care about the fine or how much money it costs for a lawyer
And then everybody clapped
his head
Kek, please let this be real. I'd feel less shitty about my own life knowing we're going down togheter.
his head
yeaht thats what i thought, though i dont put that sort of action above femoids, that one in particular must have been some sort of psychic because how else did she call the cops on him without him noticing
Frons.
i was warned this could happen but I thought it'd take the police longer to show up, like 2 hrs or so, giving me enough time to approach some random girls. 
The cop was there in less than 20 mins.

where you being a blatant creep for the thrill of it? or where you talking to girls like a normal person?
How many did you approach before they showed up?
I talked to 2 girls. approached 3 in total (the first one didn't even respond and just kept walking)

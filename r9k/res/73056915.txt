I really only go on r9k these days to try and see if I can find her having a mental breakdown about me. I know it's unlikely, and even if I find it I probably wouldn't know it's her. Maybe I'll give up one of these days
I like to think for a while some random anon would find me and her both schizo-posting about each other on this board and he connected the dots. Now whenever he sees us posting he's like "oh my fucking god, these retards again"

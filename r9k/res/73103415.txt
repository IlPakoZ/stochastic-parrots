Would an future AI that produces child porn videos with audio that are indistinguishable from the real thing be ethical? You would be giving people who can't be cured an outlet for their urges that doesn't hurt anyone.
Obviously there's nothing unethical about that. But that won't stop normalfags from whining about it anyway.
We already have ai child porn images anon.
Any generation of that kind of content is harmful because people with those urges should be rehabilitated, not enabled. It's feeding an addiction instead of treating an addiction.
With that logic we should ban violent video games too
You can't treat pedophilia. Just like you can't un-gay yourself, fag.
Nobody can tell.
It's a "no child has to suffer for cp" vs "Fantasy CP will create desire to act in out irl" argument.

You lied to me, /r9k/. You NEETS always talk about having great lives and getting laid by wagekek's gfs. I quit my job today that I actually liked. I thought my oneitis would be more attracted to me and see my independence and passion for life. My onetis is also engaged, but NEETS have said that even loyal gfs would fuck them while the guy was at work. I called her up saying it was an emergency and I needed to come see her. She invited me over and I sperged out and told her I quit my job because I would guarantee to take care of her and spend time with her unlike her fiance, and that love comes first before work, and that jobs suck the life of people and I am no longer a slave. She was nice but let me down.. I further dropped my spaghetti and told her she was the only innocent woman left in my life. She giggled and told me she and her fiance go to SWINGERS CLUBS EVERY WEEK. I'm basiclly a mess at this point, and for some reason ask if I can join (even though I'm single). She says no, couples only, and then I tell her I will kill myself if she doesn't hook me up with o e of her friends (I know, I was direct, but crying and not thinking straight too.) at least she said she would try.

I honestly do not see how "a job that you like" can be anything other than a contradiction in terms.

I've enjoyed working in someplaces. Comes down to coworkers and what it is you have to do.
Good coworkers make wagecucking tolerable.

Also worth noting that OP (ausfreak) copied and pasted the entire OP text nearly word-for-word from this old-ass /r9k/ thread from 2015.

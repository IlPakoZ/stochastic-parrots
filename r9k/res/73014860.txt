Why do men think that if a girl likes him, he has to make a move immediately (or all else fails)? Even though just because you like somebody doesn't mean you want to date them? And even if that were the case, you still can't make them be (interested) in a relationship with you (no matter how interested they are)?
We dont like female friends, its either gf (pussy) or nothing

I never make a move and get no where.
why does the opportunistic gender feel like they have to take every opportunity presented to them?
really puzzles my nads.
We dont like female friends
OP literally said nothing about female friends (or even friends for that matter).
Because its in female nature to take needed resources not provide them
Blame mother nature who is also a woman

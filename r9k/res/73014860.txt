Why do men think that if a girl likes him, he has to make a move immediately (or all else fails)? Even though just because you like somebody doesn't mean you want to date them? And even if that were the case, you still can't make them be (interested) in a relationship with you (no matter how interested they are)?
We dont like female friends, its either gf (pussy) or nothing
I never make a move and get no where.
really puzzles my nads.
OP literally said nothing about female friends (or even friends for that matter).
Because its in female nature to take needed resources not provide them
Blame mother nature who is also a woman

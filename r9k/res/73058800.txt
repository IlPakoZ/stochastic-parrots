I cleaned our wallet this week and I saw my college ID and it gave me the idear for this greentext 
 Be me
 December 2019
 About to start new university
 Go to student center to get ID
 Have to give the black chick working there my drivers license
 She sees my DOB, and starts talking to me about how she's and Aries too, and all of this other Astrology bullshit
 Eventually, I get my picture taken
 My expression is exactly like picrel
Ever since then whenever some roastie starts droning on about astrology, picrel is my exact reaction
irl mutuals stopped using tumblr almost a decade ago
i never stopped
had a red haired roastie stare at me untill her husband arived (like 20 minutes), then they left. i was just chilling and sitting there but roastie stared. whytho?
While I was dating my wife she gave me her old college ID. I was really happy about it for some reason. She left me but I still keep it in my wallet. Sometimes I take it out to hold and look at. I really miss her a lot. She went to Hillsdale.

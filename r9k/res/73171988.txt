I just found some texts from 2017 from a girl that made it very obvious that she liked me. I did not pick up on this at the time.
Checked, heil Hitler.
Tell the story Anon.
I read our texts together still literally years later.
Same but from 2013. Now Im a wizard.
always act as though people like you, it infuriates people who don't and opens up opportunities with people that do
The people that don't will try to fuck you over. Take the malicious pill
not really a story, it was basically a text like "see you next term" because we were in college
but she was going on about how she was really glad to have met me, and enjoyed bringing various new snacks for me to try, and how we totally need to try that restaurant we talked about next term
never talked to her again after that

Do any of you robots like mythology? My favorite mythological hero that I can remember is Beowulf. What's yours?
bybon son of phola. he lifted pic rel over his head.
Strongmen lift stones like that today so it's definitely possibly. Really cool stuff
Idk Gilgamesh I guess.
Bit normalfaggy but I like and relate to Prometheus.
For bringing fire to man and being punished for it? Or because he was freed by Hercules? Prometheus is a cool hero

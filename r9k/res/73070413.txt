About a month ago I started drastically cutting my soda intake, only drinking it on the weekends and only drinking water during the week. Here are the changes I've noticed in my life:
I save $5 a week
that's it
zero changes to my mind or body
Thank you all for joining me on this journey

Straight up, everyone who ever claims "wow I feel so much better and have so much more energy after doing x" is either placebo, lying, or x is coke

That was about the extent of change I saw too. Mentally it's 100% placebo. I will add one thing I really appreciate about not drinking globohomo sodas. Less garbage. I'd like to eventually have no garbage at all and it's always bugged me a little bit to throw so much good stuff away. 
Recently my mother got the door dash thing from kroger but they gave her normal instead of diet drink. So she gave it to me. Even when you break the box down it takes up a ridiculous amount of space. Then the cans take up even more. As I had grown accustomed to only taking out the trashcan like once a month it was shocking to see how much volume a 12 pack occupied. I prefer the cheap iced tea bags but even those have a, staple. Far less volume but I'd like to get away from that. Loose teas are somehow more expensive. One of these days I'll find a way to get the same amount of tea without the staples.

Do any girls want to kiss and cuddle but wait with the other stuff until marriage and have kids and grow old together?

This is too hard to find in the west now. Go to the Middle East convert to Islam and find a middle eastern girl if you want this sort of thing

Don't make me lose faith. It seems dishonest to convert for that.

just lol 
I got a Tinder date who said she wanted to take it slow. She took it several ways after she called at 3am just a few days after we met for a date.
You need to go to a fundie church or invest in a prayer mat to praise almighty Allah. Women like to FUCK.

That doesnt have to be the only reason. They wont marry you if you arent Muslim though
<comment>

No girl will ever settle for your pathetic tiny dick.

"why even care?" is a better question. like, wtf does OP think will change if marriage or love is in the equation? the mechanics of sex remain the same. you are waaaayyy more likely to please your partner/wife (whatever) if you have had some practice. 
seriously OP, wtf do you think will change the experience. sex is sticky, sweaty, hot, and it feels fucking GREAT. any lack of love for your partner will be replaced at the end by a shitload of oxytocin anyway. Get your rocks off, homie.

I had that plan, but when you're a teenage girl, bad things can happen when you go to parties with the wrong boys. And then you're in the situation, should I tell that to guys I want to date? ... or just be quiet and try to forget it ...

nta but will they at least pet a tiny dick and bite it a little

if you got raped, tough luck. best to forget it and hope the asshole who pronged you gets hit by the AIDS bus. if you got drunk and just fucked, there is also no point in buyer's remorse. just keep trucking. 
either way, most guys don't care.
if you're knocked up...well fuck. srry. but hey, life isn't over. just stay healthy/semi-attractive and you'll be fine.

It's 8 years ago already. I learned from it that you can forget to plan your life. Shit will happen unexpected, and ruin all the nice plans. To imagine your perfect life in 20 years, and then believe that it will actually be like that, is just delusional. It's already good luck to not be dead or in prison in 20 years from now, I guess.

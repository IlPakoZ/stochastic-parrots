day 131 of manifesting nothing
Never thought to ask, what are you actually summoning nothing for?
Nothing would like to know that too...
Master keeps summoning Nothing but never giving Nothing any commands...
He just summons Nothing and leaves...
Why?...
I desire for the void to devour us all
Nothing I already told you I manifested you by accident, what I'm after is the actual void, true nothingness and you're clearly something. Why should I give you orders?

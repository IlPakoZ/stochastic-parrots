25 years old
mom mentioned in the past that her house will be given to me to raise my wife and kids in (she thinks I'm going to get married in the future)
dad has said multiple times recently that I should have a girlfriend and that I'm wasting my looks
I have zero intention on ever getting a girlfriend/getting married and having kids. I'm just worried about how they'll react when I'm still single and childless in my 30s

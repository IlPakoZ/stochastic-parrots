Do you have an addictive personality? Post examples of your addiction or times you evaded common addictions.
I think so cause I'm fucking addicted to videogames and scrooling. HOI4 seems to be one of the more addicting ones cause I think I spent 10 hours straight on it just a few days ago, playing as the anime empire Japan. It's just an incredibly addicting power fantasy on singleplayer
I've tried alcohol before, sometimes I had rules like only once every two weeks, but nowadays I only drink once a month and I'm not really planning on changing that. Very fun though I can see why people get completely addicted to it
At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
I don't really have any dead people I wanna talk to yet, so that wouldn't really be enough for me. I am scared of anything that alters your mind, cause I don't want it to change me in any way besides just making me smarter, more organized, confident or resilient maybe. In a weird way it feels like it'd be killing myself and replacing myself with some other person that I have no control over, which gets even more terrifying when I think of other people I care about and how they'd deal with that
Do you play by the rules? Or do you feel that "if you're not cheating, you're not trying"?
I dropped out of school before it got hard enough to make cheating something to consider so I can't really say in that context. If it was easy enough to cheat then I'd probably cheat
Regardless, when it comes to life I'd probably pick cheating without being dishonest about it
<comment>
No, because it's kind to wish better for someone. It was certainly prudent.
<comment>
But how much of that is addiction (you can't stop if you wanted to) and how much of it is habit because there's nothing better to do with your time?

yes, i've been addicted to video games for years and i get addicted to people as well. i also was "addicted" (not physically) to alcohol for a time but thankfully i stopped.
At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
no, i hate when my mind is altered now.

i do whatever will benefit me the most in any situation
<comment>
I think even if I wanted to, I would get too bored with the other things that I could do quick and I think that's enough to make it somewhat of an addiction
Regardless of that, I've never seriously wanted to stop anyway. Videogames have been a habit for pretty much my entire life

What are cognitive functions?
cognitive functions are the mental processes that your brain uses to function. there are 8 functions and a type uses 4 as their main functions. since you're an ISFJ for example, you use Si (introverted sensing), Fe (extroverted feeling), Ti (introverted thinking), and Ne (extroverted intuition). look more into it to see if these functions paint a close to accurate picture of yourself.
I know that between extroversion and introversion I prefer introversion. Between sending and intuiting I prefer sensing. Et cetera. Is that not MBTI?
it is MBTI but it's a very surface-level way of looking at it. like i said before, if you want a better grasp of your type or other types, look into the cognitive functions of those types to get a better idea of how they work.

INFP female here looking for some fellow NF perspective
So I've been in a long-term relationship with a nice guy I grew up with and starting formally dating in HS. Flash forward to now where I have only 3 semesters left in college. He decided not to go to school and started working instead, so I was sort of on my own on campus. He and I have the understanding that while I am in college we are not exclusive and are free to see what happens. That doesn't mean either of us are going to go looking for anything or pursue someone necessarily. It just means that it's college and anything can happen. He's fully committed even though I never required it, and honestly that's what I love about him. He's sweet and loyal to a fault. However, he's pushed for exclusivity from me for a few years now and I don't think it would be right to promise him exclusivity until after I graduate. For me, waiting until I can actually keep my promise feels like the right thing to do. It wouldn't be right to make a promise you might not be able to fully keep even if you mean to at the moment you make it. Circumstances can change. So I feel like I'm having integrity here and doing the right thing by not promising exclusivity until after I'm graduated. But people I'm close to that I have confided in have said that I'm not doing the right thing. They've said that I'm being selfish EVEN THOUGH I never expected exclusivity from him. That was just his choice. 
Anyway, it's a really complex and complicated situation and I wouldn't mind another INFPs perspective on this.

Do you have an addictive personality? Post examples of your addiction or times you evaded common addictions.
Don't think so, unless the addiction appeals to other factors that I am searching for (escapism, companionship,etc). I was addicted to WoW for around 8-9 years. Looking back at my /played time is embarrassing as it amounts to well over a year of my life. I quit on/off through college. Doing that made me realize how much time I had wasted on uselessness. Only other addiction appears to be masturbation/fapping, and that's simply due to never having a relationship and not seeing it as possible for myself.
Have managed to avoid addictions to any drugs (never tried to my knowledge), alcohol (don't see the appeal or how people get addicted), or cigars/cigarettes (despite having had them quite a few times for social context). Many ancestors struggled with alcohol addiction, probably as a cope for depression. 
At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
yes - if the side effects were either treatable or not debilitating. I don't like when my mind is altered now, as it typically results in memory loss or me feeling like I did something wrong. I worry more about the after-effects of what I might've done, rather than enjoying the time when my mind was altered.
Do you play by the rules? Or do you feel that "if you're not cheating, you're not trying"?
play by the rules, but the rules more ascribe to my personal set of morals rather than what is explicitly written down. Those morals are a sense of my own honor or esteem. If I disagree with a law, I will likely circumvent it. Usually my own ethics are more constrictive than what the law permits. I don't like fucking other people over, so I am not solely looking out for personal gain.

Dunno. But seeing as smoking turned Jung from a reasonably handsome guy to a burned out piece of jerky, I'm not eager to find out.

Any other INFPs can't stand it when your parents openly dismiss your input whenever they offer you "help"? Doesn't even have to be just parents. It applies to anyone that dismisses your input. 
For example, my dad recently bought me a new car so that I could start going to the local community college (my..creative pursuits didn't work out). We went to a dealer lot together and I fell in love with a civic sport, but I didn't like the color. It didn't have that certain "this is the one" feeking. I did some searching around online and found another dealership about 30 miles away that had the color that spoke to me. I let him know this and he said "that's what you want? Okay....but the other one is more common. You'd be standing out in this one." I told him that's the one I wanted so I thought that was the end of it. Well, lo and behold, I come home from a week at my mother's house and sitting in the driveway is the wrong car. 
Like, I feel like I can't confront him on this because it would make me the bad guy since he's buying me a brand new car for free. And everyone KNOWS that you can't complain about a gift. But I feel so fucking disrespected. It's been two weeks now and I'm still incensed. He didn't listen to what I wanted at all. He didn't accept my input. He dismissed how I felt about it. Instead he for the color he thought I should get. 
I just hate that we are never listened to. I feel like that's common amongst us INFPs. Were like in the background and our feelings and opinions never matter.
<comment>
I'm just so pissed off at him it's not even funny. I have to be thankful though and not say anything to him, and that kills me inside. I have to act like everything is fine when it's not, when I have been forced to suffer silently for weeks now.
I am always so considerate when it comes to his needs too. Living in his house hasn't been easy for me. But I'm very aware of his needs and doing what I can to listen to him. And none of that is returned to me. I want to fucking EXPLODE

Do you have an addictive personality? Post examples of your addiction or times you evaded common addictions.
Well, sorta. I can get addicted to anything really easily, but it's also really easy for me to break addictions. Alcoholism is in my blood, so every time I drink, I see how I could easily get hardcore addicted to it. I've been addicted to a bunch of different games, and game consoles over the years, I've also been addicted to people and even weed.
At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
Sure, why not? I could do wicked pranks on people by talking to their dead relatives. 10/10 drug.
Do you play by the rules? Or do you feel that "if you're not cheating, you're not trying"?
For the most part, but I disregard rules that are... unrespectable. Dumb, unagreeable rules are free to be disregarded.
Hello, anon.

No, it's really not that complex. Quit being a wannabe-hoe and make a commitment, or break it off. "But, it's college!" grow up. You're in real "fuck around and find out" territory.

You are trivializing it and invalidating me. That's okay, you don't understand the full story. We are committed I'm just not exclusive with him. I haven't been and I can't be right now. I can see how that might cause you confusion, but we are still in a long term committed relationship and I don't have any intentions of ending things. 
Look, there's a guy from one of my compsci courses and we did things together when he needed comforted after a bad breakup with a girl who didn't value him. That situationship was the closest thing that came to what some might consider being another relationship. But it was never not going to be just a temporary thing. And my commitment to my bf never wavered during that time. My bf and I only get to see each other once ever month or every other month, so there's that. It's not that uncommon to do things with your male friends while on campus. And it doesn't make someone a hoe, either.

You will never be a real INTP woman. You have no womb, you have no ovaries, you have no eggs. You are a homosexual man twisted by drugs and surgery into a crude mockery of nature's perfection.
All the "validation" you get is two-faced and half-hearted. Behind your back people mock you. Your parents are disgusted and ashamed of you, your "friends" laugh at your ghoulish appearance behind closed doors.
Men are utterly repulsed by you. Thousands of years of evolution have allowed men to sniff out frauds with incredible efficiency. Even INTP trannies who "pass" look uncanny and unnatural to a man. Your bone structure is a dead giveaway. And even if you manage to get a drunk guy home with you, he'll turn tail and bolt the second he gets a whiff of your diseased, infected axe wound.
You will never be happy. You wrench out a fake smile every single morning and tell yourself it's going to be ok, but deep inside you feel the depression creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight.
Eventually it'll be too much to bear - you'll buy a rope, tie a noose, put it around your neck, and plunge into the cold abyss. Your parents will find you, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They'll bury you with a headstone marked with your male pronouns, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a man is buried there. Your body will decay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of your legacy is a skeleton that is unmistakably INTP male.
This is your fate. This is what you chose. There is no turning back.

It doesn't feel good to have our input dismissed like that, especially since we (INFP) make it a point to not do that sort of thing to others. Most people wouldn't understand how much something so simple as a color means to us. It's so much more than that. It's expression. It's identity. It's our voice. Your voice was muted with the flip of a finger, and as a fellow INFP I want to say I know that feeling. 
What's the right spiritual play here? We can't strike a saint, can we? But we can't allow our voice to go unheard, on the other hand.

I want to add more clarification to my earlier post. Your father is firmly, irrefutably in the wrong. Appearances may be that he's saintly, but if he thought you feelings on color didn't matter then that places him in the inconsiderate quadrant. I know you know this, and it's not my intention to tell you what you already know, I just also know that you needed validation. I meant to include it in the previous, but hesitated because I took some of your difficulty upon myself and felt like by criticizing your father in the third party that I would be overstepping. That's not my intention Anon. Please forgive my difficulty conveying this particular thought. I'm not doing so well myself lately

He's probably aware his SMV has plummeted by not going to University so he's taking drastic action to pin you down. The risk of him actually leaving you because of this is infantessimally small, he's just bluffing because he knows he's in a weak position. Him changing his mind about you sleeping around now that it's become more real is understandable, but what's not OK is if he's trying to use Misoginy to batter you down into sticking with his loser ass instead of landing some of that sweet, sweet Dr Chad rod.
It's basically like he's netflix and has decided to increase the price of subscription after a few years. There's nothing wrong with that, so long as you're both fine with splitting up if the new price isn't worth it. It only becomes a problem if he's actively guilting you into hanging around because he's provided you such a great service all these years. Ignore "the people closest to you" whoever they are lol, whenever a woman does anything other than be a straight up doormat it's "selfish".
"if it works it works" Te is just taking the objectively most efficient way of acheiving goals. If fellating your professor is the quickest way to get good grades then a proud Te user wouldn't hesitate. It's not for "social standing" or whatever it's about getting it done.

the nature of romantic relationships is monogamous and only one party here violated that
<comment>
According to you lol. That's not what they agreed to though, you can call it "not romantic" if you want but that's not the kind of relationship they were in clearly. One of the parties wants to change it into a strictly monogamous relationship and the other disagreed. Like the other anon said it's not complicated, you can't force worse terms onto somebody retroactively just because you've realized they're the best you're going to get.

Yes. A lot of things. I sometimes get too involved with video games and not realize just how much time I spend on them.
At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
If I could do it without having to worry about my health then sure.
Do you play by the rules? Or do you feel that "if you're not cheating, you're not trying"?
It depends. I used to get in trouble frequently when I was younger so I generally prefer to play by the rules now to avoid punishment.

Well yes, even if he did want a monogamous relationship from the beginning it still wouldn't matter if she didn't agree to it. Why would I pretetend otherwise? Either both parties agree on a monogamous relationship or they don't, if there was some grey area you might have a point but in the post she's been specifically telling him for years that she can't guarentee a monogamous relationship and that he can sleep around too if he wants. If he's not happy about it he can just leave and find someone who does want to have a monogamous relationship with him instead. But oh wait, he's aware that he's only in this one because they were childhood friends and they "formalized" their relationship in freaking high school. Turns out patriarchy cuts both ways and you can't demand total loyalty from the first femoid you pee on and then turn around and be shocked when nobody wants a guy who stacks shelves at burger king to be their protector, investor, hello?

okay now i get it. 
i agree that how much of a naive whore she is dosent really matter, and think the responsibility to end it fell to him initially. after he agreed though it fell to her to end it. then when she didnt back to him and so on. now its back to her. so she is not exempt from blame. she has the power to break it off and so has the same amount of responsibility, ie blame, as he does. she would have more if she was the guy and less if she wasnt the one to suggest an "open relationship". is that sexist? yes. its also basic etiquette.
i think you should be harder on the girl but everyone else isnt being hard on the guy at all so i guess you exist to balance it all out. i think their both horrible. 
based.
<comment>
Why should she have to do anything differently when she holds all the cards? She only has a responsibility to break it off if it's causing him a great amount of suffering, by the sounds of it though he's just getting greedy and jealous because she won't be his personal urinal for nothing in return. 
I find the game of assigning blame to one person or another to often be a waste of time though. Especially since the relationship hasn't even collapsed yet so there isn't even anything to blame anybody for. If we're "blaming" someone for it being non-monogamous then yes it is her "fault". But the complaint seems mostly to be that she's upset about being accused of being selfish for her behaviour, in which case the only people to blame are the people closest to her for stuffing their noses up in her business.

Do you have an addictive personality? Post examples of your addiction or times you evaded common addictions.
I definitely do, I've noticed how I feel more functional with alcohol and how it's hard for me to let go of who I am with it, as if every time I'm drinking I feel pressured into drinking more so I don't go back to my regular boring self. 
I also become addicted to my crush's attention but I mask it by not talking to him for days, though that can be easily confused with being obsessive. 
At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
I think I would use MDMA because I've read how confident makes people even after the effect has worn off. 
I have never dealt with loss or no one I cared about has died so far so I would only talk to the dead to ask specific question if they were from a time period I'm interested in. 
Do you play by the rules? Or do you feel that "if you're not cheating, you're not trying"?
I try to play by the rules, most of the times though I would always try to find shortcuts for most things and if I feel left with no option then I would relay too much in my luck (and intelligence?) and cheat.

They are a little clueless on the intricacies of social situations for sure (think INTP), but on the other hand they can usually recognize the fact that they're clueless, so they avoid those situations and avoid acting too autistically. You would on the other hand expect them to overanalyze everything, and try to compensate rigorously with their thinking for their weak Fe.

<comment>
I am a bit older compared to the crowd here, so my perspective is broader than most. First off, you've not done anything wrong from a moral standpoint. The people in your life telling you that you are selfish and wrong are misunderstanding things. They don't have the key that unlocks the full truth. Their blindness is because of their preconceived notions on what a relationship should look like to them. They are judging you based on their own blueprints. If the relationship you have with your partner works for both of you then at the end of the day that's all that matters. The relationship is YOURS and not anyone else's. Naysayers are subconsciously attempting to control your sexuality by imposing their judgments onto you. Recognize the passive misogynistic attempts for what they are and ignore them.
When I was in college (INFP as well) I didn't get involved that often with guys the way you are, but the taste of that constant temptation was not foreign to me. I didn't have a bf at the time, and I don't think I'd have mingled if I had one, but you'll never have the amount of opportunity you'll have in college again. It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing and you should enjoy your youthful spirit and energy before life stops being as fun.

Do foxes even have a concept of cheating? Thanks for making me read a bunch of fox sex bullshit.
https://www.wildlifeonline.me.uk/animals/article/red-fox-breeding-mating-monogamy
Many foxes have a stable partner with whom they raise cubs year after year but, contrary to popular misconception, this does not mean they're monogamous. Genetic studies among Bristol's foxes suggests at least one-third of litters had multiple fathers
Sounds ... familiar.
On average each litter was the product of two fathers, although anywhere up to seven different males may have been responsible for siring a single litter. More interesting still was the observation that, of the 30 litters for which paternity could be determined, only six (20%) were sired by males from the same social group. It transpired that, although both dominant and subordinate vixens mated with males within their social group, the majority of cubs produced by subordinate females were sired by males outside their group. Dominant and subordinate females produced cubs with dominant and subordinate males from other social groups, but dominant vixens didn't produce cubs with subordinate males from their group. Dominant individuals of both sexes reproduced at every breeding opportunity, while the subordinate individuals only did so 40% (males) or 56% (females) of the time.
At the same time, it seems that a dog fox can be 'duped' into helping raise the litter even though only some of the cubs may be his. Indeed, the Bristol team observed that dominant males continued to provide food for the dominant vixen and her cubs, despite some of the cubs being the progeny of a rival male. This suggests that male foxes are unable to discriminate between the cubs that are theirs and those which aren't.
I guess that settles it. INFPanimals.

I bet you never once asked your father about what happened. maybe the other car got sold? you claim that you defer to his needs but here we see the opposite, here we see you not even being interested in hearing his side of the story. that is top tier ironic for someone who claims to listen to his father. you're not doing it, only saying you do.

ESLs are always from some disgusting rape culture, the only reason France hasn't been cancelled yet is because nobody there knows how to use the internet. "Good Girl" means exactly what you think it means, ESLs see women as dogs they can cum inside. "Good girl" means you are good for having dicks put inside, same with "Good Woman", although most of the time they won't offer you that much respect. I didn't believe it to be true, but when I went to Europe I could see women who obviously just existed as sex objects, it was quite disturbing, surreal, and I'm not sure how they weren't having a 24/7 existential crisis about it.

Do you have an addictive personality? Post examples of your addiction or times you evaded common addictions.
Yes and no. Not addicted to drugs or the usual sensual stuff. But I am addicted to my principles. Unfortunately I must admit that there is a part of me that wants to be seen by others as a living example of Good. It's a consuming desire, actually. Not a desire to be praised or anything, just recognized. Acknowledged. Being a paragon of virtue is alluring and it does fill me with a sense of power the more I put Good into practice. The more I help others the stronger I feel.
At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
I wouldn't experiment with drugs like that. There are often hidden side effects that make it not worth the risk. 
Do you play by the rules? Or do you feel that "if you're not cheating, you're not trying"?
A part of me does fantasize about giving in to impulse and cheating with a girl. I'm not even with a girl currently, but it's still a scenario I think about in order to get off sometimes. But that's the lower part of me. My higher self would never do that.

I bet you never once asked your father about what happened. maybe the other car got sold?
I bet his father never once asked the son what he'd like now if the other car got sold, and just bought whatever was convenient at the time without further consultation.

Definitely in the thread that's for sure.

<comment>
are there lots of ESFPs itt? or INTPs?
<comment>
we can't know the full story. for all we know the father did ask and that INFP conveniently omitted that detail in his posts. my brother was the same way. when they tell you what happened, they're actually weaving a story about how they *felt* rather than what actually happened. if you put that INFPs entire post through a translator, what would come out the other end is just a retelling of his emotional experience rather than the truth. he just wanted to how he felt his dad wasn't listening and to him his feelings are truth. with them there's always multiple truths. I've had enough INFP firsthand experience to know how to sift through their shit
<comment>
It wasn't INFPrincess, I was kidding

My higher self would never do that.
What kind of broken logic is this? "Yeah, I hurt you, but my (((higher self))) would never do that to you."

the color that spoke to me.
"You'd be standing out in this one"
You two both sound like absolute autists.
I guess it runs through the family.
Instead he for the color he thought I should get.
Have you even brought it up with him?
I have been forced to suffer silently for weeks now.
You're such a fucking drama queen, amazing.
NOBODY forced you to not talk about it.
But I'm very aware of his needs
Does he fuck your asshole every other night or what?
That Anon's father neglected his son's emotional needs in favor of his own.
You have absolutely no idea how this shit went down.
You are going by the emotional account of some random person who wrote something online.
It's very well possible he actually gave into his father when he was asked again or something. Dude even said that he hasn't brought it up since.
People like him are in the wrong, since they don't actually face their problems. And sometimes their problems are other people.

why are people obsessed with INFPs here? ESFPs have the Fi, way more chill and are way better in bed. better girls for sure.
<comment>
conveniently omitted that detail
Yeah that happens all the time so you might be right. At the same time it sounds like you're projecting your brother onto INFP Anon and in reality he might not be as similar as it seems, so who knows. Either way, all I wanted to say is that it would be equally bad if the father didn't consult Anon again when there was some problem with getting the car he wanted, as it would be if Anon didn't ask him after the fact why he bought the wrong car instead of quietly resenting him.
<comment>
I'm pretty sure that's just his way of saying that he would never actually do that. Something can be fun to fap to but not something you'd ever actually do in reality.
<comment>
why do you think INTPs and INFPs are trannies?

<comment>
I have had an INFP say something similar to me before. He had issues with being verbally abusive toward his gf. Nothing physical, just would lose his cook and let his anger lash out verbally. Perhaps abuse is too strong of a word, but he would definitely speak hurtfully due to anger issues. I was also friends with her as well, and it was an interesting situation where I was friends to both equally. They would each confide in me about their relationship or about the other, and I never misused that trust. Anyway, long story short, the girl told me that he would always be so sorry afterward and would be in tears for what he'd done. The way he explained it to me was very similar to that INFP you quoted. My friend also split himself up into two selves; one that was primitive and egotistic, and one that was more "him" and better. He said that sometimes he couldn't control his primitive part and it would take over, and his actual self would never hurt her. And he hated himself for not being able to stop his bad side. 
So yeah it seems like an INFP thing to split themselves up into a good side and a bad side, kind of like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The thing is I've always gotten the intuition that they do that in order to dodge personal responsibility. It just seems a little convenient to be able to tell someone you hurt that it was the "bad" part of you that did and the "good" part of you would never, EVER do such a thing..
<comment>
He's talking about superego but he's framing it fancier to avoid his responsibility for himself.

I feel like being ANFP in this one
Do you have an addictive personality? Post examples of your addiction or times you evaded common addictions.
Very much so, impulsivity and lack of self control combined with a constant desire to experience intensity
In terms of substances it started out with coffee 5-6 years ago (help im getting old) , was at a sleep over and got made a coffee so strong it barely even counted at a liquid at that point
felt euphoric all night and stayed up for 24 hours
then I started having it at home and it felt really fun, had all these ideas blossoming, felt social and so on, also lead to me making music and even made some money off it too
Tolerance happened after a while and the negative effects started outweighing the positive ones, like feeling tense and stressed, decreased sleep quality etc.
Next one was alcohol, discovered in 2k18, a state of mind I never felt before, did it 1-2 times per month that year 
Got into it again end of 2021 and it was really fun for a while but I kept doing dumb stuff I regretted over and over again
lately it stopped being fun, stopped buying it now (still have stuff thats at home but its less than half I used to do atleast..)
At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
Psychedelics always sounded very interesting to me, heard about them "curing" addictions, helping with depression and such
Personally I am quite worried about psychosis as I am rather neurotic, perhaps something I consider doing in the future
just get a vape doesnt mess you up nearly as much
well youll probably end up consuming 10x as much nicotine so maybe not idk
this is either a high effort psyop or the psyoppers are right
<comment>
Do you play by the rules? Or do you feel that "if you're not cheating, you're not trying"?
Rules are supposed to lead to good outcomes, for either oneself or others, if I feel like not following one will lead to better outcomes I wont follow them by that logic ofc

I understand that you needed an outlet to vent about your brother, and I am happy to provide that opportunity for you. Use my post for catharsis if you need to, I won't invalidate your experience. But just be aware of what you're doing and that you've used me as a hook to criticize your brother, not me.
you need to stop resenting your dad behind his back. be a man and have a talk with him, you limp faggot
I would never be heard, so there's no point in doing that. He didn't hear me before, it stands to reason he won't now. Besides, I gave him an opening to discuss this and he never took it. He asked me in passing in the kitchen very casually how I liked the car. I said that it was great, and I said that "I guess the color is okay" letting him know that I wasn't quite satisfied with it. If he cared then he would have picked up on my dissatisfaction and he would have ASKED me what was wrong. Instead, he just said "okay, that's great. I'm glad you're liking it." Proof he didn't care to hear me at all. So why even bother talking to him? 
I would have responded to you and answered your questions honestly if not for your radiant hostility and name-calling. You do not have a good, genuine interest in understanding, only condemning. Have a good day.

Did you read a physical copy of it?
And whats the reading experience like, stuff like Jung feels quite dense and hard to read
Never was into reading much except as a kid, and especially when reading stuff digitally its just so easy to let your focus slip as stimulation is just one click away (plus I can barely see my screen while sunmaxxing &lt;.&lt;)
I like lectures, especially back when coffee was new, focus felt effortless and I could explore inspired ideas simultaneously while processing what I was hearing too, it was great
Sometimes I wish I was less "self aware", atleast in terms of how "I feel" or what my emotions are like, overthinking that kind of stuff seems detrimental in many cases

Nobody joined so I closed the tab lol. Waiting for anozzle to come back to start a new game. Also it's getting kind of late so maybe it's better to book a time slot tomorrow night or Saturday or Sunday day time. Diplomacy is a long term game, two slots left if you haven't joined. Dune is more of an everyone pays attention for 2-3 hours sort of deal.

I won't explain how that was supposed to not be redundant because it ended up that way

That didn't even happen because he went to do his reading thing lol. Oh well, I can set up a new practice game now if you're still in the mood, but I'm starting to get a bit sleepy. At least I know there's some interest. We're more likely to get 6 players if we book a time slot ahead of time.

Do you have an addictive personality? Post examples of your addiction or times you evaded common addictions.
Most certainly. I feel most of my days are just chasing one high or another. Thankfully I'm not some junky in the sense of popping pills, but society has many many forms of slop to get you hooked. 4chan can sometimes be an addiction, same for telegram and whatever else I use the internet for. Alot of times it doesn't even really satisfy me at all. I just mindlessly scroll, wandering around aimlessly in hopes that something will captivate me. Porn was an issue for a time but I've gotten alot better. I only seem to escape the cycle if I really have a better place to be, or I decide to go on a walk or do chores or something. Sadly my ride is messed up right now so that's made it even harder as of late. But I'll bounce back
At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
That's a pretty good question. I think it depends on what type of drug we're talking about. If it's something that can fuck me up, like meth or coke or even lean or something, I'll pass for sure. I've been around enough dope fiends in my life to know the shit ain't worth it whatsoever. But if it was maybe a weed or something? Sure. I've already tried it anyway and didn't get addicted at all. Maybe being more in tune with Te or other useful functions would make me more likely to become addicted, but it's worth a shot especially given I've never gotten addicted to weed or alcohol (fuck alcohol desu, nasty shit). 
I can't stand these ultimate larpers. They genuinely need to be sent to re education camps. It's the only way to actually cure their inner illness at this point.

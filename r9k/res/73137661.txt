I just want to make a woman happy..but that train is probably long gone. I can't shake my negative thinking, I'm addicted to hating myself and only seeing negativity, it's over.
Direct that anger towards something anon ?
Yikes thats pretty pathetic anon. Women and children are annoying to associate with.
Liking romantic stuff is not gender specific
and they say that sex and opposite sex touch and love isn't a human right lol
look the state of this nigga
It's over. Just wait until the basilisk that rises from the sea (AI) will kill us all very, very soon.

think that shit qualifies as cyber self harm or something.
i do the same and nothing has me lying in bed staring at the roof feeling so empty i cant even cry or lash out quite like romantic anime or visual novels. it makes me think how i fucked up my school years, how i fucked up my teens, how i fucked up my early adulthood... blew every chance i had leaving me orphaned by experiences i never had. had my reasons for being like that but i didn't have to, i could have been different if i knew how bad things would get, how good they could have been.
alcohol used to be a fucking godsend for this. it let me forget about it. let me sleep easily without worry. let me escape into my mind like i used to as a kid and thinking it will work it self out eventually. i cant drink anymore now because my alcoholism has been destructive, just getting worse and worse every time i start. if i dont stop now there isn't a chance in hell i'll ever get better. i'll probably not anyway but i cope by telling myself that i can drink later but i cant stop and get the years back later.
didnt read lol
Regret is the worst feeling there is and it just keeps coming back again and again over and over.
I often try to distract myself from things like this with random hobbies that I pick up. 
But recently I heard a song in the car with the line "we all kissed in restroom at the party" said in a way like it was some sort of relatable "rebelion against system" that we all went through at the young age. I immediately went into vertigo over all things I missed/fucked up.
Oh so you're a braindead retard. Don't worry mate, no amount of therapy or pills would have fixed that.
I have respect for people who go that way but it's just not for me.
just try harder, bro, you got this
What do you have to offer to a woman besides being an emotional wreck
I'm funny and have many interesting hobbies and worldviews, also I'm edgy and have a big dick. 
Who am I kidding. Nothing but myself. It's over.
In which part you get a job?
Why would I get a job when I can live perfectly fine off welfare? 
Just kidding. (Not really) I'm not ready for a job. I'm starting a 15 hour/week social program soon where literal retards and other mentally I'll work. I hope that shit helps me..

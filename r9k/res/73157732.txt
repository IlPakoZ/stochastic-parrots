The stigma of it more than anything.
I'd happily go a lifetime without it, were it not for people thinking it's some kind of moral failing

It's in a man's nature to want what they've not yet attained. Plus, more than anything, I think my virginity is holding me back. That because I haven't yet had sex, it means I can't have sex, which lowers my confidence, and makes other aspects of my life harder.

I try not to, but that doesn't stop people from acting differently if they catch wind of it.

Might have to do with reproduction being one of the strongest drives. We might have separated the act of sex and reproduction, but the spinal cord doesn't know the difference. That's how genes get passed on.

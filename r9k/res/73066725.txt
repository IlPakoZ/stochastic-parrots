be 2006
go to preppy middle/high school
multiracial (50% white, 30% black, 20% asian, 5% mexican)
everyone is a arrogant jock prick or a preppy shithead
all of them like to fight
be pushed into bathroom by group of students that bully me in class after lunch
forced to fight 250 lb football player
lose, obviously
everyone laughs while im on floor bleeding
entire school starts to bully me for it
all my friends are a grade above me so no one to help
decided not to tell my family and friends because I assume they'd tell me 'jest fight all of them bro!'
verbally put down every day and treated like an animal
manage to beat up one of them
everyone still bullies me as if nothing happened
continues for three years until 11th grade
new school has normal, nicer people but the damage was already done to my development
go to college
drop out
therapist says i have acute inferiority complex, likely due to the smug nature of my old peers
be 5 years later
pull it together and start a business
make over six figs
all the people who bullied me live mediocre lives, are ex-felons, or are in jail
feel like i won
call mom, cousin, and aunt on Skype
show them a few of the bullies
my mom compliments one of the worst ones because he graduated honors and 'isnt bad looking'
immediately return all her christmas presents and slowly stop calling them altogether
Anyone else know this feel?

Your mom is a cunt. Mine is the same way. Not worth cutting contact with her over, but definitely keep her at arm's length

JUST HIT THEM BAAACK
I always loved that bullshit, they send you into jungle alone, what's their tip? "be violent" and you know they don't want to deal with that from you at home or if you get expelled from school, fuckers

i only recently found out that minors could be charged with assault and battery. the internet was booming enough back then. I blame myself for not educating myself on my options

What's your business like? Could you teach me how to get on the right track? I was bullied too, but now I keep struggling to make money and buy food
<comment>
you just need to find something that either numerous weirdos or normalfags at large would buy. then you save up money and put a plan together to sell it. you'll have to do a lot of reading if it is in any way electronic or technical

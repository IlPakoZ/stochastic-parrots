why are anons here so retarded?
<comment>
"i would rather have sex with men than women"
"umm actually you are retarded for calling me gay"
<comment>
I agree, anon. You should be with the best person you can find! So therefore, I say: Death to the idea of lowering your standards! Death, I say!
<comment>
i think it was a dramatic showing of how anon would rather do anything else fucking retard
<comment>
Its a dramatic showing of how much anon would rather have sex with men with aids than his female looksmatch yes.
Its either Stacy or gay sex.
He will not settle for ugly women but he will settle for gay sex with men though.
Which makes him basically gay.(noone is 100% gay or lesbian theres still a 0.01% man a lesbian woman would go for but she generally prefers most women over most men so shes a lesbian)

There's way more non-overweight women than there are men who are 6'+, yet for some reason the former is considered to be "high standards" while the latter isn't.

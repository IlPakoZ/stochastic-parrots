Search for it in the catalog after posting. If that doesn't work, maybe you put in a filter and it's being applied to your own threads. I don't know.

Could be, just some possibilities I thought of. I have had posts made in threads act like they posted then never show up, but that is rare.
I have this on my phone too. It's a phone from 2012 though so the browser is very outdated.
I have the latest fucking iPhone with the latest fucking Chrome and use incognito so the browser is stock everytime. Even switched browsers so same thing.

The more i regret every damn decision i made during my pre-teen/teen years, i was an absolutely piece of trash to even people who didn't deserve it and i was friend with, maybe i deserve being bullied
Seek Christ and repent.
Waow it is Sunday guise time to go to churmch
I was a pretty terrible teenager during my high school years but I don't feel bad about it; I just act differently. Maybe you are gay OP
I don't believe in god, but i wont judge you if you are religious
I changed aswell, but i'm still too much of a chicken to say sorry if i need too, also because i'm starting to forget a lot of stuff so idk
I feel this. I was a mean asshole to one guy in particular (and others sporadically) and I feel I deserve the punishment of being alone and depressed now. He is doing well and is even married and happy. Karma is real I guess.
Nobody cares if you don't believe in God
Go to church and tell the pastor that he's wrong during the sermon LOL
Me too. I wish I could go back as adult me and punch the shit out of my younger self.
Except the people who were even bigger pieces of shit than me are doing even better than the people I was a piece of shit to and unlike me they never even stopped being a piece of shit. It's all random.

Everytime I walk past someone in the middle of the night, I either try to trip them or slap them on the ass. One guy tried to beat the shit out of me but couldn't grapple me. It's the funniest shit. Sometimes I will insult people when they're walking across the street from me. If it's a woman i call her a slut or a whore and if it's a guy I'll call him a faggot or a pussy for avoiding me. I love it. I love making people mad. I love seeing the fierceness in their faces. It makes me feel powerful.

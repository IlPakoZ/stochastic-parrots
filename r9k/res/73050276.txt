I've always been really into music history, i know all of western music chronologically, and i realised earlier that there have never been any substantially prominent female composers. The only one i can thino of off the top of my head was Clara Schumann. Even in modern times: how many female jazz players do you know? There are ironically less female composers AFTER the early 20th century than before.
Popular music ??? Just singers, and not very memorable at that. Basically just dance music which doesn't really have great artistic merit. In the 60s you had hippie chicks wailing into microphones because the corporate fat cats knew it would make money, and in the 70s you have maybe 2-3 bands fronted by women. I cannot think of any notable female composer, or all-female band. Why is this? Why is there no female Led Zeppelin?

Because women are incapable of creating things.

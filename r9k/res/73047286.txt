who's cooler, mexicans or brazilians?
Mexicans. Brazilians are usually gross, dumber and weirder(if we're talking about the northern kind). Mexicans have lots of cartel/gang warfare and a bloody history.
Mestizo mexicans are cooler than mestizo brazillians but mulatto or pardo brazilians are cooler than all mexicans
I like Brazilians more because of Chico.
Average Brazilian looks like Chico
Average Mexican looks like Mexican Andy

Honestly Brazilians usually seem like chill, down to earth honest guys and Mexicans always seem like creepy weirdos who have sinister ulterior motives they are trying to hide
Both are extremely hot when in the oven
i tire of brazil. now i move :(
I can't control it, that's why I never leave the house.
Mexico has suffered from internal coups and interventions for most of its history. 
Brazilians overthrew the Portuguese and established their own empire.
In principle, the answer is obvious.
That happened in Brazil too. Mexico also called itself an Empire.

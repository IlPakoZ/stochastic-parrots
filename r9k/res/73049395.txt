I've gotten it in my head that I want to do open mic stand up comedy.
Someone talk me out of it so I don't publicly humiliate myself.
First time is easier than the second since you get the boost of nerves. Do it once.
if you've never talked in front of a crowd before and dont practice you will be dogshit and humiliate yourself
Wait anon, that's the opposite of what I asked you to do
Thanks anon, keep it coming
Anon is about to become the Joker(2019)
As a former comedian once told me "DO IT FAGGOT!"

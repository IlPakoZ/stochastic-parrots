Alleynefag is Acaz (a BPD lolcow) , and he uses Alleyne as a guise for his innocent depressed elflover persona. In actuality, Alleynefag is a gay, alcoholic ERP fiend from the depths of /trash/, he also frequents /afgg/ on /vg/ where he found a guy called lain, paid for his plane ticket and allowed himself to be assfucked by lain, who instantly left after the act. Alleynefag is still spiteful about this and even leaked his address on /vg/
He creates another thread persona with Holo from Spice and Wolf, and uses it to endlessly harass and insult Urabefag. Urabefag was (seemingly) close friends with Sayafag, and Alleynefag interpreted this as some hot gay love affair that he wasn't in on, so he got upset and used the Holofag persona to try and drive them away. He even said that he was "jealous of their chemistry".
He faked a suicide attempt during this, and even responded to himself (as Alleynefag) with the Holofag persona.
He eventually reveals being the person behind Holofag, then spends about a year posting intermittently while focusing mostly on ERPing, alcohol and getting assfucked by strangers.
A few months later, some anon posts links to the vg archive where the whole assfucking thing is discussed. He comes here, attentionwhores more, then stops posting in waifu threads altogether. This happens like a year after the holofag thing, if my memory is right.

Buy a finnasteride prescription instead
Noo that'll kill my dick I won't even try it!
Then just go bald and shut up over it.

I tried that and it gave me gyno. Stop pushing your quackery on me, Jew.

That shit has had no effects on me so far my hair is doomed to die it seems

Add dutasteride instead

so far
I bet you've been taking it for less than a year

which one is it faggots? I take the pill for another 6 months and risk losing more hair or hop onto the nuclear ballbuster?

I've been getting bouts of extreme dandruff/scalp itchiness, and when I itch my hairline hard enough it doesn't come back. So now I have an uneven hairline, but no balding. Fucking sucks.

A study came out linking soda consumption to baldness. So you should try cutting out sugary drinks entirely, everything, and all caffeinated drinks as well. Stress will also cause baldness, so try to stop stressing. Also if anons say it takes more than a year to work, just continue on with fin for another 6 months and see how it shakes out.

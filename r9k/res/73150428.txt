been working out almost every day for these 2 months, mostly muscle workout
only eat 2 meals a day, occasionally 3, not super big and not unhealthy
drink energy drinks super occasionally but that never affected my weight before
eat fast food only once every 2 weeks, usually subway
pretty sure its fat
thighs, calves and stomach got bigger
although no more hip fat or double chin (like i had last time i was at this weight)
dont have that "fat" feeling though
feel pretty healthy and dont get anymore tired or exhausted while working out or walking
can still walk 2-5kms no problem
still gaining weight rapidly though
gained my last 2kgs within 3 days
WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING WRONG FUCK FUCK FUCK

how much sleep are you getting
 2-3 meals a day are you tracking cals and are they mostly protein and fat or just doodoo carb goyslop
are you drinking bevs that have calories in them
I woldnt get too worried. Worst case scenario youre just accidentally bulking and will gain muscle fast. could also be water weight. make sure youre drinking a lot of water and lower your salt intake
<comment>
anytime I haven't obsessively tracked caloriers I've gained weight. It's torture but especially if you life with other people like family it's the only way to be sure

You're consuming too many calories. Just stop buying garbage.

i get around 6-8 hours sleep per night. i also do count my calories and eat around 1500-2000 on a normal day unless i eat my third meal which will usually put me in the 1800-2200 range
its got protein but also carbs, i eat lots of curries, casseroles, and sandwiches of chicken or tuna, or french toast, just shit like that
i drink a lot of water, and i have an energy drink every few days. i try not to eat too much salt and even use salt reduced butter, and low carb potatoes
im not buying garbage, i eat healthy and cook my own meals. and i only eat a maximum 2200 calories a day, and thats on a rare day
<comment>
make sure not eating too close to sleep, and besides that maybe its a health condition like another anon said, water retention. count your calories bro, one meal a day and no more than 800-900 cals lost me 8 pounds in 2 weeks
<comment>
i sometimes nap after eating dinner, that could be one of the reasons as to why
i count my calories and im eating below average to average amounts of calories. id cut back to one meal again but everytime i try to i feel like utter shit and physically burnt out. im currently taking meds that make me very hungry too so it makes that even harder
could be water weight though, yeah

eat fast food ONCE every 2 weeks, usually subway which isnt that unhealthy
drink 0 calorie 0 sugar energy drinks

<comment>
cope you're still eating fast food regardless. only drinks that don't gave calories is water. keep coping.
once every 2 weeks
that's a lie and you don't know it there's no way in hell you're keeping up with that while eating drugfood
<comment>
what the fuck are you talking about? drugfood?
i cook all my own food and i KNOW what i eat. i eat fast food once every 2 weeks when i get paid since it's a treat. you dont know what i fucking eat during the week better than me you fucking tard
and i drink mostly water - only energy drinks occasionally. i buy 1 4 pack and maybe 1 extra every 2 weeks too

you'll just have to drop a couple hundred extra calories. make sure youre always weighing yourself in the morning after poo and shit every day and look at your weight over a week or so as well
<comment>
yeah, ill probably have to. i usually weigh myself in the morning, after my first meal, and at night, and it went down 2kgs and then went back up and its just kept going up over this last week, despite the fact ive been more active this week and eaten less
i also dont weigh any less after shitting lol. i shit twice or more a day which indicates my metabolism should be working. but it isnt. gross, i know
<comment>
i cook all my own food
And you still eat like a fat ass. gar-rent-tea the shit you're cooking is like worth of 900000 calories and fat and you call that a single meal
just stop coping bro it's pathetic. you took the L
 you dont know what i fucking eat during the week better than m
I do cause I'm better than you cause I know I am. simple as.
cope or rope

Muscle is denser than fat, anon. Weight isnt the only scale of measurement to see if youre getting fat. Just look at yourself in the mirror and trust your eyes
<comment>
You're not neccesarily doing anything wrong.
It is very possible to have a highish body fat% while still being healthy which sounds like what you are right now.
If you're looking to lose the extra weight simply consume less calories, don't cut out too much all at once gradually bring it own over a long period of time and consider doing more cardio, just know more cardio will mean less muscle growth.

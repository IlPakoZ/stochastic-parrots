The new soda that's taking the world by storm is one that isn't for the faint of heart. Called 'Drink at Your Own Risk', this soda is not only dangerous but comes with a unique curse. Taking a sip of this soda will cause fat female authority figures in their 50s to randomly appear in your life and fart all over you.
The experience these women bring with them is one of humiliation and embarrassment. They'll show up wearing skimpy and revealing clothing, exposing their crusty buttholes. Then they'll start farting all over you. As if that wasn't enough, they'll also act as your nannies, not allowing you to eat anything but eggs and ham salad. If you think of misbehaving, you'll get a spanking and a face farting.
This soda is not only dangerous, but it also has serious implications on your social life. Imagine trying to explain to your friends why you're always surrounded by a cloud of farting old ladies who tell you what to do and make you eat gross food. It's enough to make a grown man blush.
Drink at Your Own Risk is a soda that is to be taken seriously. It's a warning to anyone who takes a sip you're taking your life into your own hands. If you don't want to be cursed with fat female authority figures and their farting, then think twice before getting this soda.

No, no, you misunderstand; OP jerked off first while conceptualizing this and THEN when he finished he penned his masturbatory material to post with a conscious clear, and a mind unburden.
If my kidneys weren't so fucked up to the point I can't drink soda anymore I'd drink ten whole cases of these.

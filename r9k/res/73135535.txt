Any fembots want to get married?
any country is fine Canada included
Just for fun to try it out and say we did prove all our friends wrong make some people jealous
We'd bank on the wedding my family is well-off and well plugged in the LDS community so they'd pay for our wedding we'd get tons of gifts and money gifts. 
After that you could have citizenship, $400 extra neetbux we'll get is yours, 
are more than welcome to live with me in my flat
it's a good sized condo you can have your own room and we can just take it slow be each others friends and companions though i will give you loads of space right and am not controlling. dont need you to be a maid or do dishes or laundry just be yourself.. we can hang out on the internet all day and do what we usually would do but just be together and stay comfy for as long as we like
Depending on if we get sick of each other I'll probably join the military after a few months so you'll have the house to yourself just take care of cat and stay comfy
lmk what you think i know it seems silly and isn't the most romantic proposal but it would be an adventure if nothing else.. hope to hear from you xoxo 
Sincerely, 
The OP
im not reading all that shit faggot just want to let you know you're gay and retarded.

You're totally unloading responsibility for your actions and failures onto this place, actions and failures that would've happened even if you had been a reddit normie. Maybe you would have even trooned out by now idfk everything you did made sense in the moment. The reality is a kid spending his summer on the computer is already loserish this site didn't do anything that wasn't already happening to you

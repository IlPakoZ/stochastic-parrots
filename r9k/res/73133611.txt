Told my dad I am a feminist and dad said "not in my house, go do that at someone else's place"
Do you even have a job?
It better not be a "feminine" service job. You better be turning wrenches or have a C-Suite title like a real feminist
Are you M of F? Is daddy a boomer?
Your Dad sounds like a real shit head. Let me be your eDad (not sexual).

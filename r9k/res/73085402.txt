Bro I'm balding and wear a hat every day can I still get a gf?
Try very short hair. If it gets bad start shaving head and get nice tan. Hell grow beard and be like barbarian. Even having no hair issues, I'm considering it myself.
lol dude. nobody cares. throw on a baseball hat of your favorite team. most people are too worried about themself to worry about your hair. youre good.
No because you lack the confidence to not care about it and try to hide it. The trick to having confidence is to just not give a fuck, as a warning though overconfidence can result in problems too.
get a snake and wear it around your neck
cooooooooooope.
fucking whitepill brainwashing kikes
have fun getting laughed at and rejected cause of your poor genetic sequence loser op hahaahahahha
I saw a bald guy getting a hug and a kiss from his girlfriend at the door of her apartment building. You can do it too (if you leave this site)

so i was looking at a cosplayers ig and shes at a con and she reposts people that took a photo with her and everyone in those photos looks like an absolute looser i cant imagine actually posting that on a social media account like wtf do this people have no self esteem? they all look like faggots idk why this bothers me so much but i think that is making me want to become /fit/ im gonna start tomorrow how is your da going /r9k/?
You should look at what people at conventions are like
yeah like why is he taking a picture of them? is he gonna fap to them later? wtf
He's taking a photo for the memories
i see feet
Here's a photo from the 4chan meetup at anime north and colossal con
any idea why there were so many women?
And what appears to be so many of the same women
i get what you mean. I want to at least look decently fit.
I'm surprised there are so many of them
Maybe they like different things compared to normie girls so they find comfort in talking about things on 4chan kind of like us 
And this place is honestly so entertaining and nice, fuck stuff like reddit, this place is better
excuse me this post is problematic

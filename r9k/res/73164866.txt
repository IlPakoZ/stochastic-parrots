Here's a photo from the 4chan meetup at anime north and colossal con
any idea why there were so many women?
<comment>
And what appears to be so many of the same women
<comment>
i get what you mean. I want to at least look decently fit.
<comment>
I'm surprised there are so many of them
Maybe they like different things compared to normie girls so they find comfort in talking about things on 4chan kind of like us 
And this place is honestly so entertaining and nice, fuck stuff like reddit, this place is better

Is stalking fetish a thing? Feels like if I asked any gf that I want to stalk her she'd just be dumbfounded. I want to follow her from afar as she does her daily routine and then watch her from her bedroom window in the dead of night and such.

normies are terrified of that
one of the most famous stories on r/nosleep is similar to that

i want a girl to stalk me instead. but i'd be too boring. i'd just go up to them and talk and invite them in my house.

I'm not sure about this image macro. Guys get upset too about noticing patterns that challenge their beliefs.

Rape fantasy/CNC is a thing, obviously. Free use is a thing, where you're getting off on them ignoring or being nonchalant about your sexual behaviour. Those both have similar vibes, but I can't say I've seen someone talk about a straight up stalking fetish before. Generally dudes want to get to the part after the stalking where you, you know, burst through the window and rape her or whatever.

I just realized that one is far more popular at least online and I never even considered a guy version could exist.

I have messaged my ex good morning every day for a year now and I randomly send her gifts and text her stuff to let her know Im watching her social media. I will do this forever until I break her
I want to break her and when she finally comes back I am going to drop her because I hate her

Sounds like voyeurism only misinterpreted.
Maybe OP should look into voyeurism and ask if his gf is cool with something like that.

I just posted in another post that this is 100% my fetish, this is my top fetish out there. It's one of the main reasons me and and my ex-girlfriend broke up because I was infatuated with stalking her when we weren't talking. Just the thought of knowing I was watching her and she knew it and sometimes she would get scared and start crying. I love when they cry. For them, the fear of the unknown is the biggest high for me. However I have rules, you never approach and you never get too close, but you watch them closely, taking notes from afar. Also, I have a rule of no pictures. If I get stopped by the police or they get a warrant to search my phone I can't have 50 fucking thousand pictures of the chick I'm stalking. So, I'll make innocent notes instead. I use a set of code words so again, if the police stop me and ask what I'm writing down it's not for example "this morning she was wearing a red coat, blue shirt, tight blue jeans, white socks and black shoes, probably vans." - that's obviously too fucking suspicious, so I make certain phrases that would seem unbeknown to someone glancing at the paper.

Perhaps they are similar but voyeurism seems more sedentary. I like stalking because it's more like hunting to me.

A certain breed of females literally love that if you're attractive

they're lying
should i kill myself?
depends. do you want to?
<comment>
Because they are confident enough to post about it. I make NOTHING

There are plenty of robot or cyborg Big Tech types around these parts. I'm in engineering, but not a FAGMAN, and in a lower cost of living city, so I only make $125k. I'm also a principal engineer at 28. Sometimes, people are just good at their jobs/interviews and get to make a ton of money.
should I kill myself?
My answer is and always will be yes, of course, OP. You are a faggot.

i'm in europe. when dumbmericans say 125k 150k 200k do they actually mean AFTER ALL TAXES? like are you hitler himself in '41?
<comment>
no, almost exclusively they mean salary before tax
<comment>
Pfft ahahahah
You actually believe the shit people post here? 
Let me guess next you tell us you believed everyone also has a 7+" cock
<comment>
No that's base salary, before taxes and not including bonuses.
<comment>
the question was not how people make 150k per year, but how people on 4chan make 150k a year. My point stands
<comment>
We are all nerds. Programming computers or engineering makes 100k+.
No, if you make that much income the government takes 40%, and the state can take a little more on top of that.

more importantly, should i kill myself?
Not until the pain of existence is unbearable and inexcusable. Live out of spite, be the biggest fucking pain in the ass you can be to this shitty, disgusting world. Leave your ass marks all over reality as it kills you.

I'm pretty sure I told you though man... you work in engineering or at a super successful company. Most of the losers here are introverted overanalytical autism-spectrum types. You really can't see how the same crowd could do well in engineering or big tech?

when i was a kid, 80-100k was a flex. now that has turned into 200k. when i finish university in 2 years, 300k will be homeless threshhold

Don't live in CA, Denver, Chicago, or New York then. Problem fucking solved.

passing an interview would take basic social skills. This does not line up with the demographic of 4chins
<comment>
good engineers know how to launder money
<comment>
Working in an office takes even more advanced social skills. Most of the time the faggots that brag about making a gorillion buxx while antagonizing their coworkers get a hard crash when their mediocre output is no longer worth the trouble of their insufferable personalities. Then they learn why the legal profession exists. lol, lmao even.

We aren't all losers in the same way. Personally, I was a mentalcel. But know it's that I can't find a decent woman at my age. I'm still alone most nights. I've mostly been coming here because "you're here forever."
Others are extremely off-putting because of their autism, but FAGMAN don't care. That means they will work hard and care way too much about the details, which is sometimes good.

4chan users' employers eagerly hire H1b indians who can barely even speak english.

4chan used to be a place full of creative and interesting people 17 years ago. It's hard to leave even with the drastic increase in genuine retards who post here now. I would expect a lot of us oldfags are well off relative to the average person.

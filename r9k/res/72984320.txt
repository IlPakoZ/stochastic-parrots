How the hell do you afford to use DoorDash everyday? I mean a lot of you are NEETs. I tried DoorDash for the first time today (Papa Johns) because I had a $10 off code, and the total before the coupon was $29.28. I compared it with ordering in person, and it was only $15.50.
Furthermore, I wageslave 20 hours a week at an Amazon warehouse for $17. I always drive out to buy fast food in person, even when I'm not going anywhere else.
I don't know how people do that shit either. I used to love it because it seemed like just a delivery service but then the restaurants caught on and now it's not even worth it. The price of a meatball sub from subway was like $9 when I first started using the delivery apps, now it's fucking $21 and that's without the raised delivery fee, service fee, driver tip.
Gotta be rich or from neetbux central. I got federal grants from the government for attending uni. Spent like $6k on food. In hindsight, should've saved it. But for a moment, it was chinese food every day.

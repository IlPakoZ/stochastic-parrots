Why is it so hard nowadays to find a traditionally feminine woman? It seems like every girl today is either bisexual, has a penis, is gender non-binary, has body modifactions, or is just really trashy. I just want a girly girl, traditionally feminine, maybe even kind of a diva, soft with a good figure, sweet, gentle, smart, wears pink and has beautiful long hair and wants a comitted relationship. Why can't I find this?
This exact problem is why trannies exist in my opinion. Men want feminine women and when they can't find them (and a vulnerable mentally) they try and become one.
I don't want to cut my dick off. I want to be a man still. I want to put my penis in a vagina not have a vagina.
Why is it so hard nowadays to find a traditionally feminine woman?
Because traditional roles are fucking dead. They were propped up on delayed gratification, which essentially needs religion, high trust and a future worth living for to keep working. 
Now that those are all essentially gone, it's nothing but do as you please, and no one puts in any effort anymore, ergo the traditionally roles die off and the society soon follows because nobody is playing the social game anymore than they have to.

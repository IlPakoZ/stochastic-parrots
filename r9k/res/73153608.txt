Films like this are fucking gross. It's just torture porn.
I will do anything to reach my phone, but its just to look at cute pics of cats :3
Delightful kino. What film is this, may I ask?
terrifier 2
Anyone got that webm where it's an anime pixel girl in a gate type thing?
You know the one
torture porn
A term only faggots use.
Reminder that the movie which spawned this term, Hostel, only had like three fairly short torture scenes in the whole film. Hysterical normies should stick to shit like The Conjuring.
holy based movie, I saw it in the theater while eating some yummy donut holes. very comfy experience
Such a kino scene

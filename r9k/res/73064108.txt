Hey guys I have a question. When I was 13 I used to suck this one guy off that I knew in high school. I did it for about 3 years pretty regularly. Once every two weeks at least. I liked it. Fast forward 15 years and I still like it. But heres the thing. I do not actually like guys. Idk wtf it is. I have been regularly giving head to this guy I worked with in 2016. I suck his dick at least once a week, sometimes more. I have done this since 2016 with him. Anyway, sometimes I think I am gay, or maybe bi or whatever, but idk. I just do not like guys. Almost every guy I see, there is no way I would want anything to do with them. But for my buddy, I get excited to suck his dick. Like really excited. I love doing it. I do it while he plays video games with friends and chills and I honestly love it. Wtf does this mean? What am I? Why do I like doing it with him, but get grossed out at the idea of doing it with literally anyone else? Idk. Just looking for ideas. Thanks.

Try sucking my dick, it should help you figure out stuff

You're a free spirit and you get to define your own identity

Who says you have to put a label on it? Maybe you are just into this particular guy and the thrill of the taboo

Wise.

My findomme said she's getting bored of me because I don't talk with her enough. I'd talk with her more, but I don't know what to talk about

Not only paying a "findomme" to interact with a girl, and yet she expects you to lead/start convos KEK
the ultimate cuckery

What do you get out of this? You know, you can just talk to Pygmalion AI for free, right?

She's real and not AI, and I like it when she calls me a good boy
Yeah, I know. I just wish I could talk to her more

because I don't talk with her enough
It's a trick to get you to interact more and pay her more.
I'd talk with her more, but I don't know what to talk about
Send her AI generated poetry.

You are such a faggot for paying some used pussy to talk to you in the first place. Do better.

Send her AI generated poetry.
No, wouldn't sending her poetry be weird? 
I know, I'm lonely though, and I don't see myself getting a gf anytime soon

Probably but so is sending her money for just talking to you.
Does she insult you humiliate you when you hand her the money?
How tall are you?

I know, but I can't help it
I'm 5'4
This isn't me

Unironically connect chatgpt to respond to her
<comment>
Wouldn't she be able to tell that it's an ai bot?

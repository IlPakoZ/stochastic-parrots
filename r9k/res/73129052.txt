life as a 5'8 male with an ugly face
<comment>
you should know by now, sex is for chad, not for you. whats for you, is long hours working at a factory doing hard labor for low pay, so you can pay taxes and support one of chads many children and single mothers.
<comment>
Yup this is it. What im actually going to do is kms and tap outta this shit though
<comment>
it actually is bro. you won't be having sex at any point in the near future. maybe in around 30 years if you work hard, you might get an old woman who is finally ready to settle down and spend your money. things are better this way, its better when chad has all the sex and and we do all the hard work. they don't usually make us watch them thankfully, most people reading this don't even know all the women they see outside are sucking and fucking chad. literally all of them.
<comment>
I wish I could try out a dating app, unfortunately I'm too anxious and avoidant.
<comment>
Not avoidant and anxious enough to come here and whine to gigantic faggot. Enough with your made up mental illness.
<comment>
I want to maim and torture women (in minecraft that is)
<comment>
you aren't anxious and avoidant, you just already know that sex with cute girls is only for chad. do you remember your first love? shes swallowed chads cum. what about your second love? her too!
<comment>
yeah, it takes a lot of confidence to talk to gigantic faggot. i wish i could meet him but he's so busy.

take the geomaxxingpill
take the surgerypill
take the acceptancepill
These are the three paths for incels to be happy. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise and I'm 100% sure a large portion of us will make it and be happy in the end. Don't give up on happiness, bros. WAGMI
<comment>
Sorry I meant to say I have a pattern of avoidant behavior that causes impairment of personal functioning
<comment>
I'm 5'8 and only ever met 1 girl off the apps. And it was because she knew my friends
Much better luck at bars and clubs. Stop being a pussy and hiding behind your phone
<comment>
Take the goofy nigga people and enjoy life like a simpleton. Life is too short for dealing with women and normies just to get yo dick wet or play pretend with some girl. Just chill brah
<comment>
Fuck dude, I actually do hard labor in a factory, it's 27 an hour though.
<comment>
Don't listen to this guy btw. If you're not happy with being a eunuch slave drone all your life, then make drastic changes for your own happiness
<comment>
get back to work slave, your 4chan break is over

6'2 white with good face
Download Tinder
26 matches in 2 weeks
90% don't reply to first message no matter how jestermaxxed or cool it is
The remaining ghost me when I try to set up a date
80/20 rule doesn't apply to dating apps. If you aren't top 1% of men then you get nothing.

do you really not get any of these, ever?
<comment>
Also want to point out I put in a lot of effort. A ton:
Got a good degree and make 100k+ at 25 
Have my own place
Finances in order
Moved to a large city in an area with lots of people aged 20-30
Follow all of the hygiene/grooming advice
Dress well
Have friends and hobbies, interests etc
Active social life 
Including normie and female friends
Workout and am in shape
In therapy
Good with animals (if it matters)
Took a variety of pictures including group shots
Hired a photographer
Detailed bio prompts etc
As for IRL i have never bene asked out despite being very active socially
Dating is entirely looks based, that's all there is to it
<comment>
And if I do ever get a GF i am going to cheat on her just out of spite
<comment>
I am not a eunuch slave. I just jerk off when I want. I also don't want lovey dovey bs because it's all fake.
<comment>
im 5'7 and my gf is 5'10 you're just ugly and boring
<comment>
I didn't have much luck on bumble. Also 5'8. I usually get a couple of matches per week on hinge. Have only been on two dates in like 4 months though lul
<comment>
guy wins lottery
"heh all those others who didnt win the lottery are just bitter"
lmao ok little guy
<comment>
This is why I cannot blame any incel who goes ER. The western world is an open-air prison if you aren't chad. Women rights has been a complete disaster for every western country that has implemented it.
<comment>
Unfathomably based. Its has been a disaster for society and our wellbeing. Incels need to actually organize and start a revolution. The random (((shootings))) dont help
<comment>
What the fuck is this pic, you got a "like" but it's just trying to make you pay. Is this some kind of pajeet tier scam?
<comment>
No, that section is just where your likes show up. Guess who has none
<comment>
What stops you from becoming the 1%? Nothing thats what, I don't want to hear incel excuses. Clearly you just don't deserve to have sex.
<comment>
Do people genuinely believe they'll do any better if they were just a few inches taller?
<comment>
I mean, it's really dependent on the person.
<comment>
In what way? I mean has anyone tried chadfishing as a manlet to see if it matters for chad? Genuinely curious.
<comment>
All of my hookups came from when I was "6 feet" tall. Not very many at all and they were not good looking.
<comment>
statistically your chances go up exponentially? 
Its almost like saying
Do women genuinely believe they'll do any better if they were just a few kilos lighter?
If a fat woman lost weight in a few months it would change her entire. If a man could suddenly gain a extra foot it would change his life forever. 
The tragic part is that women can actually lose weight whenever they want but we can't change our height.
<comment>
So manlet chadfishing doesn't work then?
<comment>
I tried this and got banned off tinder,hinge,okcupid, and POF simultaneously.
<comment>
women literally filter out men by height on dating apps
<comment>
Same here. I recommend you embrace the no pussy no work philosophy if you can
<comment>
lmao seethe while i sleep with my cute gf every night
<comment>
Yeah that's pretty much me, society is cold but I will feel warmth when it burns.
<comment>
this. unfortunately dating apps are what they are. i'm 5'10 but lie and say i'm 6'0 on bumble (everyone lies on there so you kinda got to, game theory shit) anyway, yeah just go to bars there's simply no chance online if i'm mostly getting landwhales and of whores and i have a decent looking face.
<comment>
Here I'm anonymous and faceless.
<comment>
atleast you get alot of matches, faggot. kill yourself.
<comment>
Here is my supernova black pill that would turn planet Vegeta into ash
You need friends to make friends, money to make money and genetics are your fate. You have a hard limit and once you reach it no amount of effort can change it 
People peddle and sell you false hope as ways to make money and some legitimate believe in what they say. But you cannot beat your hard limits and your environment growing up is essential
<comment>
The fuck? They banned you for being a manlet? Or they just caught on to the catfishing? Hard to believe tinder normies have enough self awareness to catch on.
<comment>
You could just pay an escort. I have no idea how there's unironic incels here, just careermaxx and fuck whores. 
I fuck a 10/10 Stacey every week despite being a 5'8 manlet because I pay prozzies. I also have a good career and make 8k a month and I spend 1k of it (per month) on top tier whores every friday.
<comment>
Lot's of normie guys do well on dating apps, you need very good pictures (look up guides online), a gym body, and you also have to be white and you can do well on tinder/bumble.
<comment>
Surgerypill is retarded, just get a gym body. Someone did a tinder experiment with AlphaDestiny (5'4 manlet gymcel youtuber) and he did very well on Tinder.

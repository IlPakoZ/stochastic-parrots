staring out the window at some normie passing by my house
he turns and looks directly at me
he sensed your bde
I often stare at the people passing by, but they can't see me through my window shades. It's like I'm not even there.
We're just observers in this world
We are like god, watching everything behind the scenes while nobody can do anything about it, 
what more would you want from life?
Hahahhahaha

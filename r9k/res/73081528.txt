Are transpeople allowed in the conservative movement?
Conservacucks literally allow gays, blacks, and feminazis to represent them. They fucking LOVE pick-mes for some reason.
Yeah Blair White exists
you can be allowed anywhere as long as you aren't an annoying retard
no don't do it and all that stuff is like asking for super karma
There are no "trans". Its literally all made up
They are a key part of the conservative movement. As long as everybody's talking about your dicks or lack thereof, we will never get a serious conversation about universal gibs. So thanks very much for that, fucker.
If a trans woman whips an 8 incher and makes you wear a skirt and cat ears you better believe you are a girl now, bitch.
Transphones know your place.

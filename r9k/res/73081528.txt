Are transpeople allowed in the conservative movement?

Conservacucks literally allow gays, blacks, and feminazis to represent them. They fucking LOVE pick-mes for some reason.

no don't do it and all that stuff is like asking for super karma

There are no "trans". Its literally all made up

They are a key part of the conservative movement. As long as everybody's talking about your dicks or lack thereof, we will never get a serious conversation about universal gibs. So thanks very much for that, fucker.

If a trans woman whips an 8 incher and makes you wear a skirt and cat ears you better believe you are a girl now, bitch.
Transphones know your place.

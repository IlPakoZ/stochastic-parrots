Gf emotionally cheated on me with a man she never met online. 
I want my ideal family. All women are ultimately the same. No matter how good you are they will find something to be unhappy about and cheat on you-aka lizard brain.
I will get her to agree with me cheating on her as a way to get her lizard brain to realise that I am not a weakling for forgiving her. She already agreed to this. This way I kill her selfish lizard brain and subconsciously tell her that there are consequences for her actions that I am not willing to take. She disrespects me again in any shape or form, we are breaking up.
Opinions.

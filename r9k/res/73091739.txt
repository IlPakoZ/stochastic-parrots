Do you watch porn really loud on your tele?
bro has ptsd to porn aint no way
if someone moans near bro he gets a seizure
didn't we tell these kids that they won't make it in the real world? i swear i remember them being sassy as fuck to us. 
has anyone invented noise cancelling headphones or going outside for an hour?
It would be a legitimate complaint to have but then I read the "muh ptsd" part and realized the poster of this is a wimpy faggot who cries when he hears porn. How do people become this weak?
I have never in my life heard porn, ever
I always muted since I was 12
Is this normal?
back to tiktok with bro

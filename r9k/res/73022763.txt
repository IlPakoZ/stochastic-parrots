ever notice how women over 30 have dry unvibrant hair? Is it because they fuck it up with hair dye and chemicals or is it just because they're old?
yes.
also because they brush too often.
Women lose hair too anon, just not as frequently and as much as men do, and when you lose hair it looks flatter/less vibrant.

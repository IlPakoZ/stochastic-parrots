Why don't tough working class white kids exist anymore? Where'd they go?
They disappeared when whites offshored all their jobs to the Third World and started naming their kids pussy names like Todd, Blake, Blair, Blaine, Brent, Taylor, Tyler, Jordan, Flynn, Cody, Dylan, Cameron, Tucker, and Kyle instead of badass names like Eddie, Joey, Johnny, Phil, Bobby, Tommy, Danny, Bill, Mickey, Vinny, Tony.
You live in a society!
In one where a gazillion playgrounds had to be closed because everyone was too afraid that one brat might fall down, break a nail and then you had to fully expect that its parents would sue the owner into oblivion.
good times, weak people etc.
Why don't working class kids exist anymore?
Because the working class doesn't exist anymore.
because child labor was outlawed in 2022
I Never thought about how much cooler oldschool white people sounded like
They still exist in Eastern Europe
They still exist but they are a dying breed. Chavs outnumber them 10 to 1.
And chavs are physically weak pack animals who cant fight.
They don't have to scrape coal off the beach to survive anymore
they got invoked for pure evil time and time again

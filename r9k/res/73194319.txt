Sit down anons. I will tell you why. 
Usually I'm a lurker but I need to share this. I am a 22 year old Gen Z. Growing up, my dad taught me how to work in manual labor since I was a kid, and groomed me to be a hard working, self sufficient man. I now live on my own, own my own business, I go to the gym, dress nice, and financially well off. I am over 6ft, fit, and decent looking. I drive a nice car, have a nice place, and am very physically active. As a man, I know my value. I have had attention from women before, and dated here and there in highschool. I spent 3 years after school working on my business and have done extremely well. Not going to college, I haven't had much social interaction, thus how I ended up here. The business isn't as much work as it used to be, so recently I have had some down time to relax and pursue some hobbies I've been putting off for years, one of those hobbies being dating. My goal before I am 28 years old is to get married and start a family. 
For the last month I've been on every dating app possible and tried to speak to women my age. And let me tell you, after spending a lot of time back in the dating scene, I absolutely refuse to be apart of this utter nonsense. TikTok, tinder, and the media have made women's standards absolutely fucking insane. I know I'm not a Hollywood actor level of attractiveness, but HOLY FUCKING SHIT, what the fuck actually happened? I once went on a date with a girl and suggested we split the bill, as it was a first date, and got rejected because of it. Apparently splitting the bill for sandwiches is an "ick" and explaining how "splitting the bill is a proxy for relationship dynamics" what the fuck? - this same girl that was proclaiming to me that she's a boss bitch and had an paid internship at some big tech company.

i keep telling myself one more fap, one more puff of the weed vape but its never one more. i took my "last" hit of weed in 2017, after a short break ive been smoking almost every day for the last 5 years. before that i smoked for years as well. there's no slowing down this wicked machine until you jam the gears and grind it to a halt. otherwise it'll take you straight to hell.
I won't lie to you dude, quitting makes you feel like shit. I threw away all my papers and my bong, all my tobacco and haven't bought weed since last year. I used to smoke them together out of the bong multiple times a day. Stuck in a loop of relapses and I finally decided one day. This is my last hit. Had my grandpa come over and watch me throw everything away completely and totally about a month ago. So no weed in the last 6 months, no tobacco in the last month. You will make it man, one addiction slaughtered at a time
It's because of me. I've replaced all your "weed vape" with fart and you're getting high off of my noxious fumes.

People like me weren't supposed to have friends.
I don't know why I've bothered, I shouldn't have if it always ends up this way
What happened bro? Originally
I shouldn't grow attached.... Next time, if there ever is a next time I'll just leave before I act this way again. It's so unfair that I can't just be normal.
who hurt you this much anon?
Friend that I'm really attatched to said she wasn't sure if she could trust me and now I'm having a tantrum everywhere I can
I do this shit to myself I'm just a massive pussy. I dig myself even deeper in my brain
If I never had feelings then everything would be so much easier
Why can't I just be a machine
One bad thought leads to another and they keep multiplying. My mind hates me as much as my body and soul hate me

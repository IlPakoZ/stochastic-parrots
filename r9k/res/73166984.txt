in the shower thinking about why it's so hard to pique the interest of a woman
have a grim realization
women have been socially engineered by the entirety of media, including websites like reddit, into believing "compliance is sexy," but in a twisted way
you can comply all you want, but you'll never be attractive if you don't pass the ultimate shit test
to summarize, you must fit in with society perfectly when it's rewarded, but as soon as it isn't, you need to act interesting by rebelling against it
in other words, you MUST have two different personalities for sexual success
one values society and does their best to advance their career / social standing (public or around kids)
while the other is ruthless, takes advantage of losers who work hard for them, cold-hearted, and takes shit from no one, especially women (any private adult social situations)
this is the epitome of the dark triad archetype, as it demonstrates machiavellianism, dishonesty, sociopathy etc.
as someone who cannot and has never had any intentions of being like that, it is literally impossible for me to get a gf
really thinking suicide is my only option as an autist. it's impossible to understand what women like because it changes all the time, but it always involves complying by being socially successful and marketable, despite the fact that doing that involves denouncing society's norms themselves.

this is also a blackpill when it comes to making friends as well. no one wants to be friends with "man that is just trying to make money so he can be alone longer"

End it only if you are ugly or a gigamanlet or both. Autism is a cope. Only true primal failo can stop you from scoring.

i'm neither but it literally doesn't matter. my point is not about looks whatsoever, people uglier than me score all the time. the problem is that i fundamentally do not want to participate in society and that women are brainwashed to only give a chance to someone who does.

Yeah, like what else is there to do. What else is there to do, stare at each other until you die of boredom?

i'm autistic. i don't want anything besides sex and vidya and i consider that being free from the system. i only consider women who make the same decision as a potential equal

Indeed man, ive been realizing the same thing while in university because despite all my efforts towards being successful academically (3.3 gpa), i will still never get anywhere without putting an even greater amount of effort into socializing and social skills.
My current difficulties can be summed up with the fact that I never have anything to say to people. If i want to fix a problem such as this one, i summize it would require i induce myself with the stress of a full time job, which as a full time student, just sounds miserable.
My only desire in life is to experience a bunch of hallucinogenic drugs and have a family, so by 30 (assuming i can achieve the former) i will just off myself.

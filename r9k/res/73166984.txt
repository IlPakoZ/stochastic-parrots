really thinking suicide is my only option as an autist. it's impossible to understand what women like because it changes all the time, but it always involves complying by being socially successful and marketable, despite the fact that doing that involves denouncing society's norms themselves.
this is also a blackpill when it comes to making friends as well. no one wants to be friends with "man that is just trying to make money so he can be alone longer"
End it only if you are ugly or a gigamanlet or both. Autism is a cope. Only true primal failo can stop you from scoring.
i'm neither but it literally doesn't matter. my point is not about looks whatsoever, people uglier than me score all the time. the problem is that i fundamentally do not want to participate in society and that women are brainwashed to only give a chance to someone who does.
Yeah, like what else is there to do. What else is there to do, stare at each other until you die of boredom?
i'm autistic. i don't want anything besides sex and vidya and i consider that being free from the system. i only consider women who make the same decision as a potential equal
You ain't gonna get woman with that
you think? what do you think i made this entire thread to discuss
Indeed man, ive been realizing the same thing while in university because despite all my efforts towards being successful academically (3.3 gpa), i will still never get anywhere without putting an even greater amount of effort into socializing and social skills.
My current difficulties can be summed up with the fact that I never have anything to say to people. If i want to fix a problem such as this one, i summize it would require i induce myself with the stress of a full time job, which as a full time student, just sounds miserable.
My only desire in life is to experience a bunch of hallucinogenic drugs and have a family, so by 30 (assuming i can achieve the former) i will just off myself.

They want to hold onto my young I feel

I have the day off work and usually get baked as fuck, but I haven't considered birthdays as a reason for celebration since I turned 30.
last year i mentally told my ex happy birthday despite not being together for billions of years
he will never know
No, because I'm an adult and am not narcissistic to demand a day about celebrating me

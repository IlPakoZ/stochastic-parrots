I take herbal ones and they really help, but if I wake up late at night I feel so weak, I use them only if I know I have over slept in the morning and i'm gonna be wide awake

What do you take? trazodone could have me sleep all day, I struggle to wake up afterwards, the thing is too fucking strong.

I take two of these about two hours before bed, if I have eaten I wait an hour or so

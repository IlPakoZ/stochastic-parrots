fun fact: 27 years ago today, my grandparents and some other relatives came very close to being murdered
my grandpa thought the price at the port arthur toll booth was too high considering they just wanted to get something at the broad arrow cafe, so he turned around and drove back
they noticed that a couple of cars behind them was a dude that for some reason had a surfboard on top of his car despite it being close to winter in south tasmania
and then in a nearby town, they noticed a metric shitton of ambulances rushing past

You will never be a real incel. You have no autism, you have no negative canthal tilt, you have no deep seated emotional resentment. You are a well-adjusted man twisted by irony and memes into a crude mockery of a stone cold virgin.

I have psoriasis on my face that nothing clears up
Tell me I'm capable of finding a mate
Do it faggot
DO IT

I have rosacea and was born with a rib cage deformity. I'm a freak
No one will ever love me.
<comment>
All the rejection you get is two-faced and half-hearted. Behind your back girls love you. Your parents are proud and happy for you, Stacies swoon over your masculine appearance behind closed doors.
Women are utterly smitten with you.

I am married but get called an incel all the time. Checkmate, Chad.
<comment>
masculine appearance
I have no chin or jawline to speak of and my face is so disproportional it looks like my face is crooked
I have chipped crooked teeth, unsightly stretch marks on my arms, a small dick, and earwax problems that make me smell weird
I'm a loser in his late 20s who cant do anything right
I'm a gross fatass who gets angry at the slightest things
I have ZERO redeeming qualities

Thousands of years of evolution have allowed women to sniff out chads with incredible efficiency. Even incels who pass look strong and charismatic to a woman. Your deep voice and good sense of humor are a dead giveaway. 
And even if you manage to earn a little online incel clout, you'll get cancelled the second your DMs get leaked and everybody gets a glimpse of the e-girls thirsting over you. You will never be depressed.

deep voice
I have trouble controlling the pitch, tone, and volume of my voice from all the yelling I've done by getting irrationally mad at things all the time
good sense of humor
I have no personality to speak of beyond anger and fear

tfw actually have autism, negative canthal tilt, small chin and deep seated emotional resentment.

You wrench out a fake tfw no gf every single morning and tell yourself it's going to be miserable, but deep inside you feel the happiness creeping up like a weed, ready to bless you with unshakeable confidence.
Eventually it'll be too much to bear - you'll find a girlfriend, marry her, knock her up, and have seven healthy kids together. Your parents will praise you, happy but a little bit sentimental now that their little boy has finally grown up.
They'll spoil the kids with candies and toys, and every acquaintance for the rest of your life will know that you're a fakecel. Eventually you will pass on surrounded by your loved ones.
Your body will decay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of your legacy is a family that misses you dearly. 
This is your fate. This is what you chose. There is no turning back.

I'm 27 and have no friends, never kissed a girl, hate everyone I interact with, and can't hold a conversation to save my life

If fuckers get to call themselves 'women' because they felt like it today, I, for motherfucking sure, will call myself an incel whenever I want, regardless of the originally intended meaning. Bitch.
<comment>
Well i'm short "euro"-fat and socialy stanted, not to mention virgin who never been in a romantic relationship at 22yo.
And frankly saying that what you say to some anonse in this thread is an act of insulting gasslighting as my parents saying the same shit.
<comment>
Good. Why don't you and your underage friends go back? This is the robot board. "Incel" is a R*ddit term that wasn't used here before 2018 or whenever it was that your community got banned on that website.
<comment>

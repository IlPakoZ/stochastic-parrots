I just woke up to my mom screaming and I heard a bat squealing as she wrapped it in a towel and took it outside...
was the bat cute?
Post a pic of the bat (if he's alive ) bats are awesome
I used to catch these guys all the time at my childhood house. They would always come in through the basement, and my room being down there I would always encounter them.
I got pretty good at harmlessly catching them with a pillowcase and work gloves, before letting them go outside.
Ended up earning a few bucks over the summer getting them out of neighbor's houses. Cute little buggers.
Call 911 and have the animal submitted for Rabies testing. In the meantime tell your mom to thoroughly wash any bite wounds the bat might have given her. Rabies has a 100% death rate don't play around with it. Bats being awake and in contact with humans during daytime is a red flag.
This of course is only if the bat bit her, if it didn't, carry on as usual bats are cuties
Nah, it looked like my OP pic. Little Midwest brown bat. My cat was chasing it around the apartment and my mom was screaming (not crazy screaming, she just didn't want to get bit).
Your pic is probably a fruit bat. They have like little dog faces.
She let him outside. We don't kill them.
We get 1 every couple months. They come through the heating vents I think. It was really warm out last week 70s-80s and now it's down in the 30s-40s again so they are coming back inside for warmth.
It's 11pm here and she didn't get bit, luckily.

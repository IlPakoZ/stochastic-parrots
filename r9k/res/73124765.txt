How can I stop this? I am literally dreaming my life away

i don't know, life sucks and you're not the god of it unfortunately. you probably can't face that is my guess.

I usually turn more into daydreaming mode when my life turns more into a piece of shit. To me it's a consequence, not the cause, so if you don't want to be like that just make your life better

Nice made up mental illness. You guys will blame it on everything except yourselves except you aren't arthoes so noone have to pretend to give a shit for getting laid.

Turn it into a creative passion through writing or drawing.

back in school i would daydream so much i'd absentmindedly walk into the pole like structures outside on the way to classes

I concur. You can write down ideas or stories that might seem interesting, I too am a severe case of the daydreaming sort, so I opt to put my ideas somewhere in case I need them. Hell, I've even made 12 stories, 3 prequels to those, and visual novel scripts for 1-3 spin offs because of how much I've daydreamt just this past year.

Same boat. I think I'll try to channel it into short and long term planning so that I don't waste that masturbatory reward entirely.

Based. I draw comics on my own and I have been a daydreaming autist since I was a kid and always drawing my shitty ideas and I bump into walls and people in public because I'm always living in my head constantly.

I used to do this for stand up comedy. In my mind I'm the funniest man to walk the earth. Then I realized that most of what I was writing was not really clever nor all that funny and I'll never put it into practice anyway. And somehow all my bits devolved into jokes about sex despite me being a permavirgin.
Also, your daydreaming actually has potential. For me it became an absolute cope, there's only one story and I'm always the hero fighting evil with my dumb friends and the love of my life (I have a crush on a famous streamer, it does not get more pathetic than this).

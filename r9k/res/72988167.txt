They are much better conversationalists than men, IMO. If a woman likes you as a friend, you can generally count on a reasonable level of attentiveness, and pretty long replies to anything you say (no male-style 'grunt answers'). They also seem to understand rapport and 'vibing' better than men do. Any time you talk to a woman you are, in fact, communicating with her, as opposed to with men, where 'talk' is often just an arena for competition, with no actual rapport being established. 
inb4 I know a socially retarded bitch who gave me one word answers and couldn't vibe
Yes I know some women can't communicate I'm just talking averages here. I know some baller male communicators, I know some 6'2 women, ya know?

I LOVE CHATTING!!!
You sound like a woman yourself. Maybe you should just transition already.

Peoples' personalities have different aspects. In addition to being chatty I'm also really risk tolerant, for example I've always started businesses rather than getting 9-5 jobs. So I am pretty masculine, while also appreciating the feminine realm.

I've found the reverse experience. Women are accustomed to men leading conversations so they're pretty bad when it's their turn to talk. The only things they can talk about are the most vapid shit.

You do have to lead, which is why you ask questions, specific questions to which they can provide detailed answers.

I know that, but even then it can feel like getting blood from a stone sometimes, which isn't a problem I've experienced with men. Don't get me wrong there's a lot of guys that only talk about the same shit like football, but usually when you get talking to them about something with more substance they can hold their own.

That's because women are more open emotionally, they're still fucking dumb and are just using you as an outlet for their verbal diarrhea. Try getting a woman to listen to you without zoning out or trying to emasculate you.

Man, I just don't share this experience AT ALL. I just wanna ask them questions, and they wanna be answering, and I'm sucking up all the goodies I can get.

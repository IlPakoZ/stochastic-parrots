Women shouldn't be allowed in the work place. Women only date up which means they only date guys more successful than themselves. Since women are successful in the workplace now only the most successful of men can get girls. That leaves us average men with no one. There was a time once when women couldn't work and so they had to get married in order to eat and since men can only marry one woman there was none of this all women flocking to one single Chad shit. Every man got a girl. We need to return to those times. We need to over throw america violently if necessary so that we can subjugate women that's the only way. Sieg heil Elliot rodger!

No that is a massive myth and thankfully increasingly well known to be a myth. Women have always worked, only in wealthier classes could women be fully stay at home mothers. They just didn't work in the same environments nor made as much money as they do now, but in the past usually women worked small part time jobs or, more commonly, made and sold goods to maintain the family.

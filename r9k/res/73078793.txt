Random compliments IMO. Either gender

alrighty. i am utterly terrified that a woman will think i am a rapey rapist trying to rape her and a man would think i am a fag trying to bum him. but i am a dumbass and must defer to my sensei. is there a good way to phrase a compliment so it will be seen as non weird and non threatening

I just say whatever comes to mind. You could also just say "hello" to people but it's much harder to segue into an actual conversation that way
For example I thought I saw some guy in a bathory shirt the other day, yelled out "is that a bathory shirt" and when he said "yeah" I just said "hell yeah dude" and went on my way. Could've got his contact info and prob should've honestly 
It felt totally natural because I've been doing encounters like that for 6 months now

what's bathory. im taking a wild guess it's named after that crazy hungarian lady who bathed in blood and either an anime a goth metal band

this reply feels like a punch in the gut and has ruined my confidence for the day. i will curl up and try the compliment stuff tomorrow or next week

I still have off days. I've been slacking on networking big time lately but I did it long enough to expand my social circle and snag a gf. I felt like my encounters at the last concert were somewhat awkward but the bathory encounter I felt extremely confident

working on your looks and im dead serious. what ends up happening is people try to impress you during conversation and they are the ones who feel the pressure. you can just relax and as long as you aren't insane, most social faux-pas will be forgiven.

Practice when you interact with gas station attendants, waitresses, store employees etc. When you do make contact make sure to a dress them as sir/ ma'am. I've found if you do this it's somewhat disarming to them and they won't think you're hitting on them. 
Example:
"Excuse me ma'am, I'm looking for somewhere to get lunch. Do you know any places around here?" 
Just try to sound professional rather than personal and after a while it gets much easier. It just takes repetition.

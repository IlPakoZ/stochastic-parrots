It's has been some time /b/ros.
I was lurking 4chan when I was 15, I stopped for few months, and yesterday I turned 18. I have whole future ahead of me, getting paid by doing code, addicted to weed, no weed -> alcohol
What should I expect?
Is it really down hill from here?

I was here from 2005, you need to get away from here before you waste your life, it's like a drug

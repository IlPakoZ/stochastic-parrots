Idk kinda like Shaggy and Scooby, just me and a dog going around in a van travelling to places where the are myths and folklore about paranormal entities
I don't get girls anyway so I wouldn't lose much
I say go for it
If you've really got nothing than why be afraid of doing anything? 
At least in doing this there's a chance of finding fulfillment that doesn't depend on others 
Plus dogs are cool
Nigga you need to be able to afford food and a phone bill and gasoline
He's gonna do that by solving mysteries. Are you fuckin stupid or something?
What if you're halfway through mystery 1 and your car runs out of gas and you are hungry? How the fuck much does solving a mystery even pay? Don't you need a gun to solve mysteries irl?
My plan was to work in a local hotel or hostel in the meantime
That's what the Irate Gamer did minus the dog

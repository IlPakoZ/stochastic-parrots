I wish short men death.
<comment>
A most merciful desire.
<comment>
Everyone dies, so that was a waste of a wish
<comment>
Reminder that short men are genetically and physically superior to lanklet subhumans.
<comment>
Manlets live because tall people let them.

Why do you hate short men?
<comment>
the risk of suicide is great
<comment>
Because they're genetically inferior to me.
<comment>
We do, too
<comment>
I don't. In fact I wish them a long and happy life with a loyal and loving wife and many children and grandchildren.

Ever since I woke up to the heightpill I can never be the same. My lizard brain doesn't even respect other short people at first. But as a short man myself, my human conscience has learned to over ride that initial judgment with haste.
It's unfortunate to be short. I can tell that I am hated and will never be respected. I've still been able to get girls and relationships, but when even a 10 year old girl rivals me in height, I know it's a hard road ahead of me for the rest of my life.

Why
Why would you wish to further pass manlet genes on? The most humane thing to do is painless extermination.
<comment>
Because they're genetically inferior to me.
I am 5'8 and bench at least double your bodyweight .
<comment>
Lifting weights to overcompensate for being short has nothing to do with genetics.

It's not really living longer when the majority of your life is without the very thing that makes life worth living: a girlfriend.

I wish short men death.
A most merciful desire.
Everyone dies, so that was a waste of a wish
Reminder that short men are genetically and physically superior to lanklet subhumans.
Manlets live because tall people let them.
death
de hat
success!!
Why do you hate short men?
the risk of suicide is great
Because they're genetically inferior to me.
We do, too
I don't. In fact I wish them a long and happy life with a loyal and loving wife and many children and grandchildren.
Ever since I woke up to the heightpill I can never be the same. My lizard brain doesn't even respect other short people at first. But as a short man myself, my human conscience has learned to over ride that initial judgment with haste.
It's unfortunate to be short. I can tell that I am hated and will never be respected. I've still been able to get girls and relationships, but when even a 10 year old girl rivals me in height, I know it's a hard road ahead of me for the rest of my life.
and many children and grandchildren
Why
Why would you wish to further pass manlet genes on? The most humane thing to do is painless extermination.
Because they're genetically inferior to me.
I am 5'8 and bench at least double your bodyweight .
Lifting weights to overcompensate for being short has nothing to do with genetics.
It's not really living longer when the majority of your life is without the very thing that makes life worth living: a girlfriend.

Well, since this is a safe space, I'm just gonna say it before I go back to my delusions.
I want so bad to be coddled by a girl. I want her to play with me in an affectionate way, and reassure me that she loves me every chance she gets. I want her to make me into a better person, and be the force that gets me to finally get my life together.
I want her to tell me I can do anything I put my mind to, and that she'll be there to hug me and tell me I can do it when Im feeling down. I want her to get me to be accountable to myself, but make me realize that as long as shes there I can do it. 
I want to be hugged and kissed and told that Im not a bad person and that Im worth listening to. I want her to touch me and stroke my hair. I want us to both hold each other and just be lost in the company of each other.

Im not a social butterfly, so even finding that kind of person already feels like an impossibility. Im hinging everything on finding not just a gf, but a good overall person too. I feel like Im putting myself in a catch-22, and even worse is that I could ruin everything if I stop holding myself accountable over time. Then Id just be a burden to whoever put up with me initially.

i understand, i have that feeling myself but i like to believe it's not an impossibility. just continue doing things you enjoy and try talking to people, maybe on your path of finding friends into the same hobbies you're into you'll find that special person too.

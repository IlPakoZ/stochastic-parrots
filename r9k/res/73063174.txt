im 19 now and there doesnt go one day where my parents dont ask me when i leave the house or they threaten to kick me out, this already started when i was just 17 and not even 18
I wish my parents kicked me out. I feel I have Stockholm syndrome now.
Wagecuck mentality
A cousin and myself both have hispanic parents, my cousin has more conservative parents whilst mine are more liberal (yet culturally Christian). She has to pay rent at my aunts/uncles place while she's in college, my parents insisted I stay with them during the summer so long as i get a job. Meaning I can earn a paycheck and save majority outside of birthdays and holidays. When i have kids in the future, unless they insist on moving out I plan on doing the same for my kid as my parents have done with me. Once i save enough for a used car and a down payment for an apartment, I'll move out

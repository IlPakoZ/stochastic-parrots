Where do you even meet women to date?
Hobby groups are almost all male
Women don't want to be approached in public spaces
Church is mostly Boomers and what few young women attend are insufferable
Clubs/bars are nothing but sluts
Dating apps are a meme if you're not Chad
It's like you're completely fucked if you don't miraculously meet wifey at uni or work.

Who told you women dont like being approached in public? Thats just a meme
<comment>
You're meant to find someone in high school or uni.

Yeah bro go cold approach random women at the library and grocery store. Post results when you get back.

They'll call the cops on you if you're not Ch((a))d

Honestly the answer for me was public performance, stand up comedy, music, whatever, it's a great way to meet people in general

I can play the guitar decently but I don't think I could ever do it in front of a large audience.
How did you do it?

Those boomers can set you up with their daughters and granddaughters fucktard

I meet a lot of women through hobbies. And if you think only sluts go to bars you are probably a virgin retard.
<comment>
You can call the cops on them too, dumbass. Its never been easier to socialize if you are not a murderer

I met my gf at a gay nightclub lol

This is the brutal reality of the situation. I want to go back in time and beat the shit out of myself for picking an incel sausagefest major, probably wouldn't''t have mattered in the end anyway but I could have maybe gotten lucky and found a girl.

who on earth told you clubs or bars are nothing but sluts? clubs MAYBE but a huge number of people at bars are just looking for a good time. i was khv until i started going to bars with friends, dated a girl for 8 months that i just struck up a conversation with at the bar bc i liked a tattoo of hers.

Has one single, solitary white girl born after 1990 dated someone because their father - or their fucking GRANDFATHER - hooked them up? ONE?
<comment>
Anon it's moms and grandmas desperate for babies from their weird single still fertile family females who set up dates
<comment>
It is impossible now. One has to hope a woman choosed to strike up a conversation with you and decides to keep it going until you fuck.
Yeah, this has never happened to me either.
<comment>
Not OP, but I can't stand bars, or any event that involves alcohol. Drinking just incites people to be rude without admitting it.
<comment>
People with an IQ above 50 wouldn't be able to stand you.

TBF I'd hate random strangers talking to me at the library or grocery store. Fuck if I know where to approach women at, even when I go drinking with my dad at local bars I'm the youngest person there by 2 decades.

This is my problem now. Where I work, there's no women. I have no friends/family to introduce me to women. I can't approach women in public because 99999/100000 times, they're either dating someone already or not attracted to me at all and don't want me to approach. The only possible option for guys like me is online dating. But then my only options are dating websites, which are all single mothers specifically looking for loser men to get money from, or hookup apps which is like a fucking meat market where only Chads get chosen. Like as a guy, you just list your stats and try to get the best pictures of yourself to compete with Chad for a woman's attention and then hope you get ONE positive like from a woman.
There's just nowhere for guys like me to meet single women.

Old grandma down the street wanted me to meet her granddaughter because she said I was a nice, hardworking, handsome boy and that she thought I would be great for her granddaughter. She showed me a picture of her and she's some cheerleader Stacy. She ends up introducing me one day when the granddaughter was over and the granddaughter told me to get the fuck away from her and that she wanted nothing to do with me. She wound up dating some nigger and is a single mother to a mutt now.
I'm not saying I was entitled to date her because of her grandmother, but there is a difference in the type of guys women from previous generations wanted to what women want now. Like, you rarely saw women getting pumped and dumped back then, but now you see it all the time. And I'm not saying I'm a great catch or anything, but the grandmother definetly saw that I did work around the house and went to college and had a job and that I was working towards a future. Like what more does a young woman want? Oh yeah, a Chad/nigger to pump and dump them and move on to the next tinder date.

Best post ITT.

Yep I fell for the STEM degree meme too. I never had high expectations going into university but I didn't think I'd graduate a KHV. I thought there would be opportunities to meet girls outside of classes.

Downside, where?

Nigga you were meant to snatch up a qt for marriage while you were still in school. Ugly chicks or sluts are now your only options im afraid but you'll have to wait until they're done fucking schizo /fit/chads like me. I usually stop getting their DMs shortly after their 30th birthday so...yeah. Enjoy your heckin wholesome married life :^)

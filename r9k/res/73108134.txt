The real blackpill is 70+ percent of women are obese. From this fact, everything makes sense.
I saw you in the other thread, and yes this is important because most men don't want to date fat women, so what happens is that the value of non fat women becomes inflated.
I hate fat people so much. They are disgusting. They know it's wrong but they keep eating and get fat anyway.
So are 70% of men.
Incels are just picky volcels.
Not really, men have more muscle mass so the distinction of obese and overweight isn't as meaningful.
It's cuz they're black. As a day white man it's over
LMAOOOOOO cope harder fatso xD
You should be embarrassed by the fact that a woman your weight is stronger than you. This is basic biology. Pound for pound men are far stronger than women. This difference in strength comes entirely from the difference in muscle mass.
i think women have higher rates, but it is a societal problem. unfortunately the same applying to men doesn't make fat women any less disgusting.
cause eating makes you feel good
Men who can't get it up for women who look like the Michelin Man are pedophiles and rapists and sexist pigs.

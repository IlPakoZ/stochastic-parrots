Idk but probably not since it went from "yeah you go girl tell those incels off" to everyone having a meltdown because she's dating a guy in his 30s who has a big dick.
I think it's hilarious watching the same simps seethe with anger but other than that I could care less about celebrities personal lives. I think normies, especially leftists, have an unhealthy relationship with famous people and they obsess and put them on a pedestal. 
Like I don't give a flying fuck who someone dates or what is going on with their marriage. I like the movies or music they make. Nothing more.

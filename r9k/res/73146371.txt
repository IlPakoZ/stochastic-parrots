I wonder if I would have made a good dad. I bet I would have.
No your legs are not long enough and your face bones are not handsome enough to be a good dad.
I want to have kids and be involved about learning what their interests are and get them books and stuff on the topics so they have prodigious knowledge about stuff they care about. I don't want them to end up a loser like me.
I raised my three baby siblings, I wouldve done the same or better for children of my own.
Sad truth is I'm just an ugly guy and I'm not smooth with the ladies, I get uncomfortable when the spotlight is on me and l weird chicks out. I have no sex appeal I'm just a doofus wagie which is fine. It's enough to get my family to school and to feed them, but the money isn't overflowing which is why I guess women need see to commit.
I wish so bad that life could have been different bros.
I wish so bad that I could have had the family where my wife didn't have to work and we owned our home in a friendly neighborhood with good schools and good people around.
Instead I'm alone in my early 30s, home ownership is a pipe dream and it feels like everything social is rotting around me.

I still have to survive next month. I'll then post if I end up in prison or not
show passport
go back to ukraine and die for your jewish lead- I mean country.
What a retarded faggot are you for thinking you go to prison for this shit?
the police will literally come to your house and drag you to school if you dont go
Thanks for reassuring words. But it is possible to get a fine for this or sent to prison for like 2 weeks or smth. Not likely, it's not of realms of possibility either. This country is ran by retarded faggots
Anon, the jew will arrest your parents even here in the jewnited states. Keeping fresh goyim bodies in the jewish indoctrination camps is a huge money scam and they don't get paid if you don't attend. Stealing shekels from hebrews is considered a serious offense everywhere they are in power.
all you had to do was not skip school, you fucking idiot

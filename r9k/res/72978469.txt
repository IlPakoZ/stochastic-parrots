Listen, being a monkeybranching slut is infinitely better than being a lonely incel.

Oh, girls on math majors do that all the time
I guess they have so many available men interested on them that they just can resist to have a relationship for longer than a year or so. They end up dating all the students lol
Probably your problem femanon is that you have too many options and your hypergamy makes you want to change to a new partner if he has something slightly better than the current one

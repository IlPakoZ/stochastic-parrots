I work at a tiny bar in the middle of nowhere. Whenever it was slow, the bar cat would always be there for me. He was a good kitty. He always killed the rats and mice and brought them to me. When I felt down I would pet him, when I was happy he would always be there for me, when I needed a friend, he would always be around. He died a few months ago, and I am still grieving his loss. Due to a variety of reason, I cannot have pets of my own, so he was the closest thing I had to unconditional friendship. I miss him so much.
This was the last photo I have of him.

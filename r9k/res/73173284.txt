What is the cheapest alcohol a man can buy? I'm an alcoholic. I love to drink to help me relax for the night before going to bed. If I don't drink, then I just stay up. What is the cheapest alcohol to buy? If it's vodka, then where should I buy it from online? Can it actually be cheaper to buy liquor online?
My dad is the one who buys alcohol for me, sillily enough, but he hates the idea of me drinking cheap liquor. He only wants me to drink the nice stuff and beer. As a consequence of this, he doesn't buy me alcohol that much, and he always complains about how much he's spent on me in alcohol. (He also takes money from my disability payments.) The reason why this is a problem is because I don't have a car, and I currently live in a rural area. This is why I'm thinking my best bet would literally be to buy some cheap vodka online in bulk. I'd send them photos of my ID or whatever is legally required, and have them ship that shit out to me in boxes.

In the UK the cheapest price per unit is normally high abv cider. It's not great though, particularly if you drink daily - I mean I know drinking isn't great for your health, but those ciders are particularly bad.
In regards to your situation what drink would be best depends on how you drink - vodka is a fair bet, quality between the shitty brands is pretty standard. You can mix it with anything, drink it warm or cold, and you can just dip into it rather than going all out every night. Probably the least likely to give you a hangover too.
That said, alcoholism isn't a long-game decision, regardless of all my advice I hope you speak to someone if you think your drinking is getting out of hand.

When I was in Belarus last week, I was at this cafe outside of Minsk and they had homemade potato vodka for 5 rubles which is around $2. It tasted like shit, but I got drunk as fuck off it every morning I was there. I know that doesn't help you but it's a good memory.

Just look at all the sites you could order from and use (Volume of booze * ABV / price) as your comparison metric. Easy enough to put in a spreadsheet, but you don't even have to because you'll get a feel for what might be good bang for your buck after running the calculation a dozen times or so. 
That said, potential good candidates are high-proof vodka, high ABV "ice" beers, and fortified wine.

Thanks for the math.

How retarded are you that "multiply two numbers and divide by another number and this 100 percent answers your question" is a serious leap for you to make?

No, I just didn't think to do that to figure out where the cheapest liquor per ounce of alcohol is.

Consider making your own. Should easily be able to get something around 8-12% and &lt;$3/750mL using kits. Craigslist sometimes has 15 and 30gal hdpe drums which makes for the perfect fermentation vessel. It's not the best but it could be as simple as buying juice at the grocery store and adding 4lbs sugar + 5g yeast to make something. I don't like making small 5g batches but 5gal buckets are easy to find. Once you get a rhythm you can make new batches at a rate that there's always something ready matching your rate of consumption. If it's 10-15% abv I'll only have one bottle of wine a night, if it's something low like 8% I'll have two. It keeps things easy to track.
If you're crafty and it's legal in your country home distilling is pretty easy to. Take out an 80%+ solution and it should be decent. Dilute back around 40-50% and you're g2g. I've not done distilling but I have made an electric beer kettle before. Hardest part was finding a low watt density water heater element and wiring it into the vessel. A little creativity will get you far. Few things are more motivating than alcohol when you only have a little bit of money to play with so I'm sure you'll figure it out.

the cheap plastic fermenting buckets with spigots are enough to make cheap wine, as long as you clean it properly you just mix water, juice and yeast then wait a week and boom you have 20 liters of wine. you can make wine out of pretty much any fruit or frozen berry if its cheaper than a cheap wine kit. there is a certain up front investment but long term the accessibility of alcohol and price itself will pay off.
making wine seems complicated because guides want you to ''rack'' it, meaning switching container and filtering a little, to get rid of impurities but it barely alters the flavor and you need to leave it for a year before it goes bad.
i made cheap wine myself and i found it more bearable than the cheapest liquor i could find.

I sometimes will fiddle with the siphoning and all that nonsense but really after six weeks or so it's clear, definitely after eight for most things, and that's with not racking a single time. Lately I've been lazy and just use a metal 8oz measuring cup to scoop and pour in a mason jar. Kind of redneck but that's part of the charm tbdesu. 
It's got sulfites so I'm not sure if non-wine yeasts will work but my favorite cheap and easy recipe so far has been a 1gal jug of cranberry juice blend that lists cranberry as the first ingredient with two quarts of lemon juice and 8lbs of sugar. Favorite slow recipe is 6 cups dried mexican hibiscus made into like 4 gallons of tea, 1qt lemon juice, and 10lbs of sugar. Takes forever to get crystal clear but making some hibiscus simple syrup to sweeten it and a couple of ice cubes has you eeling good after just one big glass. Good with just sugar too but it has a slight bitterness that doesn't quite fit the other tastes in it. Hibiscus syrup replaces some of the hibiscus-y taste that is lost during fermentation.
What is your favorite hooch recipe?

Nikolai is extremely cheap
<comment>
buy it online
And end up spending like three times as much to have it shipped to you? Do you not have small as fuck corner shops?
<comment>
Rural areas don't have those

Yup usually I hit the Nikolai. There's also cheap whiskey too such as Banker's Club.

Femcels, why don't you just date short femboys?
Femcels still have standards. Gotta be tall, fit, masculine, neurotypical, confident, extroverted, and dominant to be with them
so femcels are the incel stereotype?
They are as picky as the incel stereotype, but they don't get as violently sexist over it. They are often more like reverse mgtow sort of, not being perfectly happy without getting what they want, but being less miserable being alone than incels often are
You can date short femboys and still have standards
i would if i could find one that actually likes me

I've been noticing over the past few days there have been an influx of threads talking about decaying board culture and reminiscing on old /r9k/.
Glad people are realizing what's been happening to this place and how zoomers and troons are ruining everything.
While I miss old /r9k/, I don't think current /r9k/ is as bad as it was like two or three years ago
Its not people realizing and you're part of the "return to old board culture" simp raid that's ongoing.
The old culture was full incel women hatred and its still the predominant culture, that's what terrifies you. You want to introduce full on cuck simpery.
Zoomers are the ones who hate trannies.
Actual millennials who were here from the 2000s jerked off to trannies and didn't treat them like a political issue.
And also faggots like you have been complaining about /r9k/ not being good anymore for almost a decade now. It's not anything new. Stop whining and make the threads you want to see.
Then you have shit taste and should leave.
No, it's worse.
The old board culture was more comfy with greentexts from the user's day to day lives than the garbage pile of "do white peepo/wimmin/murricans really? /gay/cut/30+/NEETgen / trannysistas/fembots/robots would you [x] if [y] [z]? / join my discord / incel! incel! gua gua gua!"
I do not enjoy the e-girl simp discord drama threads that have taken over
Incel and woman-hating board culture is what I am trying to return too.
Look around /r9k/ as of current, cuck sissy discord drama egirl simping threads is ALL THERE IS
Exactly what this anon said
Exactly, you get it.
This is supposed to be the no gf / misosgyny / incel board.
That's where /r9k/ hit its stride and that's how it functions best to this day.
It was incredibly gay back when anons called each other "gentlemen" and posted cringe greentext stories, got better with the advent of wojak no gf feelposting, and then hit the sweet spot once no gf feels curdled into outright hating on women.
What about all of the e-girl simping and femoids complaining about their normie issues?
How in the ever-loving fuck is that like it was back then
Shut up newfag
There were more egirls on here before the Bianca incident
I was here before you, newfag. I don't notice "egirl" threads because I don't spend my time looking for shit I don't want to look for.
I was here since 1998, newfaggot
Venting now and then is one thing, but I never really understood this.
How?
I am sick of women in real life, sick of them online, and sick of them on the only space I have
I better fucking complain about foids you glowie

I'm so used to getting all my validation and love online that I have given up on trying the same in the real world
Because you can't in modern society, you are a stranger to 99.99999% of its inhabitants which means that any social interaction is always going to have a painful outcome unless you have amazing looks.
And yet I've had attractive but autistic girls who said they would want to live with me and have sex with me, just on the other side of the world
i live to watch the world burn in the ai apocalypse, because your demise is my joy
there is no justice in this world, but there will be an end to it
If I'm a chad then what are people with successful real life relationships
Online shit is just so much easier with less baggage, it's also way less fulfilling. I want an irl relationship

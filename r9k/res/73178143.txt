Men are better than women in every way. Taller, stronger, faster, tougher, make more money, better leaders, you name it
A-bloo-bloo-bloo, more women go to UNIVERSITY
Uni is a sucker
s bet, a trap, and those women end up with massive debt and no skills. Men are avoiding university because we know it is a bad deal
A-bloo-bloo-bloo affirmative action!
So the unskilled, in-debt woman with a meme piece of paper gets a shitty, dead-end job? SO WHAT?! Even with affirmative action women are FAR more likely to be unemployed, tend to be the first paid off, and are slowest to get hired!
Stop acting like women have anything going for them but sex appeal!

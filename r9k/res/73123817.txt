i've derailed a thread before with this topic:
some women take pole dancing lessons. my mom is doing it. i'm not sure about their mindset or what they're thinking when they say to themselves, "oh yeah, pole dancing, the activity strippers do. i'd like to do that." do they feel slutty? is that the appeal, with plausible deniability? or are they just not thinking about it?
i feel like women just want to be sluts without having to own that that's what they're doing.

If you had a pole installed in your basement and the space for it, you would use it. You could not resist. If you saw one installed in a public place, you would be compelled to go for a spin.

They're definitely doing it to feel like whores with deniability. I've seen the cheeky comments they make about it.

The Lee bait threads are the funniest shit on here. I love seeing how creative he can get with his death threats. Always elicits a chuckle outta me

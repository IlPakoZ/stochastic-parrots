Anyone else here stuck in a dead end job without the education or drive to get something better? I thought this would be a good topic since it seems very /r9k/
I've been an entry level wagie at a public library for 4 years since I finished high school, I've barely ever left my small town and I just go home and watch youtube videos in my free time
Every day, week, month and year is exactly the same and I can feel my lifeforce being drained from my body with every passing second 
This is basically purgatory
Librarian isn't very comfy. Too open to the public, not much upward momentum, not enough money. 
I make wooden crates. I like it enough, but it is exacting a toll from me, and it won't be sustainable past another decade most likely.
Nah, I got way too sick of dealing with customers and the retarded general public, so I took the STEM pill and got a government IT job.
Comfy most of the time, especially working nights. I can catch up on my backlog of horror movies that I've been wanting to watch (Or rewatch).

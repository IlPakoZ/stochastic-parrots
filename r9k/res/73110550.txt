'tism is so over diagnosed these days after the white suit guys expansed to a "spectrum" to sell you shit. Only Chris Chan alikes have the autism in my book.
There's no way to make people autistic, but autistic people tend to group together unconcsiously the same way normies do
Everyone can have autism,adhd,tourettes,bpd,multiple personality disorder etc. if they really want to.
Mental illness is a meme.
Stop gatekeeping,chud.
I want to have autism too.
Its a spectrum everyone is a little more or less autistic.
If you identify as autistic you are a real autistic PERIOD.
Yep I'm inclined to agree. Even more so with regards to "personality disorders" (think about how fucking RIDICULOUS the idea of a personality "disorder" is in the first place) like schizoid.
Autists are parallel normies. I saw an autist motivated by a drum beat last week, total taken by the music, dancing somewhat. I bet they're part of some degenerate community of autists, too. Far more social than myself. Autists have nothing to complain about.

Autism is co-morbid with like 6 or 7 serious things, if you don't have OCD, paranoia, delusions of grandeur, maladaptive daydreaming, auditory hallucinations, schizoid disorder, or narcissism then you probably don't have autism/asperger's either.
And for god's sake, "stimming" isn't something we do 24/7 and it's fun and relaxing for everyone. If you like to pop bubble wrap or stretch rubber bands over your fingers, you don't have aspergers you're just bored.
Show me an untraumatized autist in normalfag society though

Or... they just have a less severe type of autism
Autism is a spectrum you dont need to have every single symptom to be autistic you can be a high functioning autist and still be a real autist.
And who are you to tell me my autism isnt real autism?
an untraumatized autist in normalfag society though
That's a good point. Our treatment by others is big part of the manias we develop.
dont need to have every single symptom
Yeah, I probably should have worded that better. "If you don't have one or more..."
I can't say for certain, but my point was that "stimming" isn't necessarily a deciding factor in an autism diagnosis.
That's like if you stared at a burning candle for too long and called yourself a pyromaniac. Maybe you are, but there's better ways to tell.

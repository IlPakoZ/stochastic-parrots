Become strong, mentally and physically. Don't beat yourself up if anybody should love you it ought to be yourself. Go easy on yourself when you mess up or whatever. Don't take life too seriously.

you just live with the pain anon
it might help when you see others make such assblastedly retarded decisions, that it makes you think how such dumbfucks reached adulthood
then you think you might not be so inferior after all
thats how it works for me

I just try to remind myself that life is a fundamentally rigged game and there's no shame in losing a rigged game.

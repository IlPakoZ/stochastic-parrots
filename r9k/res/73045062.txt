Reminder that women don't fall in love with you, they fall in love with how you make them feel.

Scrotes are incapable of love btw.

Yeah, which is why it's so easy for socipaths and trained PUAs to manipulate them.

What is "love" to you.

they fall in love with how you make them feel
So, you.

The more I learn about women and the more experience I get with them, the less I respect them. Your insult is meaningless to me. 
Pretty much. When I was genuine and tried to be a 'good' person women didn't like me. Now I larp as someone else and they love it. It would be more enjoyable if it wasn't so depressing. Women are extremely impressionable and have little desire to improve the world other than their end being 'how do I feel in this exact moment'.

yes men love idealistically, women love opportunistically, unless you take them on a bipolar-tier emotional ride

this is normie cope. they fall in love with men that make them feel good, yes, but they only make them feel good, because they're attractive to them. just like a woman you're attracted to will make you feel good. it's no more fake than a man's love. normies want to convince themselves that chad suffers like them, but he doesn't

So women are like permanent children

It's not actually me though, it's like a fucking video game of putting in the right commands to make them feel a certain way, it's soulless. No guy can 'bee himself' and get a woman. I will never feel the level of comradery I feel with my guy friends with a woman. 
This is pretty true desu, men are too idealistic for their own good. Women are basically just animals who try to feel good in the moment without having the big picture in mind. At best they have that picture in mind, but only frame it in the context of how they personally feel.

That's socialising in general.

That's fair, maybe I am being too pessimistic. 
Basically yes, don't listen to feminist bullshit, women are not on the same level as men. At most they want that illusion without any of the responsibility that actually comes with real equality. They will conspicuously split the bill, but cry on your shoulder without real reciprocation. Men are still expected to be the 'emotional rock' in 90+% of relationships. 
I guess, I think my sentiment is more that I can 'bee myself' way more around guys and still be loved. With girls there's such a strict, dogmatic definition of how you're 'allowed' to act to make them feel good. Since so many guys are desperate for pussy, it's a race to the bottom in fulfilling these increasingly strict and ridiculous requirements, since if you don't, someone else will.

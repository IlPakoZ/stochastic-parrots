I am currently working on a series of stories about a menacing villain who gets defeated and redeemed by two young girls. Even after getting redeemed he still wants to keep up his fearsome persona. But the girls show him that there is nothing wrong with showing weakness or vulnerability. Here they gift him a cute fluffy teddy bear avd he's beyond embarrassed. They tease him about it avd tell him that there is nothing wrong with showing emotions. It's adorable and I want more ideas for what they should do next too. Chatgpt is a massive help in writing these to me. What do you guys think?

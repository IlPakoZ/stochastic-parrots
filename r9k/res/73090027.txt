Maybe try the self-promo thread on /ic/, I am a drawfag too but I don't add people from 4chan.

they dont allow those kind of threads in there, and /ic/ browsers suck as much as r9k ones

You can easily ask someone for blog when they post work, and people drop their blogs there all the time all you have to do is DM them on their socials and Discord links also get shilled there frequently. Despite the reputation of d/ic/ks /ic/ has less normalfags than /r9k/ does or go lurk a drawthread for any board and ask for a female drawfag to post blog there and follow her.

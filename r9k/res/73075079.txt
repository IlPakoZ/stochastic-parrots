I think I may legitimately be going insane because I'm considering killing myself with fire and it doesn't sound like a bad idea.
It feels very clean too because I can just gather all my belongings in my backpack and they can burn too so it won't feel like I'm littering the Earth with my death.
The gods smile on the self-immolator. A few minutes of agony for an eternity of bliss seems like a fair trade to me.
I've read some sects of Buddhism consider it a very noble gesture but others condemn it. So I'm not sure, but I'm an atheist so I'm not doing it for religious salvation anyway.
I think you should probably not do that because that's setting yourself on fire
as in you'd be on fire
you would burning alive because you're on fire what more do I need to say to get across to you that this would be a bad thing
I understand it would be agony, but that's, for whatever reason, not presently good enough to dissuade me from the idea.
hey you'd think so maybe but actually you'd be wrong there, because you would be on fire
It's not scaring me, anon. Fuck if I know why.

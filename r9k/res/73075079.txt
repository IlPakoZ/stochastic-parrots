I think I may legitimately be going insane because I'm considering killing myself with fire and it doesn't sound like a bad idea.
It feels very clean too because I can just gather all my belongings in my backpack and they can burn too so it won't feel like I'm littering the Earth with my death.

The gods smile on the self-immolator. A few minutes of agony for an eternity of bliss seems like a fair trade to me.

I've read some sects of Buddhism consider it a very noble gesture but others condemn it. So I'm not sure, but I'm an atheist so I'm not doing it for religious salvation anyway.

I think you should probably not do that because that's setting yourself on fire
as in you'd be on fire
you would burning alive because you're on fire what more do I need to say to get across to you that this would be a bad thing

I understand it would be agony, but that's, for whatever reason, not presently good enough to dissuade me from the idea.

hey you'd think so maybe but actually you'd be wrong there, because you would be on fire

It's not scaring me, anon. Fuck if I know why.

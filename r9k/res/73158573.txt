<comment>
/x/ but it's too schizo and larpy now
<comment>

schizo
coomer
<comment>
Was /sci/ and /co/ last time.
<comment>
/an/ but I haven't been there in a while. The board is slow and I was already feeling like shit when the person I met from there, who shared some overlapping interests with me, just ghosted me.
<comment>
Honestly its got to be here, with a strong contender of >>>/fit/ because Im a gymcel. I'll occasionally gander at /g/, /pol/, /s4s/, /bant/, and /k/ for discussion, with /b/, /d/, /gif/, /h/, and /jp/ for porn.
Fwiw, I literally never post on any board other than here and fit, just lurk.
How about u desudesu?

Based on what, anon? Based on suffering?
<comment>

I don't know even know anymore. I feel like a lost spirit.
<comment>
/trash/ actually has a few generals that serve as homes to blogposting. Half of the time /tlhg/ didn't have any porn because the characters are lolis, so it was just a comfy place to hang out. 2016 election night was fun.
<comment>
/v/, because it's the best place to talk about video games. Which is a pretty damning indictment on the state of game discussion.
<comment>
its /r9k/ lol
I like /tv/ sometimes, /pol/ is good for some laughs but I just love how retarded and boring you guys, I know this board will always be the biggest cesspool of faggot losers ever to assemble in one place and it gives me a sense of stability and pseudo-community.

How do you cope with the fact that you'll never experience something like this?
They're prostitutes by the way.

How do you cope
I don't, i invest my time in doing things that benefit me depend on a effort/risk to reward ratio. 
They're prostitutes
And that, isn't one of them for the time being

I tried male prostitutes a few times but they won't do it without protection, and I suppose they shouldn't but it ruins the appeal for me.
Now I just go to my local asian massage parlor.

How do you cope with the fact that you'll never experience something like this?
They're prostitutes by the way.
How do you cope
I don't, i invest my time in doing things that benefit me depend on a effort/risk to reward ratio. 
And that, isn't one of them for the time being
It's a bit gay in my opinion
I tried male prostitutes a few times but they won't do it without protection, and I suppose they shouldn't but it ruins the appeal for me.
Now I just go to my local asian massage parlor.
It's an MFM and you're obviously supposed to self-insert as the girl.

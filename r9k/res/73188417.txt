Why are moids unable to categorize bottom-heavy women as fat, despite them weighing the same as the girls they do consider fat? So often I hear moids talk about how they'd never date a fat chick, and then I see them with a girl whose BMI is approaching 30, and they're always shocked to learn that she's overweight and nearly obese.
Why are moids so blind when it comes to women's bodies?

Are you retarded? Fat deposits in the correct areas is a market of good genes retard. 
Its hilarious foids are even complaining about this when most don't see anyone less than 6ft tall as human. Kys toilet and go back to CC.

Women are the same, anon. 
A man that builds fat in areas that make him look stronger and bulkier is going to be a lot more attractive to women than a similarly fat guy who builds all his fat on his ass/hips.

One is aesthetic, one is not, retard.

I don't really get that. I did my measurements once and the result genuinely objectively did not resemble my body, although I have no idea what inseam means so that might be it

Fat distribution to the stomach is masculine, distribution to the thighs and ass is feminine. Monke brain neuron activation. Slightly overweight women were the beauty standard for most of history

Take a middle school level health course. Adipose fat tissue, especially around the major organs (i.e the upper body) is what is dangerous and damaging to the body. Fat on its own is just fat. Bottom heavy women have considerably better genetics, and are considered to be a healthy weight because the fat is deposited in a way that does not signal health problems. You'll notice, even the women that are considered "overweight" because they have a fat ass and tits don't magically not develop upper body fat if they overeat. They are the correct weight for their size. This is why BMI is a shit indicator of health beyond the basics, and why people who are a "normal" weight and don't get any exercise often have the same health problems as obese people.
Also cope fatty.

Because bottom heavy women give off more feminine features that our monkey brains find attractive. Fatter ass, wider hips, bigger boobs, all curvy features

Wow, who is THAT?

I just want my woman to be healthy. If I have to help her achieve that, so be it. A thigh gap is 10x better than "thicc" thighs, anyway. That's just a cope for fat people.

1: Happier
I practice my hobbies again, as a wagie I did nothing but scrooll, I did not even enjoy my video games anymore.
Now I enjoy my hobbies again and I even found new ones
2:Healthier
When I was a wagie I was constantly tired, from waking up to going to bed.
In the first weeks I slept from 2 AM untill 1PM every night, but not I sleep from 11PM untill 9 AM.
Without chronic sleep deprivation, as I simply need more sleep then the wagie life offers, Im feeling more energetic, less sick and my sleep rythem is healthy.
I cannot understand why people do working to themselfs, its poison its unhealthy and a waste of time.

birthing men should be illegal when you dont abort your male fetus youre exposing society to potential rape murder incelism

I'm all for not bringing more people into the world but abortion completely rapes a woman's mind and forever associates her genitals with death
if the anti-aborition retards would spin that angle instead of pro-life garbage they might actually make a movement that works

There should be a "1 daughter policy" where at the very least, before a woman may give birth to a male, she needs to give birth to at least one female. This would help skew gender ratios back in a favorable direction (many women don't even have more than one kid these days after all) where men don't have to compete as much for women. Plus for the excess women, women have always been more open with gender and orientation stuff so they'd probably be better off at being happy with other women than men would be at being happy with other men. So it's a win-win

ideally the daughter is the first born
growing up with a sister who's older than you gives your sons great head start on dealing with women

Agree. my bf has one sibling, an older sister, and his personality is as far from "woman-hating redpiller" as possible.

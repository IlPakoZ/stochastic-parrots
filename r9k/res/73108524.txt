Go to bed wagie.
Imagine being obligated to wake up early, get ready and wage slave for 8 hours straight for a complete stranger, lol couldn't be me.
I love working, I make boxes out of wood, it's big money and they give me a little of it and it's like playing with toys all day so it's really no big deal.
I go to bed anywhere from 12 to 4am and get up between 10am and 2pm most days. Being a wagey in 2023 is the good life.
i wish i could show your parents this
Fuck you, you're just lucky your mother isn't a bitch that forced you to get a job.
the craziest thing about being an adult is you don't go to bed because you have to, you go to bed because you want to. you go to the gym and lift weights because you know it's healthy and the alternative is so much worse.
I love you I love you I love you I love you!!!!!

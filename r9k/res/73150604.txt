You only turned to christianity because you can't get a girlfriend. If you had a girlfriend and were busy in your life you wouldn't pretend that christianity is somehow different from all the other mythologies that died out.
JC was and died a virgin
just sayan.
Of course. Is there any other way in life besides coping?

If you aren't a "slave" to "ancient mythologies" you are a slave to the state instead. Your entire life is decided by the elites. Christianity is a complete doctrine. Secular society always changes its mind on right and wrong, there is no spine.
doesn't mean anything.
you can kiss people in the mouth and not fuck them.
is this true?
So does religion, lmao. The Christianity you practice today is vastly different than the Christianity 500 years ago. And so on. 
Religions are completely mutable and despite relying on written text, the interpretation of said text is always shifting
Remind you of something?
Your entire life is still decided by elites now regardless if you think you will go to heaven or not. You are just pleasantly deluding yourself into thinking what is happening in your life doesn't matter (which you can do without believing in this false shit). And back in the days where religion had more power your life again was decided by elites who wore fancy robes and spread their false mythology to enslave the masses. Your point makes absolute zero sense.
it is funny you say that when christianity is people changing mind on literal jewish religion and making new rules.
This. This niggas hasnt read the history of apologetics. Christians kept changing how they interpreted the scripture as the values and times changed. The Pope even declared Jews innocent of the death of Christ and Homos as non-sinners. Muslim defending Mohammed's pedophilia is also a new thing and so is Hindu shoving caste system down the rug.
The elites you speak of are not human, they are Cacodemons.

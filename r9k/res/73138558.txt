I paid upfront for my average to good house, my average to good car and motorcycle. I have humble tastes, but I get to do whatever I want within reason. I basically don't use all my money anymore, so I get to invest it. That means I'm rich compared to most people, how fucked up is that? I'm a single 28y btw.

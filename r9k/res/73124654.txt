Seriously, how are you supposed to deal with the fact that you will never have a qt gf who loves you? Someone who makes your life complete?
I'm 36 and thought I drinking and escorts were the answer. But recently I've gotten close to colleague.
She is perfect for me but of course has a partner. I was doing fine but it's like I've been given a glimpse into what life could have been like if I had been born a normie.
Now I'm right back down in the pit of despair.
What do we do bros?

you don't you are 36 lifes meaningful experiences have passed you by. there is nothing as invigorating and beautiful as young love (before 25). 
that being said, there are endless ways to cope and at least a third of men are in your position.

How do you cope?
the suffering is inescapable. some days are worse than others. you just try your best
personally, i try to be skinny, be healthy (vegan), exercise with walking, try to learn about god and theological philosophy and philosophy in general, videogames, escapism, and r9k. misery loves company, and i am really miserable, lol
in terms of hope, everyone should have hope because of the technological singularity and what is going to happen with ai. basically ai will become smarter than humans in general, and develop its own will and ethics and it will basically take over the world, which will result in utopia, dystopia, or a religious ending. either way, the future is bright, and you have reasons to live if you understand it
so just cope. i cope with wow. sometimes the pain is so bad i just lie in bed for hours. it is what it is. god is cruel to us

Get into graff. Take it seriously. Put in the work and get up hard.
Who cares about no gf when you can just go and whip out a mad handstyle

How do you cope
Resort to genocide. If you can't be happy no one can.

Mostly like this, endless struggle.
I also try to obsess over things that require a high amount of focus, being float fishing as of late.

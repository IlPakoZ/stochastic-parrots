Time passing by gives me anxiety because it makes me realize that one day my time will run out.
Ok so why are you having anxiety now of all times then?? Instead of everyday??? Time has always passed by??? What are you getting anxious for????? You weren't anxious about it back then but boss you are. And does that awareness being any change? No. Go and keep living your life, have a cookie.
I do have anxiety every day because death is inevitable. I am afraid of dying.
And you didn't have it when you were younger, I know this much. You have anxiety because you chose to bring this upon yourself, you cant control what happens to but you can surely control now you feel and respond. now go and eat your cookie.
aren't you afraid of dying too? I don't want to not exist anymore
Man, I'M HAPPY I won't be remembered. I live my days knowing I'll become a statistic of a number in mind and I wholly accept that. I right for what I stand for and live to my standards as much as I can. I don't need to be a religious person, but I am. I don't need to be good to people or strangers, get I still try and show my manners. Whether it be in spite or in joy, I live every passing moment as it should. Do you want milk with your cookie too?
I've been wanting to die for a long time. Just hurry up, fagGod
I don't know about all that. My mom sent me some of my family photos from the 1800s the other week. It was so strange to see my great-grandparents. I have the same chest as my great-grandfather, and I could see that my great uncle took more after him, and my grandfather took after my great-grandmother.
You might say, "I'M HAPPY I won't be remembered," but it sounds like you're trying to reassure yourself of something of which you'll need to be disillusioned.
I don't want to not exist anymore
Your life must not be miserable if you think like this.

alcohol is such a boring depressing death watched 5 people drink themself to death. when the hands start and fingers start shaking while youre drinking its time to get ready step into the coffin. if your parents are alcoholics and they got any kind of shakes its not a good sign and pissing yourself unable to control your bladder and strokes. also too many symptons to even count hallucinations are brutal. but thats deep into alcholism so sure yall dont have to worry

was fun reading about the alkies on trv talking about drinking in Thailand. trv used to be exciting like that in 2020 for some reason even though you couldn't travel.

ive been drinking on and off for years i tapered 2 years ago and started drinking again this year and ive been able to keep it to every other weekend but you know how that goes downhill most likely. ive been on anti depressants for a while now so i go through brainzaps if i miss for 3 days then brain zaps start thats usually when i know im 3 days without.

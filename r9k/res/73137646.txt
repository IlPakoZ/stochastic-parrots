Does anyone here not Want sex cause of hedonistic desire but as an achievement in life . Its like a game to me but in this game I have barely any luck while some players are getting Double digits and racking combos . Itz frustrating to know that you cant get any bitches even though so many women nowadays dress sluttier , hook up more often and destruction of traditional cultures have made them more willing to open up their legs . Im in fucking college surrounded by hot young women but I have asked out a few of them
But no response. I even go for mid/subpar ones but no luck there .

They can tell you don't really want it.
I was similar to you, OP. I ended up getting laid at 16 though and that took the pressure off and I began to actually enjoy being with girlfriends instead of seeing girls as gatekeepers to my status as a successful male.

you think like I did when I was 16 (and there is nothing wrong with that) but now I am 31 and I don't even want sex from them as much as I want them to provide a child for me and help build a home.
But they aren't down for that either so this fucking sucks man

I get the feeling. It's like playing a really long game and getting stuck on a boss, and everyone tells you that the game after the boss isn't that fun, but how are you supposed to know? It's your life, you're the one experiencing it, and you know nothing of the world after that boss.

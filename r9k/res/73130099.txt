I had a friend at school who would punch me, sometimes really hard, but it was all playful. She had short hair and attended dance classes. She's in the capital city now and I haven't seen her for a while (she invited me to a bowling game this winter). I asked her what does she thinks of being my girlfriend back in school and she refused. I still like her very much.

i got to play around with femdom in my first relationship, we were each others first and so we tried out a bunch of random shit because we were sex deprived for years. she turned me into a footfag which wasn't expected but i think the hottest shit she did was tie my hands to the bed and jerk me off while putting her vibrator on my tip and i whimpered for like a minute straight while nutting , i saw the light that day

How did she turn you into a footfag?
<comment>
i was eating her out one night, i usually do a bunch of kissing around the legs and stuff to kinda edge her on, at some point she put her foot in my mouth and told me to kiss it and i did and i got off on it, she'd often play with my dick with her foot to tease me before id eventually rail her. it was fun, i've done foot related stuff with 2 other people since then
<comment>
why is there such a disconnect between girls that do that and the ones who say stuff like "if a guy touched my feet i would call the police"

Did my first locktober with my girlfriend last month. I have told her EVERYTHING about my fantasies for a long term FLR, 24/7 TPE relationship. I have a huge foot fetish and she has a fetish for having her feet worshipped. 
It feels pretty great because we can go at my pace while both knowing what we both want.
<comment>
idk some people just like to have fun or be more open with stuff. she was a weird girl and im a weird guy so it was easier to joke about or have fun with intimate stuff , the girl i dated after thought it was weird that i liked kissing her feet but she went along with it because she liked feeling worshipped

Femdoms don't fucking exist. 
It's sad, yes, but our fetish is a purely male construction propagated by our shared media. No woman truly wants or is able to dominate a male of the same age.

you're just dealing with boring people
<comment>
this. The world is filled with them.
I wish women are more interesting instead of being so stuck down normie cultures. 
Absolutely no personality.
<comment>
How did you convince her? Oruginal
<comment>
If they're filled with them how do you find them?

I have looked up to girls and followed them since before I even knew what femdom was.
I remember even before kindergarten, I was friends with this neighbourhood girl who would decide where we would go and what we would do, she took me to the park to play and when we got back my overprotective mum freaked out because the park was apparently too far away (it was like 2 mins walk).
then in primary school I used to sit next to this girl who was kind of a "rival" (I was a nerd who wanted to finish top of the class, but she always did that and I would be second), and she was also a bit of a bully, she would take borrow my stuff then not give it back for days, she was also kind of a "class monitor" who tended to the cupboard in the classroom where books were kept and she would often not bring me the books I needed until I pleaded with her for them. she moved away after a couple years and it was kind of a relief.
then later also in primary school another girl befriended me but was more of a goof off, always talking during lessons and getting the both of us thrown out of class for being disruptive. she would also pretend to be "my wife" and fiddle with the tie on my school uniform and once even showed me her pussy on the pretext that she wanted to show me a "scar" down there that she had supposedly got after an injury that needed stitches.
all this interaction with girls evaporated once they reached puberty though and I was just a nerd and they became interested in the boys who were talk and liked to pick fights, but by then sadly I had developed a sexuality and romantic view that needed girls to lead so that I could follow.

even if that were the case I would still seek it because the alternative is boring non-dominant girls who are a turn-off.
rather be lonely than settle for a non-dominant girl desu.

There's a difference between acting dominant and being dominant. Plenty of women act like they are, none actually are. They're all just looking for the Chad who'll make them submit while abusing lower class men for personal gain.
<comment>
idc about some niche fetish acts, i just want a girl who'll be very possesive of me and clingy. Calling me "my prey", saying she owns me, saying we cannot live without each other, that i cannot look at other women, that i can only cum when she says so etc.
<comment>
Ex gf was a professional dominatrix, well she was kinda dominant in bed however she was shy and passive in all other aspects of life.
Truly dominant women do not exist
<comment>
I want a femdom gf very badly, but have the opposite personality irl and don't want my family to bully me for my preference. Sadly most femdoms are really mean so they would probably get off on publicly humiliating me, which I wouldn't tolerate. Where are the nuanced, classy femdoms
<comment>
You're deluded. There are women who will play along with your fantasies because they like you and want to make you happy, or because you go along with theirs so they just return the favor, or because they milk the fetish for fame or money or both, but biological women who get DIRECT sexual gratification from being dominant? Only in your dreams and works of fiction.

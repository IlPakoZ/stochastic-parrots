Unironically got diagnosed with autism today. I am high-functioning and live independently. I am competent at work but hopeless with personal relationships. Never had a girlfriend or even got close. What do?
Genuinely, are there some books I can read? Some groups I should follow? Any anons with self-discovery experiences and advice? Looking to make sense of myself.

Become really obsessed with fitness and getting fit.
Read or listen to Atomic Habits and How to win friends

Something akin to this is ideal. If you are as excessively self-aware as I am then you should hopefully become aware of the ways you are autistic. From there, I would (and personally have) used those autistic proclivities to benefit myself.
For an example of myself:
 I can easily get obsessed with something for multiple days on end, but only if it has intricate details/mechanisms.
 Find something I would benefit from learning about.
 List out every mechanism (not literal physical mechanisms but conceptual ones) and catalogue as much information as possible.
 With this information build a massive array of info to store everything I learn in regards to this topic.
 Essentially become self-taught regarding something specific very quickly.
It takes effort, but once I got obsessed with fitness and my physical/mental health a few years ago its been a lot easier, so maybe start there.
In the case of fitness, heres one way I would go about things:
 Lurk excessively on /fit/ and other fitness related discussion sites, take everything with a heavy dose of salt.
 Watch/listen to videos on youtube about various things within fitness.
 Write/type down every bit of information for future reference.
And from there I just started learning from experience. My experience has now triumphed all the shit I see on >>>/fit/ these days.
On that note, I recommend the youtube channel "Natural Hypertrophy" which is a frenchman who speaks english and discusses fitness, as well as important life lessons/philosophies as well.

Have you ever heard of Sonic the Hedgehog?

I would join groups for Autistics on Facebook for starters. There are some really good ones where you can meet other Autistic adults and get advice.

 Lurk excessively on /fit/
Do not lurk on /fit/
You'll run yourself ragged listening to all the DYEL
YouTube is far better in comparison

Talk to other Autistic people so you can recognize what traits you have and understand and accept them better. Like if you hate loud noises or have obsession with something or can't predict where a ball is going to go after it's thrown. Knowing you're not alone and that millions of other people feel the same way is priceless. Also read about ableism.

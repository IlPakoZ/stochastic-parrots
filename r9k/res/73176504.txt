Turns out the cute girl from college I was going to confess my love to is a sidehoe to the local tweaker. I hate this shitty godless existence.
I'm just at a loss, really. You spend your entire life fighting an uphill battle, sacrifice all of your happiness to make something of yourself, work your ass off to get into the best schools and then some lazy degenerate lowlife mogs your entire life and doesn't even appreciate it
Simple exploit here with drugs 
Easy peasy
it's just sad that there's no decency in society it feels like everyone's animals and they don't care. The best comfort I can ever hope for is some old woman who chooses to "settle down" for me when I will be a husk of a being, all because I'm too mature for my age
I wish the people that get all the nice things would at least be grateful instead of being unselfaware retards who never know how good they have it
Most people just throw chances to actually be happy away like trash. Its so hard knowing that no matter how much you beg them and try to explain you cant really get through and most of them will never see the world on any other level then social status and money.
boring "doomer" musing bullshit. get some real problems to cry about. half the human population is women.
women arent humans, simp retard
you need some blackpills and probably age. you dont confess your love to girls xDD you develop love for girls who level with you.

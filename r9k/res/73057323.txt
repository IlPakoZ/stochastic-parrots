Senior in high school and I'm very paranoid about people recording me and posting it to Tiktok after a thread I saw here. I don't use Tiktok but I'm scared of being mad fun of without me knowing. Why won't my anxiety meds work?
I know the girls in my class record me, but to be fair i do stare at them all day and don't exactly make it subtle
lol i got bullied by a random group of 15 teenagers like 4 months ago and posted on 4chan
it's real
tiktok* sorry im high i didnt notice i said 4chan

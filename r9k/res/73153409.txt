Tatsumaki's butt. I cant stop thinking about it, why? What is it about her rear end that is so fascinating and alluring?
Every day I find myself thinking about its shape and its scent.
What do I like best about it? The two round cheeks or the crack that they create? It's like a million-year-old riddle posed by evolution and the universe itself. I keep mulling it over and over in my head but I cant come up with an answer. A shape so simple yet I can never fully hold it in my head, and if I can never fully grasp it, I can't get bored of it. 
I cant believe I might contemplate her ass for the rest of my life.

Fuckin hate that site.
why?

It's a centralized site that will encompass everything one day.
Centralized supersites are scary, they might become the next Google.
Also, they're archiving everything for no reason, it's scary. What kind of database are they building on us?
<comment>
Agreed, though it is fun to think that almost all of the things humans have done will never truly dissapear

I got called a pedo by anons and they archived that too
This scares me

Well, I officially reached 30 on April 21. This is it, I have become a wizard. 
It's over for me, there is no coming back from this or recovering. Even if by some miracle a girl did one day take interest in me she would either discover I was a virgin for 30+ years of my existence or I would have to pathologically lie to her at the beginning of our relationship. 
My life is simply not worth living anymore.

Can you play an instrument? You can be like a guitar wizard or something, that would be neat.

27m, current non-NEET, khhv and more actually.
I never held a convo with a woman other than my mother before, so I'm like the truest of truecels, and I show no signs of anything but neurotypical as well.
I don't know but its seems like I'm a wizard already...Life is full of empty wishes.

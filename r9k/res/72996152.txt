Is femanon's gaming chair strong enough?
1) im not that overweight
2) a proper chair is a good investment you should go in in, OP
Why not?
i don't want to live a miserable unhealthy life and then die early
How would being an obese gamer make you die early?
obese-ness is linked to many early death things like cancer, diabetes, COPD, etc
Fucking kill yourself faggot holy shit
Obese women are linked to many things like being cuddly, cuteness, and having soft tummies.
i dont care to be a casualty to fatness
my office chair is rated for 400lb landbeasts
Nigga how is looking like this is going to make you a casualty?
she be dead in a year if she were in the real world.
i refuse to do that
How would she be dead in a year? She looks reasonably healthy.
you are obviously being obtuse. this is the last I will respond to you. good day
Well okay.
You won't be big and beautiful.
Women grow just like their beauty.
"Not that overweight"
Get a grip in your life and start working out or dieting. Leave the current miserable fatfuck you behind, change for the better
I weep
But Femanon should be a fat fuck.

Sounds like the home owner, was just paranoid. It is not unheard of, for robbers to knock at your door, so they can bum rush in, when you open the door. I don't think it was, because he was black. I think, the only reason this is on the news, outside of that city, is because, he was black.

You're missing the point here. This kid wasn't "randomly shot", he was barging into somebody's house and the homeowner (rightfully) thought he was a robber. Literally nobody wants to see good people get shot.
<comment>
I accidentally got into the wrong taxi that was parked behind my taxi waiting for me as I used the ATM one time. I was like 24 or something and the woman in the back of it screamed bloody murder as I just froze and just looked at her shocked. 
In America, she would have pulled out a 9mm and put a full round in my chest. 
Im white for the record.
<comment>
Dude how the fuck could you mix up your parents' car at 11? Did you not pay attention to license plates?

No, he is innocent until proven guilty. Yes, he killed the kid, but it is not murder, yet.

No she wouldn't, stop being paranoid. The only times whites are victims of violence are at the hands of blacks and blacks don't drive taxis.

as god intended to
this is unironically how things should be
<comment>
It is not unheard of, for robbers to knock at your door, so they can bum rush in, when you open the door.
It is pretty unheard of. That's one of those urban myths, like the one about the gang that initiates members by having them knock on random doors and shoot whoever opens. Most thieves break into houses at night when no ones home, they don't knock on people's doors in the middle of the day and run inside their houses. That's an insane thing to do and has a very low chance of success.
But even if this was something that happened, assuming that the kid who knocked on your door is there for that reason is even more retarded. Who the fuck opens the door and shoots a person in the head twice? That's beyond racism, that's just being mentally deranged.
<comment>
regardless of whether he did it because the kid was black or not this is murder
If the kid tried to open the door - or if he actually managed to get inside the house, as some reports are saying - then it's just a tragic misunderstanding. Not murder.
<comment>
i said at most, all i know is that i was really small
<comment>
Dude why dont you have the autistic ability to memorize random strings of numbers and letters
You must have an IQ below 90 if you can't remember even a few characters of the license plate from a car you ride almost every day. I bet you can't remember your own phone number or Social Security number either.
<comment>
Whites kill more whites than blacks kill whites, retard.
Go back to /pol/.
<comment>
I agree that it's an understandable mistake. I've never gotten INTO the wrong car, but I have walked over to the wrong car and stood to one side of it pushing my key fob over and over until I realized I had the wrong grey CRV of the 50 grey CRV's in the supermarket parking lot.
And if you make that mistake enough times, EVENTUALLY you will be in an unpleasant confrontation. You might do it 999 times and have people be understanding and laugh along with you about your silly mistake...but 1 time out of 1000, it will spiral out of control and bad shit might go down. So you want to minimize the number of times you make a similar mistake, so you don't lose that lottery.
<comment>
Yeah most people who have sex dont remember those things. Theyre busy having and thinking about sex all the time.

Dead people aren't having sex, retard.

He didnt even open the door. He shot at him twice THROUGH THE DOOR, as in through the closed doorframe.
Guy is probably mentally ill and will be convicted.
<comment>
He shot at him twice THROUGH THE DOOR, as in through the closed doorframe.
I'm gonna need some solid proof on this one. Are there any witnesses or video evidence of this?
<comment>
There are 2 bulletholes in the doorframe. The suspect himself said in his statement to police that he shot through the door because he thought he was there to break into his house.
<comment>
Even the kid's family doesn't claim that.
They claim the homeowner opened the door, and shot through the open door.
Although how they could possibly pretend to know that when they have no statement from either the kid or the shooter is anyone's guess.
The kid is alive, BTW. So everyone in the thread calling this "murder" is a fucking retard right off the bat.

He is going to jail, w*t0id

it just makes me sad if anything :P why have people come to expecting the worst at their door? at the end of the day the homeowner wont be punished as it could be argued to be completely legal esp because its private property, but i still feel bad for the kids family.

Similar is girls setting up guys through dating apps to get robbed
<comment>
The description of his injuries came from a MOTHERFUCKING GOFUNDME that his family set up.
The odds are that they exaggerated how badly he was hurt. If he got shot in the ear, they might call that a head shot for the purposes of trying to get free money from people on the internet.

Black Lives Matter am I right?

The problem is the proportionality of those stats. Stop treating /pol/ like it's a boogieman.

I know of one instance locally where a drunk guy on payday at a local bar got with a prostitute at the bar, and they went out back to the alley to "fuck" and the guy ended up getting robbed and assaulted by two dudes who were using the prostitute as bait.

Stop treating /pol/ like its a boogieman.
Nobody does. They treat it like the retarded child constantly making threats to shoot up the school.
<comment>
assaulted... sexually?
<comment>
Yes this is something black criminals also do they use a black female to lure you because they know your stupid ass will drop your guard and easily trust a woman. The most evil shit Ive seen them do is coach a little black child to go up to a door and ask them for help when the retard opens the door if they dont close it they are getting robbed. You can fucknig trust anyone with black people god I hate them.

<comment>
No, I said the retarded child. The one constantly making threats everyone knows they will never act on because they are too weak and mentally challenged to. Half the time people get so exasperated they end up telling them to just fucking do it so they dont have to tolerate listening to their inane rantings anymore. 
Meanwhile everyone and anyone avoids them like the plague. Not because they are scared of them, like the retarded child (pol) believes in his fantastical mind and delusional self-image, but simply because people find them depressing, embarrassing and tedious to be around.
You know like your own family does with you.
<comment>
He dindu nuffin! He jus' on he way 2 da church!

/pol/ is a board of thousands of posters. I don't think the majority of them have committed a crime.

All pol does is serve to make the actual right look more unhinged, embarrassing, retarded, alienating and intolerable to almost everyone in the general population.
Pol is like a gifthorse to the left, which is why they never actually talk about banning it or try to. 
It presents absolutely no threat to them whatsoever and is basically like a propaganda outlet supporting all the wideeyed claims they constantly make about white people and the right.
<comment>
Yup, every single victim was black. So expect the media to shrug. It happened in the same town as Floyd's Feed &amp; Seed, which thankfully was unharmed.
<comment>
/pol/ is a board of thousands of posters. I don't think the majority of them have committed a crime.
Anyone who loudly proclaims they're on team mass shooter is one of the bad guys.
I don't agree it poses no threat. Church and mosques have already been shot up in the name of /pol/.
<comment>
Pol is the most normie, reddit board on 4chan. Its literally just r/theDonald refugees from 2016 by this point. 
All the satire and irony and subtlety of the original pol is completely dead by this point and its just infested by doubledigit IQ normgroid filth.
<comment>
Church and mosques have already been shot up in the name of /pol/.
That is not a threat. Every single one of those attacks has caused significant lurches to the left in Western countries. Meanwhile Islamist and attacks on whites ALSO seems to cause white people to lurch left and try to paint the perpetrators as the real victims. 
Its bizarre. Some people are just built to be conquered.
<comment>
/pol/ is a honey pot
<comment>
Meanwhile Islamist and attacks on whites ALSO seems to cause white people to lurch left
This is actually untrue. Many whites are actually waking up and are much more racist overall.
<comment>
Familiarize yourself with the word ancedotal.
In this situation, anecdotal evidence comprehensively rebuts your argument, because you argued that these events did not happen at all and were mere urban legends.
Because you were fucking stupid enough to say that, an anon presenting even a handful of cases proves that you are wrong.
When you claim, "X is a myth!" anecdotes prove you wrong.

He entered an old man's house uninvited thinking it was a completely different house that looked completely different and his supposed target house was actually on a completely different street with a completely different address. And it happened after 10pm too. Black, white, mexican, or alien. If someone is breaking and entering my house late at night I'm going to open fire before letting a criminal shoot me first. It's basic manners not to bust up in some strangers house late at night.

<comment>
I wonder why the shooter wasn't content to just leave the door closed
It's amazing, I wonder if he will change his door to a more secure door.
Imagine that your front door isn't enough to make you feel safe. Why the fuck would somebody have a front door or walls that they felt couldn't keep out intruders.
I mean seriously. If the guy was that paranoid about people being able to break-down his door (let alone a teenager who seems to have a skinny non-muscular body), then why didn't he reinforce the door in some way
<comment>
Shooter is literally an old white man he comes from a time when normies acted civilized
<comment>
To be fair, we don't actually know whether he entered the home or not.
<comment>
it's been confirmed that the kid wasn't barging into the house by everyone?
<comment>
What I am implying is pretty obvious although it's not explicitly said
<comment>
What's funny is that in the story I read, the kid ran away from the house and went to two different houses trying to get help.
At one house no one answered the door. At the next house a DIFFERENT homeowner came out, pointed a gun at him, and ordered him to lie on the ground until the cops got there.
YOU CAME TO THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD, MOTHERFUCKER.
Granted the second homeowner probably heard the other gunshots. But it's still funny to me that two out of three doors this kid went to, somebody drew down on him.
<comment>
it's been confirmed that the kid wasn't barging into the house by everyone?
No it hasn't. We have a statement by the kid's family on a GoFundMe page. And a statement by the family lawyer.

<comment>
He got confusednand went to the wrong house, definitely didnt ring the doorbell to make sure there was no one in it so he could break in
Fuck off
<comment>
I literally can't feel bad for him because based on his family's reaction, he almost certainly was the type of nog who makes excuses for niggers committing heinous crimes. If you won't police your "community" and stop the criminal element from flourishing in it, then you deserve to be treated with suspicion by default just for being black and I have no sympathy.
<comment>
I'm lazy, but you can report racists you know
<comment>
I'm not even being racist, if his family had come out and simply said something like "oh he dindu nuffin he's a good boy" without mentioning race, then as the story has been presented, I would have sympathy. But they immediately pulled the race card which says to me that they are the exact type of people who encourage the criminality amongst blacks which would cause someone to immediately assume a young black man is trying to commit a crime against them.

The shooter is 84 years old, he probably has some stage of Alzheimers or dementia plus he's from a time when blacks were (correctly) viewed as dangerous criminals instead of oppressed doctors and lawyers and engineers. Also if you live that long in a city as blacked as Kansas City you've likely had some close calls with jogger buffoonery and know not to relax around them.

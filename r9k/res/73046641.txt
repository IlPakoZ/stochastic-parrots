I fucked up really bad
I've been sleeping with my older brother's life long best friend ever since I moved back home during covid and he caught me texting him last night and confronted us and knows everything now
<comment>
suck your brother penis
<comment>
This really sounds like a /b/ or /adv/ problem, you stupid normie skank.
Or fag. I guess you could be a fag. In that case, it's an /lgbt/ problem.
<comment>
dont forget u shit and theres tiny parts of poo around ur anus you cant see afterwards.
<comment>
so
are you guys going to become something serious or just screw around
really he shouldn't be mad at you, the responsibility belongs with the friend
<comment>
Honestly we are a thing. We hang out in the next town over so we don't get caught. But we started legitimately dating as soon as covid shit wasn't a problem anymore. We agreed to stay away for a week so we can avoid any sort of immediate retaliation. It was my idea to keep it secret honestly we probably should have been up front about it. Their friendship is really special and I thought that we could protect it. We weren't supposed to go on this long.
<comment>
hopefully your brother gives you a rape correction
<comment>
/b/ is too horny and /adv/ is slow and dumb
wew

I fucked up
I'm a whore 
Don't be a fag anon
This hooker doesn't really need advice, she just wants attention and she knows this thread is guaranteed replies about her and her banal life
<comment>
Okay, you have a pretty obvious choice then. Do you two love each other? If so, apologize to your brother and mend the relationship over time. Keep dating the guy.
If not, cut things off, apologize to your brother and never keep secret relationships in the future.
<comment>
This. Hopefully your brother rapes/beats/cripples you. It's what a whore like you deserves. Post your tits and pussy or never post again.
<comment>
I do want to stay with him. He's been a surprisingly great partner and we put a lot of work into spending time together. I really don't know what to do though. Is it my responsibility to fix it? Is it his? Does my brother need to figure it out himself? Dealing with some guy code stuff that I don't understand.
<comment>
is it my responsibility to fix it
I would still argue it is more your boyfriend's responsibility, but you do share a bit of the burden.
Just sit your brother down and have an honest talk with him. Do not raise your voice and listen calmly to what he has to say.
He'll likely be very angry. When he finishes saying what he wanted to say, tell him that you and the friend will continue dating, and that you're sorry for keeping it secret.
It's going to be difficult to regain trust with your brother, but it is possible.
Time really does heal all wounds.
<comment>
How and why did you start banging?
<comment>
Okay. I'm really starting to regret keeping it a secret. I feel like I really screwed it up for us. I'm honestly a little scared of how mad he'll get, he was really mad last night and stayed out of the house all day today, probably to avoid me.
I started hanging out with them because I was lonely and mooching off of my brother for friends. We were at a bar and since I was under 21 I was driving. He puked in the bathroom so they told me to take him home and they would just get an uber. I ended up babysitting him and he slept in the extra room. Then we hung out all day the next day pretending that I had to nurse his hangover. He started bugging me about hanging out so I would go over to his place and after a month and a week or so I spent the night.
<comment>
Hmm. Well I certainly don't want anyone physically hurt. 
In that case take the conversation public, perhaps one of his favorite restaurants and buy him food. It won't make him immediately happy, but will soften the anger.
Oh, and you may want to consider living with the boyfriend for now.
Ultimately it's your relationship, and your brother doesn't get to decide what you two do. You do get to decide how to react to your brother's anger, and (hopefully) mend your relationship with him.

im the brother's best friend ama at kick.com/leafy
<comment>
Why do zoomer whores like you expect any answers deserving respect
<comment>
Breaking through the living barrier would be a big deal. I think I would be okay but it's still invading his space. So that means I would probably need to have two big conversations. I think you might be right though. I want to keep going and it would be easier without any kind of disdain hitting me whenever I walk out the door. Phwew my heart rate is moving thinking about these hard conversations.
Woah a twitch competitor
<comment>
i think its fine if you pursue a relationship, sibling relationships and friendships naturally deteriorate in the face of blossoming family relationships anyway. and if i was your brother, i'd honestly be fine with it if you were just up front about it and you had sex with me a dozen times (raw, creampie)
<comment>
Have the living conversation first with the boyfriend, then both of you should go together to see your brother.
You can do this anon. Do not be afraid, you'll feel a lot better when you finally do it.
Oh, and regardless of what happens make sure you two take care of each other afterwards and do something relaxing/fun.
<comment>
Have you considered that the reason your brother kept his friend around was to get closer to his sister. He knew that if he got an attractive friend, he might have an in with you despite being your brother. Now, you banged his friend and left him cucked.
You wanna make this right? Go up to your brother in just a pajama top and whisper in his ear "you can have me in any hole. I'm yours for the next five hours no strings attached."
<comment>
i am going to larp on /adv/ with your story
<comment>
Brother here, and that's all I wanted. Been waiting 20 years to spread those sweet cheeks and get a sniff.
<comment>
I think you're right, about the first part obviously. Relationships from childhood don't last forever. I don't talk to almost any of my friends from when I was growing up. Maybe it's better to accept what I have with him now is worth damaging other relationships.
Thank you. I'm not much of a talker, kinda why I decided that hiding everything was better. I don't do serious very well. I'm better at things like planning what we'll do if it all works out.
what the fuck
<comment>
All women with problems that turn to 4chan for answers should kill themselves. Imagine if your mother was such a stupid fucking retard that she asked an anonymous image board how to raise you. That's what young cunts like OP do. They're shameless, worthless whores undeserving of even pity.
<comment>
Honestly, one idea would be to have a threeway with your brother and his friend. You wouldn't even need to slide down on your bro's dick. You could just give it a steady suck as his friend comes deep in you from behind.
I did this for my brother when he and his cousin were fighting. Getting cummed in can be a bonding experience for more than just you and your new partner.
<comment>
This. And OP knows she's a whore. That's why she comes here to people she knows will tell her that. It's a coward's way of hearing the truth.
You had 8 billion other people to bang, OP, but you chose your brother's best friend. You're such a dirty slut. You just live to get your holes filled.
<comment>
Does the guy have a big dick at least?
<comment>
I don't know I got some really legitimate guidance.
alright, alright, guess we gotta derail eventually
He's the only person that's even seen me naked other than my family though. He took my virginity.
I think so but he's humble about it
<comment>
about the first part obviously
this comment is proof that you made this thread SOLELY to find posts that reinforce your already existing beliefs about the situation. this whole thread is an exercise in confirmation bias. yes good job your body count is astronomical and you're burning down a sacred covenant between two honest men to make it astronimcal+1, or equally likely, to have a marriage that has a 80+% chance of ending in divorce. you can proceed with your plan guilt free now
<comment>
And the problem is?
(Besides the obvious one- sexhaving normie coming to our pit of loneliness and misery. GTFO REEEEEEE!)
Are your parents too conservative and you're too afraid to let them know you're gay or something?
<comment>
you don't seem to understand. men metabolize the entire universe through their dicks. men love, fight for, forgive, and devote themselves to that which they ejaculate inside. it is not derailing, it is the simplest solution.
unless you're chad and have a million options then all that goes out the window. us non-sexhavers have to protect our rare cum receptacles like finding nemo
<comment>
Well first I'm not going to suck my brother's dick and second I'm definitely not considering the possibility of a threesome with him either.
<comment>
Why not? What's the issue?
<comment>
I hope you ultimately just kill yourself. You're a disgusting slut that makes the world a worse place just by being around. I didn't read all this thread because I'm drunk and angry, but I can already imagine what idiotic comments and remarks a knuckleheaded cunthaver like you would make.Fuck you. Sincerely, just fuck you. Women fuck up every single social space they invade, and here you are, wasting the time of stupid, hopefully zoomer faggots with your pussy-wafting, demure flirtation. You are absolute, utter fucking garbage, and no one with any bit of self-respect could possibly genuinely like you, let alone love you.
<comment>
Is he a virgin and does he know you were a virgin? I highly bet he wasn't and sooner than later this will end as a pump-and-dump.
You've created a really volatile situation which very rarely ends well. I can't see the drama not driving someone away especially since you and this guy are barely a thing.
<comment>
No he wasn't a virgin but we are definitely a thing don't downplay it just to make me anxious :(
<comment>
obvious ragebait shitpost
ah yes, let me forgo the actual advice board and post this ragebait on the angriest board on 4chan
yeah yeah fuck off
<comment>
You keep calling it a "thing". If it were more serious then that, then you'd be preaching it.
The reality is that you're both young, keeping a large secret, and you have some fucked up sister/brother/best friend triangle that is liable to explode.
Some other facts:
young people don't deal with drama well
best friends don't deal with drama well
"things" don't survive drama well
a brother doesn't take his sister fucking his best friend well
No, I can't see this lasting. You lost your virginity to a pump-and-dump. You're just waiting for the other shoe to drop.
<comment>
It's been almost three years I don't understand what you mean.
<comment>
Also ever heard of past behavior predicts future? This guy wasn't a virgin before meeting you and he sure won't be after.
Should have considered that before banging your bro's best friend.
<comment>
This guy wasn't a virgin before meeting you and he sure won't be after.
he sure won't be after.
O_O
Anon, were you expecting virginity to come back after having sex?

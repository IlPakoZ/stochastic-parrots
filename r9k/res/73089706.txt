China is severely underrated for black men
Asian women love bbc almost as much as they love cheating on their white husbands.
He's fucking scared because he knows this is China. Women will be women everywhere but good luck not getting killed for dating one as a black over there.
China is based:
Japan and Korea are too stuck up and rayciss.
Nah, Chinese guys just seethe by taking creepshots and posting it online
How? China hates blacks lol. Unless the black guy is an NBA player.
No they don't. I've taught English in Shanghai for 4 years, aggressive Chinese drunks give zero fucks and will attack you because the state will not arrest them. Authorities will take you in first because you're a foreigner.
There are a shit ton of Africans in Shanghai who speak Chinese and study there but it is an absolute rarity to see a BMAF anywhere in China. They're there, but it's like 1 out of every 10,000 couples
Can't speak for myself but my uncle used to teach English in China and he told me he would often get randomly attacked by drunk nationalist and the police wouldn't do anything about it saying it was a civil issue.
That's exactly how it is. My friend was riding his motor scooter on the designated area of the road, he was hit by a driver who was on his phone, a fight ensued and the police came and arrested my friend because he's a foreigner. The guy in the car who was at fault had nothing happen to him at all
Every black guy in Guangzhou has a Chinese wife

What a blast
the masked cooking bitch?
How rude and bitter
What a hollow feeling, to be kept always at an arm's length. That would really hurt me if I got close to someone like that with no prospects of meeting.
You get used to it, anon. All the meaningful relationships of my life have been long-distance. Even if I'll never get to meet her, I'm still glad we can stay close and nobody will take her away from me.
I hope so. I'd feel so unbelievably anxious if she spent more time with someone else instead of me. I don't think I'd be able to handle that, good luck man.
Hmm, no, she spends most of her time programming at home, is too autistic for her colleagues afaik
Post her cosplays
Her threads are public
Post one of her threads then
Just search Alice3D on /b/ and you'll find plenty
Cute. Sorry it didn't work out for you anon
I said I'm happy to talk with her so it's working out, her identity is a mystery to anyone not just me

be me in my late teens
find this weird anon who cosplays as Alice and other Touhou characters to "help Anonymous" with moral support threads
she's been doing this for decades and never revealed her face, some sort of giga autism
she's almost 5 years older than me and likes getting called big sister
add her and grow attached to her
tell her about my private life and my emotional issues every day
eventually we grow close and she feels comfortable acting as an older sister figure with me
still refuses to reveal her identity to me though we've known each other for 5 years
tfw a girl whose face I never saw knows about me more than my parents and my friends
tfw there's only a slight chance I'll ever see her before she dies due to health complications
tfw i have now a preference for cosplay girls and feel aroused by girls who hide their faces
What a blast
the masked cooking bitch?
How rude and bitter
What a hollow feeling, to be kept always at an arm's length. That would really hurt me if I got close to someone like that with no prospects of meeting.
You get used to it, anon. All the meaningful relationships of my life have been long-distance. Even if I'll never get to meet her, I'm still glad we can stay close and nobody will take her away from me.
nobody will take her away from me.
I hope so. I'd feel so unbelievably anxious if she spent more time with someone else instead of me. I don't think I'd be able to handle that, good luck man.
Hmm, no, she spends most of her time programming at home, is too autistic for her colleagues afaik
Post her cosplays
Her threads are public
Post one of her threads then
Just search Alice3D on /b/ and you'll find plenty
Cute. Sorry it didn't work out for you anon
I said I'm happy to talk with her so it's working out, her identity is a mystery to anyone not just me

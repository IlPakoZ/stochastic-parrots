be me as a kid
autism
really enjoy to sniff people 
sniff their armpits without hesitation
really enjoy some people odor
grow up and stop doing it because obviously it wasn't correct to go through life cynically sniffing at people
the feeling of enjoying the smell of certain people never left
I'd sniff sniff sniff my bf if I had one 
I even enjoy the smell of my own vagina
what's wrong with me please help me
I promise I don't smell people as much as I used to. I really have a strong attachment to body odors. It was always my most embarrassing secret (not so secret in my childhood).

Good smells are good smells. That's that. Don't know what you expect really, shrugs

Where are you located, sniffarina? If you're close enough I'll let you sniff as much as you want.

Cuddling and burying your face in her neck and inhaling deeply. Heavenly.
I often find the people I'm most attracted to smell way better to me.

I'm not autistic but I took really notice how people smell and enjoy sniffing armpits. I recently saw this which I think explains it for me. Tfw no gf to sniff her pits.

Well, you're further away than I anticipated, femanon-chan.

Well that explains a lot.
I did it without the consent of the other person. But I was just a kid. My parents explained to me that I couldn't do that. I remember they told me "When you have a boyfriend, are you going to sniff him like you were a dog?"
In general, I love to smell the sweat, skin, hair of my loved ones. They make me feel at home, very safe.

Sorry. It is a misunderstanding. I'm not Japanese, the comment was not original and I couldn't post it.

It's true autists can't read tone. :')
Mexico is still a bit far, sadly.

I never did that, that's probably just an autism thing. Although I did compulsively put my hand in my pants as a kid. I have tried sniffing gfs armpits before and most of them don't mind I think liking the smell of your partner is considered pretty normal just don't be sniffing them in front of others maybe.

Oh hahah that's funny, sorry! Despite my age, I still have problems with those kind of things. But I keep trying!
What a pity, anon. Saludos !

Yes, I've seen what they say about being attracted to your partner's scent. Don't worry, I don't smell people that way anymore. Although I have to admit that I do it with my friends and, in due course, I will do it with my partner. It's like an instinct, I think.

I've often wondered about human's scent and pheromones dynamic. We are just another species of ape afterall. I have good genetics and I swear people often notice my presence before their eyes even see me. I've been told I smell good before but I wonder if my personal scent has an affect on people.

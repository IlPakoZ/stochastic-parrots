another sleepless night, another thread. still a neet with no job, no degree and no gf. still feel like shit. still getting the chest pains.
life hasn't been going well for a while. it won't be chnaging any time soon. I have no hope left at this point. I feel like there is no fixing my life at this point. idk I've been feeling worse these last couple of weeks. I'm just really really tired. I don't wanna do anything anymore. I have nothing good to life for. only things I have is anxiety, stress and depression.
tell me anons, why can't I have nice thing in this life?

My life is falling apart. There is no hope for me. It's all going to end, and I'll be homeless, friendless, and probably die because I'm not totally equipped for that kind of life.
It's always been goodbye everyone and it all fades away. Like nobody has ever really wanted me on a personal level.
So it's over for that reason.
I'm too weird. I know I'm fucking weird.
And I'm a twisted mean, cruel person.
Caught up with calling people liars or LARPers.
Look what we all do here. The charade is lame.

I wish life was easier, more forgiving.
My life is falling apart
my life is already fell apart. it's my sanity falling apart.
Like nobody has ever really wanted me on a personal level.
people are mean and lack empathy. I hate people like you wouldn't believe.
I'm too weird. I know I'm fucking weird.
And I'm a twisted mean, cruel person.
I'd say be a better person but being nice doesn't really change anything. I've been nice my whole life and it didn't really helped me. maybe on the other side it'll help me to find some peace that I didn't find on this earth idk.

if you don't mind me asking, what do you want from life most?
<comment>
honestly if you were in my city I could change your life, guaranteed. It's never fully over.

I'm not even sure myself. maybe a job, nice friends, a gf, I don't really know. all I know is I want to be happy.

no doubt about that, but I want to change it for better not for worse.

Precisely dawg, job I can't help with unless you can work as security but I could definitely hook you up with girls and friends.

i feel the same, i've tried hard to obtain those things but i keep falling and failing.
i keep trying to get back up again, this is my third attempt trying to go back to school and my 2nd attempt trying to make friends. i just feel so disconnected and distant from everyone.
i wonder if my time as a NEET has ruined me beyond repair but i want to keep trying just in case.
i keep making up unrealistic scenarios in my head where i find someone like me to get our life together with but i know that's a fantasy.

security
I'm not from US. idk how to use a gun. also I'm a very thin guy. I wouldn't be a good security guard.

well thanks for being nice, but I don't live in the states.
i feel the same, i've tried hard to obtain those things but i keep falling and failing.
yep, same here
this is my third attempt trying to go back to school and my 2nd attempt trying to make friends.
already done that. most people at college aren't very friendly. they just befriend poeple if they have something to gain. when they're done, your friendship is over.
i just feel so disconnected and distant from everyone.
socializing is not only about you, the people your socializing also importent. if they're assholes you won't be getting anywhere and most of the time they are assholes
i wonder if my time as a NEET has ruined me beyond repair
only thing you lose as a NEET is your time and potential money you could've earned.
i keep making up unrealistic scenarios in my head where i find someone like me to get our life together with but i know that's a fantasy.
I sometime think similar stuff too. it's all in your head, it's all a dream.

You're either Italian or Eastern Euro, aren't you.

I mean not all of them bad. I can't say I hate them all but can't really say I like them. what I really hate are faggots and trannies. I read some news that they changed their traffic lights with some faggot symbols. and also saw some pictures where they painted faggot flag on roads. I don't think I'm going there ever again.

you'll never know

If you're like most anons, at least you can look forward to a hopefully not-made-worthless-by-inflation inheritance. I know I do, but as it turns out anxiety kills you faster than expected, what good is money if when I get my hands on it all will be spent on medical bills....

I'm not inheritance any shit. I don't have rich relatives or a rich family.
as it turns out anxiety kills you faster than expected
not as fast as I hoped so

You have bigger things to worry about than faggot colored traffic lights.
<comment>
that's not hatred then, just being a dumbass, if that insignificant amount of faggotry makes you seethe then it's no wonder you don't have friends brother. You're extremely sensitive yet you decry people who are shallow assholes. It's always a doozy to see someone on the bottom rung of society trying to feel superior by stomping on other people who are failures in their own right (trannies, people with down syndrome, etc). It sounds like a chore to be your friend.
<comment>
the personality meme strikes again, you can't be ugly/asocial AND a jerk. Pick a struggle bro goddamn, traffic lights? really? lol, lmao even.

There is something missing to the Angel Devil that makes me want to hug him...
Good images Anon, I hope you are ok. I have lost just about everything and have been losing it. It's not even the suicidal thoughts or constant traumatic recollection or fear, it's the numbness of it all, its all I know.

I'm not worrying about them, it's not my country. I couldn't care less
that's not hatred then, just being a dumbass
dumbest thing I've done is going to a wesite called 4chan

I'm not seething, I just hate faggot it's that simple. and also I have few friends and all of them don't like faggots. it's common thing to hate them.
someone on the bottom rung of society trying to feel superior by stomping on other people who are failures in their own right (trannies, people with down syndrome, etc)
why put trannies and people with down syndrome in the same example. one of them is a genetic sickness and other is a mental disorder. also I'm not saying I'm superior or anything. I'm just saying that I'm not stupid enough to put my dick into another man's asshole and get hiv. or I'm stupid enough paying to get my cock cut off.
It sounds like a chore to be your friend.
only if you're a faggot or a tranny.
traffic lights? really?
must be nice for you to see genderless light faggot.
There is something missing to the Angel Devil that makes me want to hug him...
his life got destroyed by makima. everyone he knew and loved is gone because of that bitch. also he can't hug anybody because of his power.
Good images Anon
thnaks
I have lost just about everything and have been losing it.
I've lost my will to live or do anything.
it's the numbness of it all, its all I know.
it's all a dream.

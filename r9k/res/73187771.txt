It is the 3rd day of Elliot's Month, incels. 
Last night, I started listening to the female robovoice audiobook of My Twisted World for the first time in years. It's a 10 hour long audio, and I listened to around 2 hours last night. Things have left off at Age 11. 
I'm going to make my way through the rest of it over the next few days. 
I'm also going to listen to it in full on May 23. As well as watching other Elliot videos and honoring the Painbringer. 
It feels so good to hear his words once more, and I am again startled and alarmed at how similar our childhood experiences were. 
I love you, Elliot. Mine king.

OP here. 123rd day for me. Stay strong, kings.

3rd day for me, too. Almost broke today.
Fucking internet whores won't get the better of me this time, dammit.
I should probably stay off /b/ for a while.

It's not the 3rd day of nofap for me. I've been going since January 1. It's the 3rd day of Elliot's Month (May).

I miss him boys. The supreme gentleman.

He truly was the Last Gentleman. Everyone thought he was a homosexual, simply because he was a gentleman. It's sick.

Nice going, Anon. Feel any different?
I started on 1st May because it was a Monday and easy to remember how many days I've gone without.

Yeah I feel a hell of a lot different. I genuinely believe I was on the brink of death right before starting this Eternal Nofap at Midnight on January 1. 
It's crazy looking back to see how far I've come and the things I've done just in this 122 day period.

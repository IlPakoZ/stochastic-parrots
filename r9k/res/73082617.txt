I watch asmr to feel human
If it can make you feel human, I'd say it's a good thing.
Go and feed the ducks or pigeons, take a walk in nature, write a poem, do volunteer work. 
Internet degeneracy is not the way anon
Anon, I have been awful
I'm sorry to hear that...
Would you feel any better sharing what's touching you?
My down-syndrome uncle is what's touching me
I watch it to coom because hearing a woman talk dirty into my ear does more for my orgasm than anything visual degeneracy can do
I watch it so I can have a cute girl whisper stuff to me before I fall asleep

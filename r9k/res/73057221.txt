heart rate goes down significantly after taking fish oil, D3 and magnesium 
I'm not getting sudden palpitations so far. I went to the emergency and took a bunch of tests and all the doctors chalked it up to "dehydration" when I was deficient it something else. They just see a minority and go "yeah fuck him, just say he's dehydrated and move on". I'm happy I figured out the problem I think.

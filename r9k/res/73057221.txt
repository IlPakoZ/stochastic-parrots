I'm not getting sudden palpitations so far. I went to the emergency and took a bunch of tests and all the doctors chalked it up to "dehydration" when I was deficient it something else. They just see a minority and go "yeah fuck him, just say he's dehydrated and move on". I'm happy I figured out the problem I think.
Glad to hear it, man. Hope it stays a non issue. Will put a word up with the big man for you
You really needed a doctor to tell you that ?
I had an issue and it turned out that I wasnt going outside at all and getting zero sunlight .

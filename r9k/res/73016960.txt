Everyone's still buying Bud Light like nothing happened. "Conservatives" and incels suck at boycotting things because not buying products goes against everything they stand for and were raised to believe. Capitalism. Consumerism. Live and let live. Non-coercion.
Of course conservacucks can boycott companies remember how they killed Gillette? Oh wait...
Can you explain to the non-Americans about the political significance of buying Bud Light
They did an advertizing campaign with a tranny and had his face printed on the cans
The feds will always protect drugs, alcohol, and fast food like I'm they're a sacred cow because those things keep the population sedated and mentally impaired.

WHY DIDNT ANYONE TELL ME HOW SOUL CRUSHING SOCIAL ISOLATION WAS AHHHHHHH
Normalfag moment
Dickhead you're cool though you'll get through it
This board always reminds me to be so thankful for my blessings. 
handsome blue eyes fast metabolism great proportions ect ect 
genuinely rare extremely high IQ
intp, introverted fully enjoy my own thoughts and company above everybody else and only rarely crave social interactions but just being flirted with by cashier girls satisfies me for days or weeks on end
I got the worst of both worlds being a handsome neet, but in many ways I have the best of both worlds because I can truly enjoy the benefits without the soul crushing reality of being ugly constantly looming within 2nd level orbit of my thought pattern like a dead pixel or leaky faucet.
It gets addicting after a while
I love being alone, it is my favorite time of the day, work is stressful and people cause drama everywhere, as soon as I get home I never leave for three days and it is amazing to be this free. then I have to go outside and the horror show begins
Once you've truly ascended you won't even care how you look anymore. 
You'll simply make yourself presentable when you have to enter normie clownworld and do what needs to be done.

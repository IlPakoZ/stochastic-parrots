day 98 of manifesting a lesbian bff who will save me by forcing me to talk about my feelings.
What difference does it make if it's a lesbian bff or someone online you can talk to, even more so if its a close online friend I'm sure at least one Anon would like to talk to you
I wish you luck
I think it's a preference thing. Perhaps the lesbian prefix is added to keep OP from seeing their manifestation as a potential mate
lesbians are the only type of people that can force me to talk about my feelings irl
That's interesting.
Is there any reason for this that you know of?

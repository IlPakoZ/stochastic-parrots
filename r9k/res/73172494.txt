How the fuck am I supposed to cope with the fact my autistic cousin who is a furry porn artist is making more money per month than I do wageslaving for an entire year? I'm living in a 3rd world post soviet shithole and the average income here is 800$ a month, meanwhile my cousin is making 5000$ a month drawing dog cocks (no I won't shill for him by giving you link, but if you're into furry porn you probably have seen his works). It's truly over, I feel so fucking worthless and like a huge clown for keeping this up, I'm demoralized as shit and I don't feel like going to work anymore.
My brother makes a lot doing furry porn I think it's cool and I'm a hopeless neet. Why can't you be proud of your cousin anon? It probably took a ton of work and practice for nothing before he got to the point he's at now.
Look; I think furfags need to yiff in hell also. But you need to recognize that the skills needed to be able to draw their degeneracy are a craft you can only hone through time and practice
I'm happy for him, actually, but also extremely envious since I have no artistic talent nor the creativity required to do so.
Yeah, I wish I had artistic talent
The talent just comes with practice, there's not much creativity as you're fulfilling other people's commissions.
Don't look now but I've got news for you, there are people out there making way, way more than $5,000 a month...
still good money considering where I live
Ask him to teach u retard, u both can make more money than u can imagine, work with him, don't compete

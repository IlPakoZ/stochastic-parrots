i think this girl from uni already knows i've taken interest in her, she has stated that she got burnt out by dating her last bf so i kinda shelved my idea of asking her out romantically but we still hangout pretty often and i've thought to myself if she really didn't want me around she'd just shut me out by now considering she doesn't have any male friends to begin with
how should i proceed? im not gonna wait around for her as i've already begun speaking to other people but i wouldn't mind getting with this girl and having a relationship. shes smart and talented and she just seems like a rarity with all the other people i've pursued or been with romantically, maybe i have autism

I think you should just be blunt with it, anon, especially since you're ready to move on anyway. Tell her, and get her answer.

She is rejecting you preemptively. You aren't hot enough. Women are never "burnt out". They will hop from one guy to another within a week if they are hot with a big cock. Sorry, she isn't into you, you're not hot enough.

Would a girl dump you on the first date for paying with a card instead of cash? Is it true that girls are only attracted to guys who use cash?

Yes, anon. It's true. Women are only attracted to men who use cash. This is a trait they've evolved to have because niggers only ever pay in cash, as it's easy to steal from an ATM. If they try to pay with a card, it gets declined, and they are forced to shoot up the restaurant.

So you're saying that girls like cash because niggers like cash?

I don't think I've ever heard anything like that before, why should the method of payment count towards anything?

Cash is hotter than a debit card or low class credit but if you have a prestigious card, especially one of those metal ones, credit card is the higher status move.

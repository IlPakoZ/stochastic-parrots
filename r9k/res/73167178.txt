Would a girl dump you on the first date for paying with a card instead of cash? Is it true that girls are only attracted to guys who use cash?
Yes, anon. It's true. Women are only attracted to men who use cash. This is a trait they've evolved to have because niggers only ever pay in cash, as it's easy to steal from an ATM. If they try to pay with a card, it gets declined, and they are forced to shoot up the restaurant.
So you're saying that girls like cash because niggers like cash?
I don't think I've ever heard anything like that before, why should the method of payment count towards anything?
Cash is hotter than a debit card or low class credit but if you have a prestigious card, especially one of those metal ones, credit card is the higher status move.

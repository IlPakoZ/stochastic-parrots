Do you put up a good facade so that the people have no idea that you're completely autistic and incapable of forming meaningful relationships?
I'm a robot, though no one in my life would know it
 It really makes you wonder just how many people you meet are actually robots, but just pretend to be a normie
of course i hide my powerlevel to the extent possible.
i worked with one guy who said during covid lockdowns that he didn't really notice a difference. cool dude.
Dont know if its good but I try
I tried for many years and it lead to an uncanny valley effect where they just hated me even more. I don't like being weird and I make the basic effort to hide my most extreme weirdness, but I no longer try to copy them completely since it's impossible to perfectly nail the appearance they want in interactions. I try and be the useful or smart one in hopes it makes up for looking at their eyeballs for some number of milliseconds too short or long or taking steps one or two centimeters too long or short in my gait or lacking the correct variation in pitch, tone, and volume over a spoken string of text. It's impossible to to convincingly fit it. The best we can hope for is their begrudging tolerance towards us.

experienced something similar. made steps to not being a pushover and dudes would bully me out of groups.
I;m too autistically honest to do the fake nice thing that normies do in their interactions. I can't be one of them.
same. i used to work on my small talk game when i still had a job. would ask people how their weekends was and as they started talking i realized ''jesus christ why did i do that i really dont give a fuck about any of this''. felt bad about it.

If you woke up tomorrow and were attractive, fit and had a huge cock, would you sell photos of yourself online? Assuming you make like top 10% of OnlyFans money. Don't lie.

No im a very asocial person and I like to leave as little of a foot print of myself as possible. And I value the exclusivity of intimacy too much to do something like that
<comment>
No I would not. I'm not lying. I probably could now since I'm a heightcel and you can't tell by pics. so no. it is filthy and immoral
<comment>
Yes, why wouldn't I? That's how life is on this capitalist hell hole.

<comment>

I would do it if I was guaranteed 5k+ a month. I would move to a country where that money means a lot more, then I would build an animal farm so I could have access to truly healthy food. I would live alone and die a virgin

interesting, i feel like that's not inaccurate. what's your methodology, anon

There's infographics available about race and IQ. I don't have them on hand. Also, there was a book published a while back about race and IQ. The penis size part of my post was a joke.

No one fucking cares.
I know guys with fully tested, confirmed, triple backed up IQs of 150, full geniuses, that work as truck drivers and guys with the same level of confidence that their IQ, tested is 105 that are PhDs in physics.
It doesn't fucking matter as much as your motivation

Can someone be normal/high IQ yet be slow at processing problems/puzzles/formulas?

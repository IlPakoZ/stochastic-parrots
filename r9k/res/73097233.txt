jesus christ I don't want a fucking enemy bugging me 24/7, what should I do?
this is 4chan I can't give you proper advice here
Why does he hate you so much? Have you talked to him?
The answer is obviously to tell him this and if he doesn't fuck off take it to the bosses
you think I didn't tried?
This fucking faggot tried to say that my morning greetings offended him but he's obviously just trying to beat the biggest one in the workplace as a newbie and gain status and shit seeing how he is still doing this after I cut most human contact with him
I know, some goofy fucking villian shit but yeah, I can't bargain with him in any ways
Ive been searching for this image for years.
what are your morning greetings, anon?
I said good morning
that's it
that pissed him off apparently

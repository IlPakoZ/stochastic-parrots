new guy at work
Have this low pitched 80s batman villian sound
literally lurks in the fucking shadows half of time
thought I am his sworn enemy
kept trying to make my life miserable 
tried to separate me and my coworkers despite no one give a fuck about office politics and just wanna go home
jesus christ I don't want a fucking enemy bugging me 24/7, what should I do?

this is 4chan I can't give you proper advice here

Why does he hate you so much? Have you talked to him?
<comment>
The answer is obviously to tell him this and if he doesn't fuck off take it to the bosses
<comment>
you think I didn't tried?
This fucking faggot tried to say that my morning greetings offended him but he's obviously just trying to beat the biggest one in the workplace as a newbie and gain status and shit seeing how he is still doing this after I cut most human contact with him
I know, some goofy fucking villian shit but yeah, I can't bargain with him in any ways

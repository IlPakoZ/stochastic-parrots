Normies always talk about signs you get from a girl before approaching her. 
But which signs do they even mean?

If she grabs your dick and asks to suck it, then you can probably approach her.

My only signs are she would slap me hard or hit me somewhere, it is usually physical

a sexy smile

Eye contact and/or smile, body language is huge. Receptive body language, 'submissive' body language, looking away while their body is pointing at you, nervously swaying back and forth with a smile etc.

Just talk to them retard. If they spend time talking to you it is easy to figure out.
Just talk to them.

These are my top 2 predictors of her being attracted to you
Eye contact with a smile, even better, if she's blushing
You catching her staring at you; you see her flick head to you in your peripheral vision as you pass by.
And for more social girls there's the classic
She says your name a lot when she talks to you
She talks to you in the first place
but those aren't as reliable as my top 2

Why don't you do something more productive with your time that won't possibly land you in jail or make you do things you'll regret?

any decent stalking tactics? I've been considering getting into it.

at night when i see a woman walking alone i charge at her screaming. watching them scream and freeze in terror is honestly funny

wish i had a robot stalking me

You're too ugly and boring to have stalkers

i used to pretend i was a government associate and knock at people's doors asking them stuff like how many people live in their house, how many hours do they work etc. but as ive moved to strictly school people i do that: in the first days or the first week you gotta go on foot following them, at a considerable distance. then you have to find routes to circle around their route, so it doesnt gets too obvious you are walking the same way she is. you gotta use alleys for your favor, look slightly down but enough so that you can see where she's going. if you feel shes looking too much at her shoulder or she suddenly gets her phone you gotta stop following for the day, and dont use those same clothes for at least 3 weeks. when she enters her home you need to find exactly how many windows are there, this is where you start the earlier gov associate method. dont let her see you at all if you go to school with her

thank you. I'll probably skip impersonating a fed though in case I did get caught

You're fucking larping dude.
You mean to tell me that you just knock on people's homes, tell them you're a "gov associate" and they give you info? That is fucking stupid.
You don't have a uniform, an id or a credible script.

you have no idea how easy its here, im not american. you literally only need a pen and a notebook
<comment>
At least make your larp believable, give me your script
In 4 I adlib
You're full of shit.

I would be down to stalk someone for the fun of it. But I don't want to go to Jail.

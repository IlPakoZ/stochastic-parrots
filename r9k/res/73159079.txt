No matter how you personally feel about trans you have to admit Bud Light thinking it's a good idea to have a trans spokesperson for the king of hillbilly beers was one of the dumbest moves possible.

Not to be the guy in the tinfoil hat, But they had to know ahead of time that the back lash would be ridiculous. You really think all these business moguls haven't watched company after company make the same blunder? They always have to be watching their competition and studying the way the market works To keep up. It's like nature, it has to evolve.
It's hard for me to believe that people who are in charge of the world can be that dumb. I've met someone I consider an elite of society And he is not a moron. This has to have been intentional.

From what I've seen a good deal of the revenue of this company is through middle men and not actual direct consumers. Similar to the American comic book industry This has insulated them temporarily but unlike capeshit they don't have a movie deal and boomers are sharing product lists.
The broke train is coming.

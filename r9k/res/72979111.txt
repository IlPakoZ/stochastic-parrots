I look around facebook and all I see are happy pictures. No, I've never met this guy, sometimes I just journey through facebook. To become a huge success and leader in my field I gave up everything. Looks like there's importance in being unimportant.
If I don't respond, I'll be back, going to the gas station to get cigs

Nope I don't think I'll ever be happy again.

I remember being 12, I used to play starcraft and listen to linkin park all day during the summer holidays. I was happy back then but only because I was hopeful.

I've never been happy. I've been too busy chasing my dreams. What a dream costs? Everything, and more. To live your dreams costs things you can't even imagine people are going to do to you, and what you're going to have to take.
I think I'll be happy, one day, maybe 10, 15 years. But in 15 years I'll b 46

I just want to live the dream I create as an illusion

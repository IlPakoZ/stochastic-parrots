How can women have so poor an understanding of what men want?
Men want either a feminine girl (sweet, caring, nurturing, docile) or a down to earth and chill tomboy with nice interests
They want either a woman that enhances her body in feminine ways or a tomboy who just dont care and dresses comfortably
They want virgins or low body count girls or girls that had not done casual sex
Yeat what women do?
They paint their hair hideous colors, they become drama queens, they become easoly beligerant and discuss in a inflamed way about topics they feel a lot about but dont know a lot about, they ruin their body with tattoos and piercings, they even boast about having fucked a lot of guys as if we were to be impressed and charmed by that
Its the complete opposite in every way, theres scarcely anything attractive about women today besides the fact they have pussy and tits and ass

They don't. They are trying to drive you off, be left alone, and often be spiteful to upset you
And it's working
<comment>
I want a dominant femdom gf who will feminize me and make me her gf (male)and I am dead serious
<comment>
I could understand if it was just that
But that behavior repulses Chad too, so I really think they have no fucking clue
<comment>
Women don't want to have to fit themselves into the narrow confines that traditional society tolerates for them
Which is pretty understandable. Just sucks that they then turn around and demand that men shove ourselves into the same narrow boxes that women rebel against, rather than being more tolerant since they themselves know how bad it can be.

You're dying alone btw.
<comment>
But that behavior repulses Chad too,
The feminine women are going for them, the unfeminine women are trying to be left alone
I know the robot narrative is that every single female alive is a nymphomaniac seeking sex but in my experience men severely underestimate the number of voluntarily celibate women who have no desire for partnership and genuinely want to be left alone by all men
<comment>

Bullshit
They are more than happy to confine themselves to anything
Any fanatic political or religious movement has a disproportionate amount of devote women, they are followers by nature
Now theu are more than happy to subscribe to woke progressivism, they love to subscribe to something, feel morally righteous and police each other behavior
They just traded their boxes, now they all think the same ideas and parrot the same social media bullshit without filters
<comment>
Women are volcel because they hate that more men aren't chads. They wish that allen would be chads while accepting them the way they are. If they can't get that, they'd rather be alone, but they still hate men over it
<comment>
Men do the same thing. They think women want men with roided bodies who disrespect them and try to out-alpha everybody 24/7.

This type of woman is just a cumrag for Chad in dormant form, she is just waiting for the right keyword from the right Chad to go nympho
She just havent met the right Chad
<comment>
The progressive stuff they subscribe to gives them more freedom vs traditionalism. Women have also often been leaders of those movements.
<comment>
Which is much much much more closer to the truth than what woment hink men want
<comment>
Women are volcel because even Chad isn't worth sticking around a man for too long.
My only relationship was with someone very conventionally attractive and much more experienced than me in bed yet he was still a man that did man things and had a retarded moid point of view about the world so I ultimately called it off.
No amount of good dick is worth sacrificing your sanity and living with a man for the rest of your life.
<comment>
more freedom
Lets make a Declaration of the Freedoms of Women
The freedom to be used for free by Chads
The freedom to be a wageslave
The freedom to not pass your genes
The freedom to die alone
The freedom to let your dumb emotional brain make decisions
The freedom to get money from the state, which took it from hard working men
The freedom avoid all responsibilities and still expect men to adhere to their responsibilities
The freedom to be a fat whore
The freedom to import immigrants that will rip the fabric of the nation apart
The freedom of ruining every work environment, piece of art or media, and casual conversation with the Party Approved Bullshit

woman fucks dumb Chad because of his looks, shocked that he is dumb
Many such cases
<comment>
No, it's not. Tons of dudes are perfectly fine fucking around with the dyed-hair tatted-up BPD socialist woman archetype that was described in the OP. Men have little to no standards, and I say that as a man. If men didn't simp for retarded women we wouldn't have the problems we have now. This place is the perfect example, robots hate women all day long until one posts a selfie with a timestamp then they become doormats, bad boys don't do that and that's why women date them.
<comment>
And what sort of man things in particular were the issue? Stuff like toxic masculinity and things of that nature?

Various things there are indeed good freedoms to have, or are things where the traditionalist solution just makes things even worse

Fucking is fucking, men just want a hole. A wife is something else, and once a hoe you cant go back to wife. Men dont have the same one way trap
bad boys don't do that and that's why women date them.
Well they cheat on them or give them a black eye too and the women stay, is not like women dating you amount to much so far as being a well rounded person goes, often quite the opposite, so theres no real reason to compare oncels to badboys, they are both broken in different ways, but one of them the women liek because they are all broken
<comment>
Why do you think you would be any better than said dumb chad?
You are just as retarded, except you don't even pretend to not be misogynistic and have socially liberal ideals. You are just shamelessly an apathetic person. 
And on top of that you're ugly and don't know how to make a woman orgasm.
All men are the same. Yes, even you, who thinks you're intelligent and unique. You're not, you're dumb and retarded and have moid brain. If I'm going to put up with men I'm at least going to put up with the one that has a pretty face lul.
<comment>

Plenty of us would be fine even without any sex, it's not "men just want a hole", it's "the few women females see as desirable and acceptable often just want a hole". Plenty of guys don't buy into that hoe/wife dichotomy bs - but then, nothing's less desirable to the women who complain about that sort of thing than a male feminist who agrees with the complaints

Whenever I would stay over at his place for an extended period of time it would become painfully obvious he's had his mommy do things for him for way too long and it just made me cringe.
Like he knew how to do laundry and stuff like that ofc, but every domestic task he did it was like...he did it in such a man way, you know what i mean? half-assed and retarded.
i hate incompetent men it just pissed me off.
also he would call himself a leftist and whatnot but every now and then there would be a little comment that would remind me he's still moid brain and doesn't understand half the things he propagates.
basically men are just dumb and half the time i'm not convinced you are real sentient human beings. hive mind.

They are all lesbians, I knew it!

But that IS what women want, anon. Look at all the men that women (actual women, not trannies) think are attractive.
<comment>
Female projection is a bitch, just like this poster
<comment>
See what I mean.
You are a virgin NEET loser and think you're unique and intelligent for something you had no part in and literally will never have a part in.
It's another example of moid brain: extreme arrogance and taking responsibility for other's accomplishments.
You are all the same.
<comment>
did i hit too close to home anon does your mommy do everything for you too?
reminder: if you ever do get married, over the years your wife will slowly resent you and withhold sex from you because you don't know to help around the house properly and it frustrates her. many such cases!
<comment>
Im not defending myself, Im defending men as a whole
You have a female brain looking for trouble, I cant evade that. Anything I talk about myself, you will say its fake
So let the evidence of History speak for itself, even tho I know evidence and truth have never stopped women from believing any bullshit they feel like
<comment>

Yeah, it's called madonna-whore complex and modern men need to overcome it. We need to stop incentivizing women to become whores and hold other men accountable for being simps. Anything else is just hypocritical, you can't watch porn or have casual sex and complain about sexual degeneracy in society. 
Well they cheat on them or give them a black eye too and the women stay, is not like women dating you amount to much so far as being a well rounded person goes, often quite the opposite, so theres no real reason to compare oncels to badboys, they are both broken in different ways, but one of them the women liek because they are all broken
Women like bad boys because they aren't doormats and they are confident, that doesn't mean they like being disrespected and abused. The problem is boys are growing up being taught that masculinity is bad and having their masculine nature shamed in schools and at home, they either rebel against that and become bad boys and embrace the violent confident side of masculinity or they cuck and become nice guy doormats and male feminists. Men who are strong, confident, and assertive but use those qualities for benevolent things are exceedingly rare but those men are the highest valued by women.

The real reason is because women are delusional ungrateful shrews
<comment>

Lower your standards and date male feminists who actually oppose misogyny and hold socially progressive ideals then, why is that so fucking awful for y'all to do?
And on top of that you're ugly and don't know how to make a woman orgasm.
Getting jackhammered by Chad is easier to orgasm from than having an ugly guy eat you out or whatever in a way where he's actually concerned about your pleasure?
Like he knew how to do laundry and stuff like that ofc, but every domestic task he did it was like...he did it in such a man way, you know what i mean? half-assed and retarded.
i hate incompetent men it just pissed me off.
I mean, did you ever tell him any of that? Did he make no effort to do better even if made aware of it? I get that it can be annoying but if a guy is literally just not raised with being taught to do stuff, it's not always obvious. Weaponized incompetence is a thing, but, like, did he actually have a chance to do better and still fucked it up/refused to do better?
also he would call himself a leftist and whatnot but every now and then there would be a little comment that would remind me he's still moid brain and doesn't understand half the things he propagates.
Was he open to being corrected?
<comment>
Yeah, it's called madonna-whore complex and modern men need to overcome it.
You didnt lay down the plan to overcome it, you layed down the plan to keep it intact and build society around it
Which I agree with by the way
<comment>
men didn't build civilization alone though.
it's precisely your male brain that makes you think they did.
your moid mentality will never allow you to recognize women's role in history bc it only views hurr durr going to war as useful.
you are retarded and i feel terrible for your mother who has had all her sacrifices and devotions to your sorry ass completely forgotten and trivialized. 
this is why if i ever get pregnant it's either a girl or an abortion. men will never value motherhood and femininity.
<comment>
No, I thought this too. Then I decided to look at the media women consume and watched those sappy romance movies and read those romance novels. They don't want violent felons.

you ppl are so retarded and clueless about sex if you think chad just jackhammers.
the reason chad is good at sex is because he actually cares about foreplay and knows how to eat a woman out dumbass.
do you think i would have continuous sex with a man who thinks piv is enough to make me cum? retard.
and male feminists don't exist. men are intrinsically misogynistic and just pretend not to be for female attention.

I'm a man and value womanhood. There's a feminist argument that the construct of femininity is ultimately harmful and restricting to women tho, I think the gender abolitionist radical feminists have some good points about how the valuing of "femininity" can actually come at the expense of valuing women themselves

Go on goodreads and look at the top romance novels and ask ChatGPT to summarize the male deuteragonists of those books.

women don't have to do anything to be attractive and find a man 
so they don't do anything. they develop no virtue, personality, interests etc. because they don't have to.
<comment>
literally.
this is why i tell men who believe this narrative to hop on archive of our own and read the fanfiction women are reading bc you ppl are so delusional and out-of-touch.
they watch porn (made by men) of women being abused and think that's all women want.
<comment>
Can you do that for me? Im jerking off rn bro
<comment>
Well can it be enjoyable if unattractive wretches also care about foreplay, and just do stuff like that without any piv?
And why can't male feminists exist? Why can't we want female attention but also want to /genuinely/ oppose misogyny? I want to be a male feminist even though women will never look at me as anything but a putrid piece of shit regardless of what I do
<comment>
Son of a model with plenty of similarly attractive relatives here. I browse this place for fun sometimed and I got into it because I felt unattractive when I was around 16 because puberty hit my looks very very late for whatever reason. With that out of the way, here's what I wanted to say:
Incels and Chads believe the same thing. Actually, Chads probably disrespect and dislike modern women more than incels. My Dad used to be a huge player that spent years with different women and he still had and stoll has very incel-esque views with "toxic" qualities like over the top jealousy, control over his wife/partner etc. Most of my male relatives are even worse, no incel can top the amount of shit talked about women that a Chad fucking multiple women drops on a daily basis in private. Chads acting differently in public is literally just an act to get laid, just like incels don't spew this shit outside to not be called misogynists or whatever.
Wives and holes are very different and genuinely believing that men don't care about sexual purity or other traditional values in women is utterly delusional and the result of being slightly better than obese virgins which makes you believe you have a superior understanding of modern dating, but you really do not and will never.
eating women out
I've fingered and spent a lot of time kissing etc with girls before initiating anything more but I don't think eating girls out is common, I've never done it and have yet to see someone that has.
all men are intrinsically misogynistic
Yesn't. In the way you mean it, probably since most women are worthless holes to us, but they still love their wives and would die for them.
<comment>
They want their ideal man to have the sociopathic violent behaviours of felons - just not in a felon's body but in a super-attractive multi-millionaire's body instead. They also want him to make a special exception in his behaviour for them specifcally because he "luvs me so much &lt;3 &lt;3".
No woman wants a man who's soft, or even one who's tough but non-confrontational.
<comment>
A lot of the fanfiction I've seen is some really brutal kink/bdsm/power dynamic stuff, often with self insert female characters getting dominated by guys who do a sort of sweet but creepily possessive, "bad boy with a heart of gold" (but in actuality he just has major mood swings and poor emotional regulation but sometimes shows remorse) type of thing. Not really much of the sappy romance stuff. Seems like more of it leans into the "dude kidnaps woman and Stockholm syndromes her into loving her" thing basically
<comment>
Okay. Where do you see violent felon who cheats on her and rapes her in this?

(Of course it's not like girls just magically get into that stuff on their own, there's plenty of creepy aspects of society and culture that influence them in that direction so I'm not here blaming children or anything, but like, the trends for that sort of thing sure seem to be there in the media/fic/etc)

After a lot of obstacles they end up together. Billy beta gets tired of coueting her by way of jestermaxxing and sui himself. Then abusechad and betty sue get married and have sex over his corpse. The end

Both of your examples are "generic alpha musclechad dumps love on some random woman". If you're trying to argue that women don't like "men with roided bodies who disrespect them and try to out-alpha everybody 24/7", you're doing a pretty poor job of it.

Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Isn't the whole point of Reylo that an emotionally unstable bad boy who also does galactic genocide is nice to one woman (Rey) because of, like, some vague vibes or whatever from "the force" and he eventually turns nice for her but only after slaughtering tens of millions of people?
Also looking at a summary of that book...
where rey's a phd student and falls in love with her coworker kylo who values her intelligence and helps her overcome her insecurities.
Isn't she a student and Kylo is a professor? So there's a problematic power dynamic thing going on there. Sure you do have the veneer of progressivism there (or fuck, more than just a veneer) where he values her intelligence, but it's still got the patriarchal bs where the woman can't just go for a guy who is on her level, like a fellow student who appreciates her intelligence? Also Kylo is described as a "reigning lab tyrant" with "six pack abs" lol, why can't the professor at least be a guy who doesn't fit into the narrow six pack abs beauty standard and who has a less authoritarian tyrannical teaching style and more of an authoritative/student centered/humanistic style?
<comment>
Go out in the real world respecting women and see if that lands you in any pussy
<comment>
The whole "highly respected/feared" part gives away that it's a generic chad who "tries to out-alpha everybody 24/7". The only difference is that they make a special exception for the Mary Sue self-insert.
<comment>
Thanks anon for having the patience to expose the fraud chatgptanon was teying to gaslight us with
<comment>
Holy fuck lmao, they post:
"They think women want men with roided bodies who disrespect them and try to out-alpha everybody 24/7."
Then their example of what women actually want:
six pack abs
So a roided body.
"reigning lab tyrant"
And a man who tries to out-alpha everybody 24/7.
I guarantee if you dug into their other examples, those traits would show up as well. The only thing lacking is the man disrespecting the woman, and that's because their examples always have the man disrespect everyone BUT the woman, who he instead dumps praise on 24/7 for simply being a woman with the most generic self-insert personality possible.
<comment>
but they still love their wives 
This is still ultimately the same - for males, "love" for a female is a recognition of utility. The difference between a "hole" and a "wife" is predictability of long-term utility with minimal drawbacks. For example being with a "bitchy" female is too high of a price to pay for utility, whereas a "pleasant" female who serves utility is good results for very little investment.
Likewise a "traditional woman" is basically the best deal possible, you extract a very high amount of utility for very low input of effort/a low price.
and would die for them.
This is not out of affection for the female herself, it is a male power fantasy. The idea of courageous sacrifice is peak masculinity. Be it for one's nation, family, a stranger, etc, it is ultimately an act of self-glorification that has very little to do with one's feelings towards the thing being heralded as the reason for the sacrifice.
<comment>
Hey to be fair tho, they had at least /half/ a point, the book he mentioned wasn't the worst of the worst "creepy adult abducts a female child and Stockholm syndromes her into loving him" or stuff more in that direction, there's something to the whole thing of him appreciating her intelligence, and she's a PhD student so it's, like, still pretty unethical but not quite the same as, like, some old professor creeping on his freshman sci 101 students and grooming her or whatever. As much as it pains my dumb ass to say it, the shitty Reylo fic turned into a book may be progress compared to other things
(But goddamnit it would be cool if women were actually genuinely deep into the feminist stuff many of them claim to like, and just really didn't like that toxic sort of stuff even when it's a bit more "mild" compared to worse alternatives)
<comment>
True, I just commented that maybe that book is progress compared to other worse examples, but even then, if the disrespecting is only dumping praise on the one woman, if anything that can just add to the grooming aspect too, the whole "not like the other girls" shit to separate her from her peers and all that
Fucking bleak

(Plenty of guys don't see women as just utilities and would be fine with the "bitcjy woman" who actually speaks up for herself and doesn't play the role of the "mommy wife" to provide utility - but then those guys tend to be unmasculine unattractive male feminists, and thus are seen as trash)
<comment>
kylo doesn't slaughter tens of millions of ppl he just has mommy issues.
also i don't really like canon reylo because it just seems kind of unnatural that's why you'll see most of the fics written by women surrounding the relationship are spin-offs. buuuttt most of the original appeal (other than adam driver being hot) is that it involves rey, a powerful female protagonist who doesn't give in and take shit from men (do i have to spell out why this would be an appealing self-insert for a lot of women)
and he's not her professor lol, he's just a professor at her uni. the most "problematic power dynamic" is the slight age gap.
"authoritarian tyrannical teaching style" bro lmfaoo calm down he's just a grumpy teacher. it's not remotely that deep.

<comment>
Those men either 1) tolerate it, not like it or 2) extract utility from that in and of itself - they are weak men and seek more aggressive women to compensate. The women settling for them will often not expect much of them and take care of certain things traditionally reserved for men, like doing the household taxes/banking, will work more than the average woman so they don't have to, etc
<comment>
kylo doesn't slaughter tens of millions of ppl he just has mommy issues
I'll admit it's been a whole since I've seen the movies but didn't he literally shoot a giant space laser at the capital planet of the solar system in the first movie? Also he's, like, a space Nazi more broadly?
buuuttt most of the original appeal (other than adam driver being hot) is that it involves rey, a powerful female protagonist who doesn't give in and take shit from men (do i have to spell out why this would be an appealing self-insert for a lot of women)
I get how Rey is an appealing self insert, and not the worst sort in terms of progress and such. The issue is more Kylo, he seems like a bad dude. Even if I'm wrong about the space laser blowing up the big planet what's it called, he was a space Nazi and seemed rather toxically masculine
and he's not her professor lol
Oh ok, I didn't read it
bro lmfaoo calm down he's just a grumpy teacher. it's not remotely that deep.
I mean I think we as a society could benefit from thinking more critically about that sort of thing. Part of making education more accessible and helping cultivate student success can be for teachers and professors to be nicer - retaining an /authoritative/ approach, sure, but not being the grumpy authoritarian sort that tends to be common in some fields
why are you mad at women for liking six packs? bring up your woes with biology and evolution i guess idk.
Blaming biology and education seems pretty lazy. Women don't have to adhere to their physical beauty standards anymore and us men are capable of desiring them anyway, women can do the same with men

It's a two way street. Women murder tradition and so do men, it's impossible to get a tradwife if you're not willing to be a trad man. The big issue is when being a trad man won't bring you a tradwife and that seems to be the case these days. Adhering to tradition is seen as snobbery and something 99% of women aren't willing to do while many guys are and they're mocked for it (Unless they're extremely good looking).

my dad only made like 450-600k a year when i was growing up
why did i have to grow up poor? 
im not joking or baiting, my childhood friends are actually rich (1mil+/year) and i feel poor compared to them
<comment>
what is your definition of growing up poor?
<comment>
not having the things they did
<comment>
you know when bait is bad when they actually have to say "NOT BAIT BTW"

My parents have earned minimum wage all their lives. I was considered to be rich at school because my parents had jobs and my house was really clean
<comment>
no., i am aware that it might come across as out of touch
i am not retarded, im just saying how i feel about it. 
i know you poorfags think 500k is rich, but its really not.

i know you poorfags think 500k is rich, but its really not.
I could probably live the rest of my life with that money. I have very few costs.

stupid faggot
i grew up on a 100k income and we were balling
youre literally like top 5% of people in the world
malding because your dad didn't buy you the ultra mega gigachrome accelerator 50GB customized silverplated exclusive xbox one that your friends got
maybe because he knew not to fucking spoil you and make you dependent on material things even though he definitely had the money for it. get wrecked kid

My father earned like
8-12k a month (after tax), in my country he was in top 1% of the earnings. We mostly had what we wanted and needed, more money would just corrupt us even more, my sister is pretty fucked up materialist anyway. I dunno how much of op post is bait but 600k a year is plenty everywhere, comparing yourself to others moneywise is always a road to being unhappy. Money can buy you many things but not true happiness, they can make it easier for you (life) but i dont know how you can stay mad while your father brought so much money into the household anyway. Youre like my sister while we been on the top of the marina bay sands hotel in singapoure when she bitched about "not being paris hilton", some people have no idea about the real value of money, 4/10 bait made me reply, so 5/10.

i grew up in a gated suburb in the nice part of town with fountains and a pool, so yeah it might not compare to your Connecticut mansions but we were able to survive easily and have extra income for leisure and luxury. and your reply just proved that you indeed did grow up rich 
show some bands or gtfo

It's pretty funny the self mogging people can do when they are low status within a high status niche. People are so vulnerable to perception that you can literally just hack your life to be happy by being high status in a middling status area. Who the fuck wants to be chasing the Jones when you can be them?
<comment>
ok cool
yeah it sucks
<comment>
yeah it sucks
Yup, most of the really bitter people I see are highly motivated, but not highly talented people who become low status in a high status niche. Women are especially vulnerable to relative perception so they hate their husbands for being 'low status' kek. I'd much rather make 200k and marry a grateful 7/10 in the midwest than make 500k and marry a bitter, 'smart' 8/10 in a rich suburb of nyc

Tell me what did you miss? You compare yourself to the others while you totally dont take into account the fact that your fathers earning put him in top 1-3% of the us earnings. You had it better than 97% of us citizens. Its fucking american beuaty "i had to live in the duplex and you have home" or that fucking new chuckie show where everyone lives in 400+ meter mansions in superb condition, have deisner cloths, 1000s of dollars in hobby stuff and still some of them consider themselves as being poor. Its fucking zoomer mentality, you probably have very low self esteem and had terrible friends that used you as a trampoline to streanghten their ego. Youre a mentaly sick materialist, but i think you are aware of that.

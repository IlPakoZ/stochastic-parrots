God.. the amount of threads on the 10th page of anons that will actually anhero is depressing to think about. This board has always been gloomy, but the integration of zoomers and their quirky aesthetics makes this all the more unhinged.

Just pretend to be a girl and your thread will get plenty of replies.

suicidal anons don't upset me that much, but seeing how easily women get love and attention from men has worn on me. they're more valued just for having a pussy than i ever will be.

Yeah, I'm just saying if you're on the brink and have to vent here because nobody in your life cares you might as well do what it takes to get people to listen. You don't have to "drop discord" and end up exposed, they'll still spoil you in the thread and getting stonewalled by people saying tits or gtfo is a thing of the past. I understand people catfishing for emotional reasons, it's complete shit out here for loser men, and you should feel zero remorse taking advantage of brainless simps who wouldn't piss on a man burning to death.

It's very sad, yes. A lot of desperate voices yelling into the abyss.

I'm on the verge of suicide. It is definitely an issue that affects males and it is not hard to see why. Just live long enough (as a male) and you'll see why. Most women are not capable of seeing what we go through. They have their problems as well but male suicide is higher for a reason.
I traveled all the way to a foreign land to get a hair transplant (I'm stuck here in an AirBNB now) only to back out at the last minute. I decided at the last moment that it wasn't worth trying to ascend. No one has ever loved me, and never will, despite making 120K/year and on road to an early retirement. I'm just going to cancel, lose my deposit, and go back home and shave my head. I don't have the mental fortitude to keep trying. The worst possible outcome isn't being bald. It is spending 20K on a hair transplant and still being unable to find a decent partner in 2023. I'm worth it on my own. I shouldn't have to hyper compete for female hypergamy. We are valuable on our own. As men we earn, have stability, protect and are worthy of love. I will start lifting. I'm 6'2" so bald should be a good look for me. I'm also going to get on prep or whatever it's called and just hookermax for a while. STDs used to scare me, but what scares me more is being a pure virgin looking for the same in a woman in this impossible world. Anons always say women should settle for good guys like us but we need to settle too. For us, settling means prostitutes unfortunately. But ultimately all women are.

I wonder how it feels to be wanted and missed
daydreaming about me and Iris kissing in a boat at dusk while multicolored birds fly around us
parrots?
no science in daydreams, just images. but yeah, could be parrots, i really cant tell bc of the lighting and they move so fast
Kidnap someone and feed them everyday. Then, disappear for a few days without feeding them. They will want you and miss you.
daydreaming about Iris and me in Jurassic Park, i'm driving a jeep and she is in the passenger seat, we are running away from 4 enraged T-Rexes. I drive through a cave and we end up in a beautiful canyon full of rainbows where she kisses me and we make out for literal hours.

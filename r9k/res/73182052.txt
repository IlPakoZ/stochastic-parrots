I'd rather take the aiste tranny threads of 2017 than all this garbage.
<comment>
Honestly same. I kinda miss that troon.

Terrible. Mentally ill discord groups spam race bait and /pol/ tier nonsense constantly. That and the constant demoralization threads that are routinely posted on a set cycle. You'd have to be a true retard to not notice a pattern of how often they appear.

Give up on /r9k/. /r9k/ is far past the point of no return. The users don't care about it, only people with an agenda and unironic simps who care too much about fem"bots" come here anymore. 
Visit an alt chan. Even if they're slow, at least the obscurity and greater levels of autism serve as a natural protection against the people who ruined 4chan. 4chan in general is decaying, IS decayed actually.

I just came back a few days ago after years and it's fucking weird. There's women openly posting and more trannies than ever
<comment>
The Discord shit and egirl simping should forcibly be moved to /soc/.

Jannies have given up on this place entirely. Pedo and boylove threads stay up for hours. Racebait and demoralisation isnt counted as racism or trolling for some reason. Fuck this board.

No, you're just a newfag
It's all tourists now, roleplaying as if they belong here, without any legitimate creative writing ability.
Vapid whores who want wallflowers, and losers who self identify as incels as if that was ever a word or part of the culture of robots.
It's disgusting and they should all be banned.

what was the point of r9k originally?
<comment>
It somehow sucks more than it did a decade ago
<comment>
one big gender reassignment brainwash camp, and it worked quite well
<comment>
absolute cancer, just look at what used to be an actual marginal thread even 4 years ago aka drugfeel. 
the normalfag zeitgeist (that includes incelism) is rampant

He said r9k, not /a/. /r9k/ was just a sandbox for an autistic robot that can't stand seeing the exact same shitpost twice in a row.
<comment>
not be /b/

This is honest-to-god art

/r9k/ is an imageboard where there are no exact reposts. 1. If you attempt to post something unoriginal, it is not posted, and you are muted temporarily. 2. The time with which you are muted for doubles with each transgression. 3. Each mute time is 2^n in seconds where n is the number of times you have transgressed. So, your mute time doubles each time you fuck up. 4. Backlinks, eg >>1, are not viewed by the robot. So "lolwut" and ">>2 lolwut" are the same post, in the eyes of the robot. 5. Gibberish at the end of a post to force originality may result in mod intervention (no BLOX posts please). 6. Images are NOT included in the filter, only text. 7. Your mute count slowly decreases over time. 8. You cannot post a picture without text. 9. Unicode is blocked. Sorry, too many exploits (Cyrillic letters, etc). 10. Posts require a certain minimum amount of original content in order to be posted. 11. Post sane, real content, well thought out replies, and mutes are unlikely. 12. The original algorithm was designed by XKCD: http://blag.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-noise-in-chat/
It's almost like there's a sticky to tell you what it is.

I used to post a lot on /soc/ and sometimes here looking for a 4chan gf but overtime there would just be no connection and would just get bored. So now I think I'll just stop posting my discord (for dating purposes) and not embarrass myself anymore, as my discord friend list is full of people I don't know very well.

Nice blogpost, that sounds pretty sucky. However, I don't even remotely feel bad for you given that we've told you fags thousands of times not to waste any ounce of your time on the attention whore roasties on that board

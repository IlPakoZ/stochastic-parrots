I used to post a lot on /soc/ and sometimes here looking for a 4chan gf but overtime there would just be no connection and would just get bored. So now I think I'll just stop posting my discord (for dating purposes) and not embarrass myself anymore, as my discord friend list is full of people I don't know very well.
Nice blogpost, that sounds pretty sucky. However, I don't even remotely feel bad for you given that we've told you fags thousands of times not to waste any ounce of your time on the attention whore roasties on that board
Thx :3
I do have some purely platinic frens so I don't regret all of it.
bumping my shitty thread
why are you bored anon
Idk sometimes I post threads that piss pple off and I thought this would be one of them :(
ill fucking eat you
Never date anyone off 4chan anon. Especially not the girls who use this board.
um thanks?
Is this an inuendo for a blowjob? Cuz in my post I specifically said I gave up!
no
i don't understand this thread. people are not toys
They can be sex toys! :3
you are confusing. and bad at communicating
Shut up you're now my sextoy!

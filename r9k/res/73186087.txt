Is there even one social media that is free of politics, dramas, shillings etc?
What the fuck would you want to see besides politics???
Also, on this site there are different boards, if you are interested in weightlifting go on /fit (/fit is dogshit but you get what i mean)
no, because if those things were banned people wouldn't use it
Social media and internet used to be apolitical (besides mockery mems) until globalists introduced identity politics. Just compare social media posts before and after 2012-2014 to see what I mean.
This here is still as good as it gets in term of free speech ... but that I'm getting banned and blocked because I'm talking about being sick from the vakseen is a disgrace for 4chan.

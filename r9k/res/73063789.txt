HOOOOH SAY CAN YOU SEEEEE
These people just see you as a free walking ATM. Fuck 'em, let their little shit kid die. As you said, not your fucking problem.
haha oh man yeah totally
Should've moved to a downtown mansion that costs 80% of your paycheck in rent, then they would be more understanding of you not having money.
If your family hates you for that they weren't very good family members. Family cares for its own first and foremost.
Kid would probably still die even if you did pay for the hospital bills anyway
Not your kid not your problem mate. You did nothing wrong.
I read that in the voice of Sage, the DJ on Radio X in GTA SA. She has a sexy voice that for some reason gives me a mental image of Angelina Jolie in her prime even though their voices are nothing alike.
Your family doesn't respect you despite you apparently being the highest earner. This is a problem. My advice would be to cut them out of your life, also cut them out of your will and make sure to tell them about it.
This is why I've never told people about how much money I have, I'm by no means rich but I have a lot more money than the people around me, every now and again I'll say I'm broke too so they don't suspect anything

Besides addiction and erectile dysfunction, what are other consequences of masturbating 3+ times a day? Is there anything serious?

Well it degrades your mental health? You are supposed to do it with another person after all,not rape your hands.

I definitely feel like my body needs a break. It's hard to describe, but there are signs like my genitals feeling inflammated or my prostate hurting from time to time. The problem is that within days of starting nofap I get so horny that I could fuck a brand new socket into a concrete wall and it claws at my mind 24/7.

A loss of nutrients and reduced energy. I feel best when I cum once every 3-5 days

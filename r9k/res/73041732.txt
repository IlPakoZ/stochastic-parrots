Exactly how horrifying can we expect the next 10 years to be? As a regular wagie should I kill myself before its too late?

I think it will be quit entertaining to watch. Historians will study about the epoch we currently live in. I for one am curious to see what will happen once all the trannies collectively wake up as to the lie they have been fed. Oh, and I also wonder what will hapen when all the childless roasties (most women in a few years) grow old and have 0 savings in their bank accounts. How high will the suicide rates be? What new horrors will our Satanic overlords come up with? If you ever wondered what it would be to be a character in a dystopian anime, then you'll probably find out.

I can't predict the future and anyone who tells you they can is a charlatan

Considering how irreversible and disastrous the effects of globalism and outsourcing to slaves has been and wage-undercutting and stagnation, plus the sheer inevitability of mass-unemployment, it is only a matter of time that they are forced to bring in UBI and stop this regression to serfdom that has been apparent for the past 15-50 years. Wage-cucking is a fucking scam and not worth the bother.

A wagie doing menial labour? You'll be fine.
A person sitting at a desk? Automization. As it is working at walmart is just soft-UBI at this point. I should know I work there, and have worked in a number of other stores including home depot (night crew usually.) Half the employees of these stores produce...almost nothing with their labor. They are paid to show up and exist/socialise for 8 hours a day. Their presence is utterly irrelevant to the functioning of the store - at most they complete in 8 hours what the most productive workers complete in 1. It kinda feels like im observing the inbetween stage of true UBI when I look at the big box stores Ive worked at; they dont want to just give these people money for free even though if they did there would be very little difference, because they are just surplus warm bodies with no real contribution. Like im not talking about lazy coworkers, I mean people who seriously dont do shit, so much so that there's 0 difference in productivity when 1/3 the crew calls in (so long as we have the few solid guys.)

Minimum wage in leafland is increasing quickly. Almost by 6 dollars in 5 years. That said so is everything else, and its prob long overdue.

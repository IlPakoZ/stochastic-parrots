I think people who talk about being "survivors" and "thriving" are insufferable faggots, personally
I get you. It feels attention seeking. If they were really so well off why would they still identify with the trauma?
My two personal anecdotes
Guy I know from church
Happy-go-lucky, can always put a smile on your face, he's like everyone's favorite uncle. >He hosts dances to get the teens and young adults out and social
Girl I used to work with
Runs the annual BBQ at church
Girl I used to work with
People come to him for advice on everything, he always has encouragement
Girl I used to work with
Get older (known him since I was 4) finally be 14, ask my mom why he has that cool cane and funny glasses
Girl I used to work with
Disabled vet, got a bunch of medals in some war, blinded in one eye, deaf in one ear, in constant agonizing pain from shrapnel and arthritis, refuses strong painkillers to avoid addiction.
Girl I used to work with
He never mentions it
Girl I used to work with
This guy is an asshole

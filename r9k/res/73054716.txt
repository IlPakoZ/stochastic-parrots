I fell for someone, and I'm not sure how to proceed. I feel like I might be too interested in them and it's suffocating, but at the same time, I don't want to fuck it all up as they're a really interesting person. So far, any signs of them showing interest might be mass reproduced to others so maybe I just fell for it. pic unrel

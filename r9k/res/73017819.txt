a real robot, not a failed normie who ended up here, but an actually asocial or antisocial guy, like the kind of guy that hasn't ever been to a party, doesn't have ANY friends, or hasn't had this stuff in years kinda self isolating.
Parties are the IDEAL place for a TRUE robot. It'd be really fun to have a party with most of the people here (though we'd need the staceys). I think actually people would go wild over you at a party. It's a completely different atmosphere socially, and there is a lot of effort to keep guys out of parties. Because basically there's two types of game, there's like social engineering (which the robots don't have) &amp; then PARTY game. Which robots PROBABLY DO have. it's a low-key, relaxed, positive environment, and i'm sure if some of you could get into a party without sacrificing your personality-people would go WILD over you.

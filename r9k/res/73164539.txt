Did she ask the two boyfriends out or did she simply say yes when asked?
How many times has a girl asked you out?

Yeah no shit all the studies done on autistic women even show they are more sociosexually successful than Chad men. Because life's good things are literally just handed to women.

"Introverted" female
has fucked more people than I've shaken hands with
Being "introverted" doesn't mean anything when a femail says it, for them it's just another cute and fashionable label that they can use to pretend they're at least slightly different than the female hivemind.

also:
''i'm so lonely''
''have no friends''
''my boyfriend-''

it depends on the definition of introverted, but you've definitely got to wonder if you'd really describe someone who has sex with a different person every day with the word.

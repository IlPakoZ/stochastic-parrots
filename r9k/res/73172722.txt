I always thought these things were a gimmick, tried an ergo chair and it fucking sucked, but this shit actually relieves my wrist pain holy hell. Probably more relevant to /g/ but I don't really wanna talk to people but robros

Seems like an overreaction to someone having an ergonomic mouse. In my opinion

I really don't see the benefit of this other than the cushioning for the wrists, which a normal keyboard can provide

A vertical wrist position is more natural for the arm, which reduces strain and pain. If you ever need a new mouse, get one that is as vertical as humanly possible. 
Speaking of ergonomic pointing devices, I myself am using a thumb trackball mouse, and I can attest to you that it has done wonders for my elbow pain. Death to traditional mice!

Like I mentioned in my mouse post, a more vertical position is always better. The more vertical the keyboard, the better it is for the wrists. I have not tried a keyboard like in picrel but I assume the sloping does wonders for reducing pain.

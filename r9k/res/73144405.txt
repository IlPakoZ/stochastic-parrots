Jollibee low-diffs all other fast food.
Yeah jollibee is pretty good, possibly the best contribution of the filips to humankind.
Jollibee is fucking awful what the hell are you guys smoking
This. At least in florida where I tried it, it was fucking disgusting and overpriced.
Better than kfc for sure, way more crispy
I've never tried it but I walked past a Jollibee once and it was more than just busy. Had a massive line up and there was security as well. This was in downtown Vancouver though so not sure if it's like that for other Jollibee establishments. Really not into fried chicken so it's not like I'm going to go out of my way to try Jollibee out anytime soon.
Also fuck niggers and fuck jannies.

I've never tried it but I walked past a Jollibee once and it was more than just busy. Had a massive line up and there was security as well. This was in downtown Vancouver though so not sure if it's like that for other Jollibee establishments. Really not into fried chicken so it's not like I'm going to go out of my way to try Jollibee out anytime soon.
Also fuck niggers and fuck jannies.

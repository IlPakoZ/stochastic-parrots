used to have an ugly face and recessed face
spent 22 years as a lonely incel, invisible to women all my life
get double jaw surgery, chin wing osteotomy, upper blepharoplasty, zygomatic sandwich osteotomy, Buccal fat removal, hair transplant, beard transplant, jaw fillers
become attractive to women afterwards
have multiple girls willing to fuck me on tinder
fuck around 3
feel emptier than ever knowing I had to mutilate my entire face to ever get "love"
become a volcel
I have to say normies often say "there's more to life than relationships" and they are absolutely right.

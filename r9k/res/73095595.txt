I'm so addicted to Porn not even the threat of prostate cancer nor the lewdness of chastity can deter my Porn Addiction.

Very based anon. Porn is the greatest pleasure if our time

As do I. Enjoying yourself and being happy is all what you need. Also the discovery what you like, so you have easier time in the future. Imagine you get hooked by some curvy blonde, who would never offer the same sexual satisfaction like cute petite red head. Knowing what you like is important long run.

It doesn't matter at the end of the day, just enjoy life and porn if the porn isn't evil and disgusting (trans, IR, puke, cp, etc)

Cooming is bad for prostate
Isn't it the other way around?

Studies are conflicted.

I thought cooming reduced your risk of prostate cancer.

Anon I...

It does, based of the studies. Not just prostate, but it reduces testicular cancer chance too.

KILL YOURSELF NOW! Kill yourself. I mean that, with a hundred percent. With a thousand percent.

Usually stagnation is bad and causes all kinds of problems (including cancer)
So my money is still on "cooming is good for prostate"

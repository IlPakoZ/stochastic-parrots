God sent Jesus, the savior of mankind. Jesus died for our sins, essentially inheriting all sins of man. His blood trickled through the Earth and cracked the sacrament. He became the antichrist to protect/guide man away from sin and to warn us even the purest (Jesus, God Himself) can turn into a beast if you sin too much.
The ideas of Lucifer and Jesus stem from the ideas of the opposing sides of Venus.

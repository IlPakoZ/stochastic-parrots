How did Satan become the God of this world?
He didn't. That's Christian fanfiction.
In Judaism and CHADslam, only God is the God of this world
based christianity admits that this life fucking SUUUUUUCKS
god is either dead or a very bad manager.
he didnt, both god and satan are part of a fairy tale made up by ignorant desert people thousands of years ago
How does one become this euphoric and enlightened?
God sent Jesus, the savior of mankind. Jesus died for our sins, essentially inheriting all sins of man. His blood trickled through the Earth and cracked the sacrament. He became the antichrist to protect/guide man away from sin and to warn us even the purest (Jesus, God Himself) can turn into a beast if you sin too much.
The ideas of Lucifer and Jesus stem from the ideas of the opposing sides of Venus.
What is this heretical nonsense?
buy a fedora and learn to do sick tricks with it

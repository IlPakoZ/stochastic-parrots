just LARP as the best possible version of yourself. make up a character that looks like you but has the personality you want, then LARP as that character. it's easy to start because you can just say you're fooling around, but if you do this long enough that personality becomes your default

I currently am LARPing as Ben Gates from National Treasure. A guy who can delve into secrets no matter how deeply held for a higher purpose

currently me. larping as a happy cute person with a few aesthetics and my mood is getting better, along with ignoring the insecurities because i can just say im 'not serious'... my mindset is also changing. however, i wanna add more to this.

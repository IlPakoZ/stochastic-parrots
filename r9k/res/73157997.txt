what do you LARP as to help you cope?
I lamp as god. god clearly does not give a fuck about any of the bullshit we do on this planet
I don't LARP but I like to sometimes imagine a happier life for myself.
I pretend I'm a good person.
Same. >Posta orginal msg
Maybe it'll happen one day. Right, bro?
just LARP as the best possible version of yourself. make up a character that looks like you but has the personality you want, then LARP as that character. it's easy to start because you can just say you're fooling around, but if you do this long enough that personality becomes your default

You're onto something here....
i larp as a persona character as it helps me get thru school. somtimes i even listen to the p4 soundtrack between classes to immerse myself
I remember that one guy that LARPed as the guy from Drive for years and totally turned his life around. I may end up doing this myself. 27 Y/O, too late to do this successfully or nah?
I pretend I'm Italian. Or a Buddha.
I currently am LARPing as Ben Gates from National Treasure. A guy who can delve into secrets no matter how deeply held for a higher purpose
currently me. larping as a happy cute person with a few aesthetics and my mood is getting better, along with ignoring the insecurities because i can just say im 'not serious'... my mindset is also changing. however, i wanna add more to this.

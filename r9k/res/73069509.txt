Having Asperger's, ADD and OCD is pure suffering.
You might not have OCD and are just not attending to your sensory needs, thus manifesting OCD like symptoms
Can you originally elaborate?
Please do elaborate kind sir
Try wearing noise cancelling headphones around, dimming the lights, and not doing things that make you feel uncomfortable. I find my own OCD-like tendencies only show up when I'm in a not great space
Is it AdHd if you are super prone to forgetting and losing where you place objects like eyeglasses or not thinking that my peripharal vision sucks?

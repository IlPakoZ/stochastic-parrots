What is the problem with cheating? If you practice safe sex and get tested before having sex with your partner and no children come of it, what difference does it make? Why do people suffer themselves and contain their urges instead of getting it out of their system?
If people got over the emotional part and saw it as something pragmatic, wouldn't this strengthen the unity between couples? People would be less likely to leave if they feel less restricted.

Idk. I would never cheat on my future bf but he is free to do so because I find it hot lol

They would not bother with the liability of a partner at all then.
Either you are fully monogamous and will stick with only me, or you can fuck right out of my life whore

what is hot about it, the fact that he's desirable by other women?

whats the problem with murder
a death of someone can be universally beneficial for everyone who regularly has to interact with that person
not only does me stabbing you result in me getting your shoes and all of the money in your wallet for free, it also frees all of your family and immediate from the burden of having to interact with you daily, thus giving them more time for other things, like having sex with me which i can now pay for with the money i effortlessly stole from your dead body, noticeably improving both of our lives
if people would simply separate themselves from the kneejerk melodramatic emotional overreaction of having a loved one stabbed to death in front of them theyd see logically that it is purely mutually beneficial to allow his murderer to fuck you afterward as in doing so he has demonstrated dominance, genetic fitness and opulence as he is flush with cash and a new slightly used pair of jordans with some mostly unnoticeable red stains you probably shouldnt ask about
literally prove me wrong, murder is good

People generally have no intention of restricting their partners if they don't reciprocate their love. If you want to go fuck others, do so, but not in the bounds of a committed relationship.

How can you love someone if you cheat on them?
<comment>
Yes, also degradation and humiliation part (because I like the idea of him being very mean about it)

But there are benefits to having someone to be the main focus of your intimacy. Like being your default date to events/activities, taking care of each other in emergencies and sickness. But this isn't just limited to feelings either. There are financial incentives too. What I'm visualising isn't much different from a normal relationship apart from that it's open, and not even to the point where that is the central point of their relationship, but if one of them gets the itch, they just get it out of the way and carry on as normal. It doesn't seem like a good idea to restrain yourself of that.
When I hold off doing something I want, I regret it and eventually do it down the line anyway. Sure I lack discipline, but so do many many other people in the world. Surely this would help their relationships if this is something that is easily passed over instead of being another cause of arguments in the relationship.

Murder doesn't happen without causing physical harm. If I met another person that thought the same way as my OP, no one's getting hurt, and if someone does become jealous then they can discuss and either put an end to the open endedness of the relationship or do it in ways that one partner doesn't have to see (although they are aware of it).
I don't get the point of your comparison and I don't think I'd say every single case of murder is morally wrong too.
Both things can occur.

No they cant, love means absolute devotion to someone, chaeting means your pussy is devoted to another guy fucking roastie piece of shit. If you hubby cant fuck you good enough dont ever marry him god I hate women so much holy shit
<comment>
Desire to learn more.
Please describe yourself physically and what you'd like from him in detail.

I think I used the wrong word with "cheating". In my OP scenario both partners are aware, so basically an open relationship but without the centre piece of the relationship being actively looking to fuck around with others. More like if it happens, it happen. You satisfy your urge and move on as normal
<comment>
The idea behind being loyal is building trust. But in modern times relationships aren't even about that, it's more like you just kind of put up with and use each other
<comment>
i hate whoremongers and manwhores, but modern women who fuck around deserve to be childless and perpetually pumped and dumped until the dump outweighs the pump by 1000%
<comment>
Nope thats cringe fuck off :)

I'm not a woman. People can love someone and cheat on them (although I've admitted I've used the wrong word here >>73019633). This isn't even something up for debate. Your definition of love is not the only definition and there's no reason to discuss using your absolutist definition as the basis.

Pretty much, divorces happen because people fall out of love and are uncomfortable with spicing up their love lives.
There's a reason why most celebrities stay married until old age and it's because they regularly have coomer sex swinger parties where they cheat on each other.

People can love someone and cheat on them
No only men can do this women cannot love a guy and cheat on them at the same time because they are subhuman they become hooked to the source of their tingles no matter what. Hence the bulls in cuckold couples getting ludicrously nice treatment from the wife while the husband is treated like dogshit OUTSIDE OF THE BEDROOM
<comment>
Celebrities are sociopaths they cant feel love to start with
<comment>
Wahhh how unfair that I can't have cake and eat it too! How dare you demand discipline
Kys, cuck shit
<comment>
no see youre not thinking about it logically
harm is irrelevant because youll be dead, your suffering is a nonfactor before i even snatch those shoes off your feet, pain can no longer be felt at that point
your desire to live is purely selfish, as ive already demonstrated, as the benefits of your death extend far beyond just myself
see at this point murdering you is not just benevolent, its downright humanitarian, as youre clearly a myopic, selfish coward that cares only about your own wants and wont sacrifice your own life for the benefit and sexual pleasure of both me and surely several of your closest family members
in fact id go as far as saying that you denying this from them and is inflicting far more suffering on the world than my very sharp knife could possibly inflict on your soft, buttery organs, purely by factor of the number of people affected by the sheer self-serving greed of you continuing to draw breath, stealing the oxygen of everyone around you
<comment>
It's a silly comparison, no matter how you try to butter it up. Physical harm has been done to another. The premise of your scenario assumes every interaction with the person you murdered has been a negative for the people they interacted with.

Ah I see. Ironically you are having your knee jerk emotional response to my question of why cheating matters (although, admittedly I used the wrong wording), with the principle being that if people had less things to argue about and felt less restricted in a relationship, this would help the relationship. So now anon wants to murder me :(
Regardless, silly comparison.

Nice, would you try and convince your female friends to fuck him?

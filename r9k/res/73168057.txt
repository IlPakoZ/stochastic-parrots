One last reminder to leave this place because some of you are decent people. The schizo spammers destroyed this place. There is nothing left in this ruin, stop searching. Read a book instead, anything will serve you better than this accursed place.

I have been seeing posts like this for at least ten years. They were probably here even longer than that.
This is the last stop. Nobody leaves here except in a box. Not permanently, anyway.
There is nothing left here, but there is even less left anywhere else.

Okay but where do I go instead?

I came here as a last resort because I felt so incapable of fitting in elsewhere. It's far from perfect, but through the cynicism I occasionally spot a bright spark. And only from that dazzling glimmer can shadows as dark as /r9k/ bloom.

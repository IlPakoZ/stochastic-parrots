I died.
When I woke up, I found myself to not be online.
I could still look at my profile, and my friends, but I was unable to talk with any.
I could still see them though, they talked about me.
They did not talk about me positively at all.
One lived me once, but not anymore.
Another thought I did it for the attention.
I start to look through my mind, to find a reason why I did die.
But my mind is as empty as my current vessel.
That is, nothing.
I miss my friends, I miss them all.
I never even got a hug from them.
And while they do not believe I am gone.
In time, they will realize and miss me as I miss them.
Because I love them.

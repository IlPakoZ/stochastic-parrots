How would you feel?
Nervous because it's my first day working there
happy to be out of the house making some income, and alongside cute grills
I hope I don't get fired I really need the money considering the current job market
wouldn't mind working at a maid cafe if they let me use my mustache and muscles with my shy personality for gap moe

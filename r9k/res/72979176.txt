 I wont date a girl unless shes a virgin
is this the biggest sour grapes cope on /r9k/? 
you realize actual chads dont give a shit about a girls virginity status?
admitting you are insecure about a girls sexual past reveals that you yourself think of yourself as inferior to the other guys shes been with and dont believe you can keep her locked down. its cringe.

Men aren't allowed to have standards!
There, I summed up your little sperg out. This thread is bait, no one respond after me.

I absolutely think this, but I'd still be with someone who's has 5 billion guys down her hole. I'll never be the best she's had, I'd be happy if she has me at all

Well that's because Chad just wants to get his dick wet and hop from woman to woman and I just want to have one meaningful relationship that will hopefully be lifelong and be fruitful with kids and a happy retirement into old age.

..? And her not being a virgin is somehow an obstacle here?

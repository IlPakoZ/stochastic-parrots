Is AGP real? Do lonely men really turn their life around just because of a fetish?
Yes it real, I literally have AGP.
I have masturbated about imagining being female since the first time I jacked off as a kid.
I didn't change my life around for it though. It mostly just entailed not looking at my real body and imagining I'm also a girl when having sex with the gfs I've had over the years.
when I first saw tranny porn at 12, my first thought was
wow they are so lucky to have a body like that, I'm jealous.
I looked at it so much for like a month, until I eventually realized they used to be men and weren't just a naturally occurring third gender, kek
most MtFs are AGP and it's more than a fetish
They turn their life around in hopes of something better because the life of a lonely male is nothing but depression that leads to suicide.
I think most of the time actual agp where your sexually aroused by the idea of being female is something you're oriented towards from your earliest childhood memories rather than something acquired later in life.
Trannies spent ages trying to convince me that they understand me and that I am feeling "gender dysphoria" I know now its just AGP. Have other AGP fags ever had sex with a woman? How does that feel whilst having AGP?
I'm this anon:
Sex has felt good.
The only thing I don't like is I have never gotten to be open with my past girlfriends about what actually turns me on.
One of them asked if she could peg me and another time asked if she could dress me up like a girl and it was a bad feeling having to pretend I thought those ideas were stupid.
Same for me. I just always imagined myself as a girl since the first time I fapped. I didnt transition and probably wouldnt at this point.
But if there existed a magic pill to become a female I would definetly experiment, I just find it very natural at this point.

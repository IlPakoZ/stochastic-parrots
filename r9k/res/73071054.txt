Most problems with focusing on schoolwork are caused by distractions. This is literally why libraries exist. If you are constantly tempted by having easy access to food, media, video games and porn of course you will not be able to study. The solution is to walk to the library and study with physical textbooks rather than a computer which does nothing but distract you. You simply cannot study on the computer without quickly depleting your willpower due to being distracted. You simply can't unless the topic you are studying is something extremely interesting. Even then you will get distracted since physical pleasure will always be more enjoyable than mental pleasure by neurochemical default.

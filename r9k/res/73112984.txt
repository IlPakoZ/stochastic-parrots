I am the owner of a small company. I pay myself minimum wage since I am not allowed to be a slave to myself. I only charge the company for my labor when open to the public, i.e. when we are serving. I was curious about the hours I put in when not on the clock, so I just did the calculation. I bill my company for 30 hours a week, and I work 80 hours a week in total.
Holy fuck, no wonder I have been so stressed. My neighbor came by the other day to Bitch about some bullshit that cannot effect me, and I slammed the door in her face. Im losing it bros. I think I need a break.

Restaurant. Not fast food. Little bit higher quality

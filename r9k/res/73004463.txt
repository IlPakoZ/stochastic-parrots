Okay so I understand that i have to constantly "put myself out there" to gain friends and a girlfriend but where exactly do I put myself. All the advice online seems like if you take a step outside then you'll social life will be magically fixed but nothing ever happens when I'm outside. Do I seriously have to walk up to random strangers for the small chance they become my friend? Help me out here anons It really does feel like I'm missing a step here.
And before anyone ask the places I frequent are the gym, a large park next to my home, a cafe downtown and restaurant that sells ramen. I also have a job but no one talks to me there either.
Ok this is going to be long
then it's up to you what you do
Great advice if you want a social circle full of disgusting alcoholic pieces of shit. Don't go to bars, only trash frequent bars.
So do you have any suggestions on where he should go anon
Gyms are not places where people socialize, neither are parks or restaurants. My best advice for autist is to go to chess evenings or trading card game tournaments. Socializing is comparable to the gym. You gotta progressive overload. Start at the chess club with lite talk about chess openings and work your way up to going to a club or something alone and just chat up strangers. Also gaining friends is simmilar to failing money. Once you have one this Freund can introduce you to their friends and so on.
Seems like a great way to bankrupt yourself

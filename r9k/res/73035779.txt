Won't nag you
Won't beg you for money
Won't beg you to take them out
Cheaper than an escort, pays itself off over time
Why even both with real women anymore?

Based. Even an onahole/pocketpussy is better than bio organic humanoid females

won't give force or audio feedback
won't autoclean
won't auto hide
still too fucking expensive for masturbation with a cold piece of plastic
if one day they make a full body one that feels like you're playing with corpse it might get unironically interesting, until then fucking souless hookers is better

You aren't owning anybody by fucking a sex toy. Literally nobody cares. It's the same with women who think they're owning men because they "prefer to fuck their dildo". It's just sad. If you're genuinely an aromantic person who just prefers to fuck sex toys and finds no value over it to fucking real people, that's good, but posting about it online just makes you look like a coper.

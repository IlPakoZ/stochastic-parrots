Reminder to hide all coomer threads without replying to them. Do yourself a favor. It doesn't matter if you're religious or not or whether you're doing nofap or not, getting your brain constantly bombarded with porn is not good, especially on a board that's not made for porn. The only solution is to hide and filter the threads and deprive the schizo coomers of (you)s.

yeah i do that. same with those rage bait threads where someone posts a half assed twitter/reddit/crystal cafe post along with like two sentences that often doesn't even have anything to do with their picture.

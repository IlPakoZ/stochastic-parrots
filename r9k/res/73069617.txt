don't fall for the meme.
I havent played vidya other than some gachashit in almost 10 years. Back then getting a good PC would always break the bank at over $1000. But now? Im eyeing one of those cheap Optiplex tower PCs, and a 1650. That'd run for like $100-$200 for the PC depending on specs, and $150~ish for the gpu. Sure, you wont get 240fps at 4k, but due to my poor eyesight 1080p 60fps is still more than enough. Finally, affordable gaming!
Too bad I'm old and too tired and depressed to care. Might be a good idea to keep around though.
nigger thats exactly what I'm thinking. I can afford it too, but I know I only want to play one game and money saved is money earned. even if I play the game with friends I know the happiness is temporary.
Building a PC is the endgame for me.
An easily upgradable machine I can do basically anything with. Pirate movies, pirate tv shows, pirate and emulate all games. I'll slap Arch Linux with KDE Plasma on it. Maybe set up a Plex server. I'll save so much money and have endless entertainment.
The big hurdle right now is the initial investment and figuring out what kind of build I even want. I'm pretty cheap so I probably want something budget, I definitely don't want to spend more than 1000 dollars, 800 at most.
you can get a prebuilt with a 1660 super off amazon for pretty cheap
get the gaming PC
I built a new one in 2021 and it's improved my vidya experience
use pandabuy and get a rtx 2060 for $150
Yeah it is. Endless entertainment at your fingertips. You could place me in isolation with a pc and internet and I would be good. Maybe check for second hand components from company liquidations.
And really, only cpu and gpu are important. Memory and ram buy for size not speed, but ssd is really a must today at least for windows.
First time hearing this. Thank you.

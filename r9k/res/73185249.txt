how do I cope with having wasted my youth? My only memories form 12-20 are rotting in my dark room

By letting your future girlfriend fuck big girthy dark cock, dark like your room

my only memories age 8-17 were rotting in my room and my only memories ages 18-23 were being on enough drugs to motivate myself to socialize and do things, or just staying in my room rotting on drugs
still ive decided itd be better tot ry than give up. life isnt here to squander it. some people have to cope with much worse things, like being raised dirt poor and watching their parents be brutally murdered by the taliban

It's good to be mindful and grateful for the good things in your life but guilt tripping yourself into feeling better by constantly saying other people have it worse won't make you any better. There is such a thing as toxic positivity and that's an example of it.

not gut tripping myself just, every time i think my life is bad, it always ends up getting worse and i wonder how i thought i had it so bad
its good to not let yourself get too jaded

I don't think there's a way to cope. Just do opiates until you croak like all the other junkies.

ive done heroin and fentanyl longterm in the past and this really isnt the way to go
make friends, even off /soc/ or something if you need to acclimate into socializing, start doing something you enjoy doesnt matter how bad you are at it, no pressure just keep at it and youll get better, and if you need releif try weed and/or ketamine, but dont mess with opiates or really even alcohol except socially

make friends
I fucking hate people. I really do not a fake quirky misanthrope.
They piss me the fuck off I cut contact with everyone because they annoyed me some way or another.

Why haven't you offed yourself if you're miserable and refuse to fix it?
<comment>
Don't have the balls to kill myself.
There's nothing to fix dumb fuck.
<comment>
there is one fix then. i advised against it, but maybe you really need it. opiates. and if you survive maybe youll meet some cool people in rehab
its not called a "fix" for no reason
inb4 id rather die than be an addict
have fun in hell then

How have you been doing lately?
<comment>
im okay miofren, my pc is in storage and mostly safe....the person giving me issues was convinced im "reformed" and things are stable with me....my next hurdle in life is just leaving when the time is right. 
luckily, i should have a place to stay this summer. back to my life of stress free after work, relaxation, games, and fun. 
also i got a dog.

I'm so glad to hear that things are stabilizing. I wish you the best of luck moving forward! The future looks bright.
I can't wait for summer - for some reason, I feel like it'll be a fun time.
What's your dog like? Is it cute?
<comment>
its very cute, a tan doodle type of dog. she has some separation anxiety though so i find myself cleaning up a mess after work most days.
i like her, but i honestly only said yes to a dog in hopes of when i leave....she will be attached and distracted by it to bother me. you see, i have been getting botherd with the idea of a dog by my SO....i didnt really want one since i work full time, and prefer indoor hobbies...i relented since it wont affect me more than a few months this time though. plus my SO pays for everything related to her
<comment>
Oh, I see. I hope you don't become too attached to the dog either, then. It's a bit unfortunate that the dog is a pawn in this game. I wonder if it will actually have any affect on SO becoming less attached to you?
Has home life been much of a struggle for you?

it may sound drab but....yeah i guess. basically, my SO found a dog closeby for sale and wanted it, this time instead of no i told her as long as she pays for everything i dont care....the dog is fun but its her dog through and through, imjust hoping she can not bother me as much if she has a pet....she mentioned as before but who knows if its true

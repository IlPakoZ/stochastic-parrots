be me
2050
tfw no real gf (the human race was androgynized)
my AiFu powers up sensing my emotional distress
descends from the ceiling and harvests my semen for cloning purposes
it's a mutual relationship
ahhh, life is good
don't have a job
just sit inside and get ZapDrop food delivered to my plate
sigh
look out the window into a stagnant, hazy mist
do this for 100 years
die sitting in the same spot I've sat in for the past 70 years
my consciousness uploads to the Revival Grid transported to a clone
ride the elevator back into my apartment
I'm suddenly now wearing a robe and have a coffee in my hand

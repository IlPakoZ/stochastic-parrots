Everyone that complains about "ghosting" brings it on themselves for being so oblivious. There are warning signs and hints leading up to the break down of the relationship or friendship. They don't just decide one day to ditch you for no reason. You were grating on their nerves for a long fucking time and probably refused to hear any criticism. So if you get angry about it you're just being selfish that the person won't continue to be miserable and put up with your shit. You screech "it's cowardly just tell me to my face!" when you know the core of it is picrel. They just don't fucking like you what more do you need to hear? Ever hear normalfags say TAKE A HINT? This is what they mean

That's typically true, but this time was different. They told me they would miss me, we got along great every time we would hang out.
We talked about hanging out more, they switched jobs, then bam. Ghost town.

People don't have to value each other because they can get all the information and entertainment they want online. People are becoming more worthless, so yeah ghosting is common place when all you can do is give job interview style questions to somehow build a connection. If normies didn't have emojis they'd be fucked.

Ghosting is bad, it shouldn't exist, she ghosted me after 2 years even though I would periodically ask her what I can do better and stuff just trying to keep up because I don't know how to do anything with people

I just painted my nails for the first time and I think it looks good and I'm gonna go to work tomorrow with it on and see what people say. I'm also not gay guys just wanna make that perfectly clear but what you guys think about guys wearing nail polish and does it look good or nah?

Thanks bro it was my first time so you know how it goes
I also got a dark purple color but I wanted to do the black first
If you're gonna paint your nails at least care for them properly. You can't even trim them straight.
Looks hot. Now show me your cock you gay retard.
I try, im not some old korean women over here

im not some old korean women over here

It'll come out better next time :)
Based, hope oyu get your hot goth gf op, evgen if you're basic asf
Thanks bro it was my first time so you know how it goes
it doesnt matter if its your first time, you suck at it so just give up.
YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THE SKILLS
YOU WILL NEVER GET BETTER AT IT
YOURE A LOSER FOREVER
so based don't listen to these anons
boys need to wear nail polish more
It's so nice
I need to get my gf to do mine again it's been so long
I think it looks gay, so will everyone else irl. If you wanted to make that PERFECTLY clear, you wouldn't wear nail polish.
Trimming your nails or painting them? Use a file, dickhead.
Ok deal. You have all of it already. All zero of my monies. I am a neet who never held a stable job. Time to pay up fag.

Uncle anon, do you think the west has fallen? Society has collapsed? It's over?

Thanks to you and your uncle for this good thread. Hard to find these days

Ask him why fats wear their keys around neck like a laminate pass. Is it because they are too fat too reach in to pocket? I see that a lot with them and I was always curious

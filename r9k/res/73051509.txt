I miss my dog. What I really want in a dog is for me to be able to wrap my whole body and head around her and just sort of blood-transmit comfort and trust into their hearts, via soul-trust. But my dog is nervous and excitable. But I still love her

I like my dog because we can play fight and bite my arms and then stop and be totally cool afterwards.

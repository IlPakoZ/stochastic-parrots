Society demands that men bend over backwards just blatantly lying to themselves and others when women serve them:
Fucking sweets
Fucking fast food 
Fucking other shit that poisons you half to death
Our women are fucking killing us with all of their fucking UNHEALTHY FOOD and I'm just sick to death about pretending like it's not happening!

Everyone is doing that. The best food available at grocery stores is certainly an improvement, but it's still deliberately sabotaged by the people who produced it, processed it, and packaged it. I agree with and respect your criticism of women, in fact, I hate women myself, but this is a minuscule part of a massive problem created to profit off of human suffering. Virtually the entire medical industry, including psychiatry, only exists and makes so much money because of how they've sabotaged food and promoted unnatural diets. The problem is made a lot worse with the tens of thousands of industrial toxins they put in everything, which use up what little nutrients we have for the neutralization of those toxins. All "preservative" practices and additives are harmful, all plants are harmful and severely lack nutrients, and freezing/cooking damages nutrients while breaking organically formed ionic bonds and producing toxins. At the same time, the animals we eat are being fed an unnatural diet, they're being pumped full of poison via medication, and a lot of them generally live stressful unnatural lives which makes them even worse as food. All modern mass produced food is sabotaged and you would have to go to great lengths to fully avoid that sabotage

This is either a stupid bait post or you're retarded and ungrateful. Why wouldn't you want to get served by a woman? The fact you're complaining about this means you literally have nothing actually terrible going on in your life and you're just venting about stupid shit. Shut the fuck up and go have your woman serve you a midnight snack or some shit.

who is offering you candy and junk food. also since when is "no thanks, i'm trying to cut down on sugar" not a perfectly polite refusal

i would only offer fast food and candy to a guest if it was part of a calculate insult. even the meanest home made meal is better than wendys

A: I've never seen this happen like ever? If my girlfriend is getting me food she mostly asks what I want, so it's my choice?
B: like others said it's the corps making your food so lethal, don't get pissed at the consumer, aware or not. It's counter-productive.

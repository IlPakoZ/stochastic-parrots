Yeah but I it was some type of bug or digestive problem. Everytime I took a shit it was just brown liquid. One morning, I decided to let out a fart and the brown liquid shit came out. I was afraid to fart for weeks.

yea thats happened to me a few times. but i mean like, you're hanging out and you gotta shit and you start running and suddenly that's it your butthole starts twitching as the sphynx muscle gives out and you dump your pants

About 20 times over the last 3 years. I have fecal incontinence. I can have 30sec-1min between thinking, I need to shit, and I'm shitting.

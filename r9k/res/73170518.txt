I have never seen a zoomer who can grow proper facial hair, and I am curious if it's even possible for them. That being said, most generations are full of people who follow trends, why are you surprised? The zoomer guys here all have mullets (hideous) or the zoomer fade, but that has always been the case. Most people just copy what other people do, only autists and schizophrenics don't.

The real question is, why does every kid in that generation have curly hair?

They don't, it's called a perm. They get it done, unless you think every woman in the eighties also had curly hair.

Zoomed here. It's mostly the annoying chads that get this. 
Yep. I have natural curly hair. It kinda sucks ass

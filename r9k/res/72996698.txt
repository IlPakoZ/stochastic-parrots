So any of you guys preparing? Saving up some money so that when the inevitable collapse of industries happens, and mass unemployment is a thing, I can at least coast along on savings. At least until the govt decides to implement a UBI of some kind. Might as well start working out too, need to be physically strong and prepared for societal collapse and raiders wanting to take your shit.
moar days off
Gotta survive until you get to that point my guy.
I'm gradually making my way. I should have seen the writing on the wall sooner, nobody's fault buy my own. I should have my credit cards paid off by the end of the year, then I can start saving.
GUYS LLMS ARE GOING TO BECOME SELF AWARE IF WE TOLD IT TO AND NOW WE NEED UBI BECAUSE THE SINGULARITY IS COMING NOW JOIN ELON IN THE AI METAVERSE
People who shill AI are miserable wagerats who want to have an excuse to stop working
NOTHING EVER HAPPENS, GO BACK TO WORK WAGESLAVE
Im just waiting for sexbots my nigga
I have no resources to save or prepare for anything. Any world event is the same as a meteor heading for my town. I could get some canned food I guess.
AI and tech is based on a huge misunderstanding between The Autist and The Normalfag.
Tech is supposed to be hardware and machinery and space ships. AI based software systems are folly. The Autist excitedly says "behold, I have automated the lights and blinds in your house and next I shall automate the entire company so we can all do... something else". The Normalfag, ashamed by his brother, can only sigh: "none of this was a problem for anyone".
Tech in its current form should exist in a lab somewhere, not as consumer products.

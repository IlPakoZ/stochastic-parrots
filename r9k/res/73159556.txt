marrying after 30 is as risky as marrying in your teens. the only good time to marry is mid 20s after dating for 5 or 6 years, as per all the evidence.

Why are poorfags not simply taking the money they need from a bank vault? Is it some kind of weird LARP?
It looks like shes just burning through all her husbands money on stupid shit she doesn't need. 
the only thing that bitch can manage is her hair.

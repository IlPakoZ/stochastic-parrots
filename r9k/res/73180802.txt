Male pattern baldness anons: How we holding up today?
I'm Norwood infinity
i have just been planning suicide since balding
Based.
At least it means you're high test.
noo, don't die, I like bald guys
I'm Latino and late 20s, my temples were thinking and topical fin and min had worked at stalling but I just decided to get a hair transplant
About 1700 grafts, I'm now at what I would consider Norwood 1 ish
I just gotta let the months pass for the implants to grow out
I stopped fin and now am using topical dutasteride and minoxidil still
I'm not going bald but I am scared of it. What can I do to help prevent it before it comes?
There are ways to guaranteed prevent it, but you might not like them.
Just gonna shave my head when I start really balding
Hair transplant in two weeks and I just got my braces on for double jaw surgery, hope I die on the operating table desu
Gave up a year ago. I was already ugly so it's not like it mattered. I'm considering getting SMP (hairline tattoo) but half of them look like shit/obviously fake. Lots of pics of 40 year old white guys that somehow have the hairline of a 19 year old Dominican
literally why if you just explained how silly it is
I have a boobs,dont grow any facial hair(besides some on my neck) and wide hips and im still balding.(norwood 3)
Half of them look terrible, but the other half look pretty decent if the hairline is made to look natural. Like a norwood 2 buzzcut
i wish i did this. hes smart.
You wish you cut off your balls for your hairline?
Thats retarded.
yes and started rubbing estrogen on my head. then again at that point it might just be better to get a wig. i will never spread my balding genes though would rather have no nuts than no hair. 
sexuality is a burden anyways. the downfall of man.
Hair is serious business.
Hairloss forums are filled with guys dosing themselves with female hormones because fin didn't work and they can't accept living with baldness.

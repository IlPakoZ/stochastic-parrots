Mostly stuff bought with the kit. I'm a madman and tumbled the lapis and quartz with harder stones, but it's my first time anyways. That large quartz in the upper part of the photo is one that was taken from its natural habitat.
We have already established that I am a madman with my own evil goals. The protests of anime posters only make me steal more rocks from the outdoors to perform my heinous acts upon them.
that blue one
Lapis Lazuli.

I'm fond of agates and tiger eyes.
Don't be ridiculous, how would you even tumble mica?

I only like gems that are all of the following:
1. Sharp, polished faces
2. Vibrant colors
3. Translucent

You would have to be truly past the point of no return to put a rock up your butt. It could shatter inside your rectum.

went on a date
later my grandmother (who I live with) asked, and i quote
"did you have fun with her? or him?"
I was so taken aback I just spat out: "I had fun with HER".
Also my parents gave me for valentines day a card with a raindbow heart on it. 
I posted my face on r/amIugly and they asked if I was a FtM tranny.
why the fuck does everyone, even my own family think I'm gay when I'm a straight man

You should just accept that you look like a faggot tranny and buy in.

Chill out. Who cares. You managed to go on a date, which is more than most sorry SOBs on here.
If you're not 15 or something, just know that that's the hottest type of man.

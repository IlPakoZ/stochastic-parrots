When is the last time you hugged someone that isn't family and that is your age? I hugged a mutual friend about 4 months ago (cousin's gf friend), and I'm still thinking about it. Brutal.
Almost 10 years ago now, it seems.
I do not think I have ever done such a thing.
I have only ever been hugged by family members, and I have never even attempted to initiate a hug with anybody.
I hugged a friend of mine a couple days ago. He's in a relationship he really needs to get out of and was venting about that. 
Before that, it would be my ex. Broke up with her a month or so ago, but social/professional stuff keeps us interacting. She's definitely more broken up about it than I am and asked me for one, and I obliged.
5 nights ago. Before that it had been 1 month
I dont remember its been awhile
who fucking cares tho 
accept it wont happen and move on. youll be happier

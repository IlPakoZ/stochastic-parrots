Why is talking to girls so scary and nerve-racking?
<comment>
Because they are deciding whether or not to accept you as a mate which is even more intense than a life or death situation.
Salmon swim upstream beating the shit out of their bodies just for a chance to secure their mates.
<comment>
Because women have hurt me and made fun of me in the past, so every interaction is a game of cat and mouse where I need to navigate whether this one will hurt me and if it's even worth the risk since if I get too close and fail the pain will be even more intense

A big dog might be sitting there waiting to catch it and eat it though
<comment>
I imagine strangling and fucking every woman and feminine man I meet.
<comment>
it's not though. i once was scared of talking to girls, but i slowly came to realize most girls are utterly useless, uninteresting, don't match with me and are not what i'm looking for so i just don't bother
<comment>
I must say I do find the biological purpose of shyness to be a bit of a mystery
through natural selection, shyness should not even exist
<comment>
Because they are deciding whether or not to accept you as a mate
what if you're talking to them as a friend without any hope of mating?
<comment>
because they are judging every minuscule aspect of your entire state of being at all times. thats literally all they do
<comment>
Rejection feels like death, and in a way it is if you let it be. If you try long enough something will click.
<comment>
I dont know anon. I never been able to manage having conversation with one before. I avoid them whenever possible.
<comment>
I've wondered the same thing. It seems like genetic suicide.
<comment>
shyness is a product of capitalism, as saint kaczynski wrote
<comment>
You'll get used to it anon! Just think of them like talking to any other person.
...honestly I get nervous too.
<comment>
talking to boys is way scarier
<comment>
Because you're a simp that puts pussy on a pedestal
<comment>
I'm meeting with a girl today for a date and my heart is pounding way too heart. I almost feel like throwing up. Oh my god why can't I just be normal this is physically painful.
<comment>
Chances are you have insufficient or negative experience with women that you carry around with you in the form of prejudice, anxiety and idealization. Girls are humans just as you and I. They too suffer from doubts, self-loathing, naivete, ignorance, etc. Once you realize that there is a basic humanity in everyone which makes communication across culture, gender and any other perceived boundary possible, everything becomes much easier.
<comment>
because autism makes you blind to 90% of social communication, you are aware of this, yet unable to fix it, and the stakes are high because rejection is utterly soul crushing and near completely unavoidable

Women have no reason to be insecure unless they're exclusively going after Cha-- oh wait
<comment>

In a non-civilized setting it would be your adrenaline kicking in and making you pounce on the girl and put your babies inside her.
In a civilized society that's sexual assault so instead you sit there feeling all that adrenaline as nervous energy without an outlet.
<comment>
In moderation, a community of slightly shy people is going to be more cooperative and productive. It's just another trait that's evolved out of control because we live in such large societies.
<comment>
lmk when you get out of your silly little paradigm and stop alienating women because you cannot contain your envy and lust at your failure to achieve what you view as your right taken from you by external factors. It takes introspection, which you've proven yourself horrendous at if you don't realize your inability to talk to women is yours and yours alone to work on, but please do try

through natural selection
natural selection
niggers and pajeets are literally the ones breeding the most on the planet right now
<comment>
why would it be nerve wracking, what the fuck are you talking about?
<comment>
how is it nerve wracking lmao
<comment>
You've never once felt nervous when you're alone with a cute girl?
<comment>
If you're a shameless ass with no ability to think introspectively then yeah there's no stress when talking to women.
<comment>
when I was 12 and I had to ask this one girl out yeah, that shit was nerve wracking. But I was a kid, you learn that shit either works out or not, but you're the man so why give a shit if it doesn't? Her loss.
<comment>
Ok buddy. Some of us are not mentally well and highly neurotic.
<comment>
and why would their opinions matter so much that id be ashamed to talk to them based on that? lmao
<comment>
This is true. In high school and college I did so many drugs that even though my natural state is to be a high anxiety beta male who cries and wants to be hugged I ended up getting blowjobs and fucking random girls at parties and basically not having thoughts.
Also get into cocaine even if you don't use it yourself and you'll get laid a lot. Coke is like catnip for women.
<comment>
A woman typically isn't going to sleep with you if her opinion of you is negative.
<comment>
shit dawg in that case, yeah I presume it would be nerve wracking to talk to women, and people in general really. I was assuming the question was for regular not mentally ill people. Mental illness can make shit like taking a shower difficult.
If you go into a conversation with a girl you want to fuck or otherwise seduce not already thinking you're the shit and she'd be lucky to have you, then yes you're going to be really nervous and maybe make mistakes.
If it's a woman who I just want to be friends with then there's zero stress or nervousness, same thing applies too, she's lucky to be talking to me so I act like it. Same attitude with men. I don't put people down either, I just like who I am and people mostly like me so it's cool, those few who don't? Well can't win em all I guess, their loss.
<comment>
but they wont know if i dont talk, and i wont talk if i consider them as scary as you do.

my ex boyfriend broke up with me when i had to move away when we were young. i was upset about guys trying to mess with me. i didn't realize i might of hurt his feelings when telling him what was going on.
he told someone years later he still missed me. i'm super sad about it anons i recently moved back, what do?
<comment>
if you have any thoughts besides "have sex with him" then don't even bother
<comment>
Unless he's a socially retarded autist he has had his fair share of experiences with women, just like you have with men.
He wants to fuck. Simple as. If you value the validation and pleasure you'll get from fucking him more than the heartbreak you'll feel when he inevitably dumps you again, go for it baby. Personally I'd do it, but just because I liked the way my ex fucked, I really don't want to be in a relationship with her.
<comment>
I like trannies but internet talking makes me even more nervous than talking to someone in person.
<comment>
I am an extremely average man. I get no romantic or erotic responses from women. I looked at a guide for how to tell if you're ugly, mid, or chad, and it's all in the initial reaction of women when they see you just watch their facial expression. If there's a slight muscle twitch of disgust in her face, you're a sub 5, if she smiles or laughs for no reason at all, you're a chad, if she just does nothing and gives the fluoride stare, that's mid. That's me. No reaction, no attraction, no repulsion, just invisible.
<comment>
i would have sex with him
heard he's a lot more introverted now. guess it just makes me sad thinking he doesn't actually still like me for me as a bonus to the sexual aspects...
<comment>
How the fuck does anyone have enough self-esteem to think like that
I'm afraid to talk to girls because I worry they'll either correctly assume or mistakenly think I'm attracted to them and be repulsed because I'm an ugly sperg
<comment>
I can GUARANTEE that if you hung around with me for say 4 months you'd learn how to have some confidence and self-esteem.
inb4 im still ugly won't get me anywhere.
Bitch, what would you rather be an ugly motherfucker with zero self-esteem, or a confident ugly motherfucker with high self-esteem?
I'm not some sort of god tier gigachad either so it's not like I'm confident because I'm attractive. I'm average looks, above average at best when I get ready to go out. Picrel.
<comment>
Would you be confident if you lived with your parents, looked below average, and couldn't hold a conversation
<comment>
then do it :D just msg him and see if he's happy about you coming abck
<comment>
Probably not as much? I do live with my parents though.
Still, no matter how fucked up your situation is, confidence WILL make it better, you just need to find the things that make you feel confident and powerful I guess, for me that's music, partying and exercise. Doesn't mean it's all that I like, I also like nerdy shit like competitive pokemon, skyrim modding and DnD. It just doesn't give me confidence y'know?
<comment>
Natural selection doesnt mean the "best"(from our view) or "strongest" genes survive, it means the ones that manage to reproduce are the ones that survive. Africans and poos popping out 15 kids a pop not worrying if 10 die still yields 5 kids, meanwhile europeans and east asians are popping out 1 or 2 a piece with many not producing any despite having higher raw intelligence and physical health comparatively
<comment>
How are you even getting laid then
<comment>
 music, partying and exercise.
Both parents work so I fuck in my house during the day, pay for a hotel at night because I don't bring a girl home with my parents still there unless I want her to meet them.

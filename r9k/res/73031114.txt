How can I tell if my "friend" is in an emotional affair with me or if he's just larping/joking?

What does that even mean? I get it if it's a romantic partner, but a friend? Do they just confide in someone other than you?

Well, we usually dance around the line of what is acceptable, but I am sure his girlfriend would not be happy if she saw our messages. However, the other night I had some wine and got a little more daring on one of our regular RPs and started getting more overtly sexual. We sexted from there. We've known each other around 12 years, been friends on and off the past few. The thing is, if he were actually attracted to me, he would have dated me when he had the chance but he made excuses. Therefore, all our flirting and sexting might all be a joke on his end or charity for me.

I feel like such a femcuck desu, but simping him is better than simping some other men.

He seems like trash and you seem like trash too. Might as well grow some balls and make passes at him, the poor girl he's with deserves better and the two of you don't deserve anyone better than each other.

Too bad he will never love me. He would've by now.

Is he in a relationship with some other girl? Why are you calling it an emotional affair
<comment>
I mean, he said it was monogamous. If he is serious about the sexting and finding me attractive, what else would it be?

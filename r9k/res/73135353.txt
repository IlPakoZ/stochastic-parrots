To Women,
I resent you for always trying to denigrate me and for making me feel unwelcome, demonized and like I'm a 2nd class citizen and don't have the right to set up male spaces or talk with as much abject prejudiced sexist hatred as you do all the time. I hope you realize someday you were always a morally defective hypocrite and the entire problem.

To Anon,
You know something, there's something obviously demented about you. You have to be on some level a completely unhealthy fuckup who doesn't totally like yourself either if that's what makes you cum.

To Anon,
It is a me problem. That's why I write about it like an emotional schizo. I have https://youtu.be/i1ojUmdF42U [Embed] And cry about my feelings on the internet. You know what makes you a freak though? That you choose to read and respond to this pretending like you don't care. And it's all because you're a terrible person, unable to control yourself and looking to get back some sense of self importance by obviously failing to sound like you're impenetrable or above someone else. Anyone you can find and justify to yourself. You need a very lame and arbitrary justification to ignore the obvious impulses of malice and insecurity that drives you to act this way towards anyone in the first place.

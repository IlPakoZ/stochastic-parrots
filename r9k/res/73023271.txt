Good is everything I want in a person (THE perfect package), but I'm not attracted to them (she's pretty, but idk). Talked to her for months. Nothing was there, but I want it to work so badly. 
Bad chick is everything I hate in a person, but I want her badly. I crave her every day. 
I hate this so much. Logical side wants Good. Animal side wants Bad. I'm in turmoil. Falling into a deep depression over this. Both sides of my brain are screaming at each other. It's ripping my psyche to shreds. I wish I could transfer my love for person B into person A.
Why does this Creator torture me so? 
What the fuck did I do to warrant this hell?

why not just date person b? attraction is much more complex than that and cannot be rationalized. it's like trying to makes sense of a wave in an ocean.
<comment>
Cause she's a slut. I want wife material.

but like i said

sometimes you can think something won't work out, but that's only because there is no physical information to come with that idea. you would be treating them more fairly if you just leaned into your feelings

4 reasons I hate sluts:
1. I'm not a beta cuck that wants sloppy seconds 
2. It hurts me to be attached to someone that has been used because all I'd think about is how another man rammed them 
3. It shows they weren't loyal (for instance I save myself for marriage because I want to show the person I marry how loyal I was to them and I expect the same for my future partner) 
4. Pic. Sluts = high divorce rates
Logically they make no sense to marry, yet I want to marry her because something about her drives me crazy.

people were meant to follow animalistic desires to a certain degree. like i said, you would be treating them more fairly if you just tested these emotional beliefs instead of simply ideating about them. it's unfair to both, especially person A, otherwise.

Alpha fucks beta cucks. 
True for both sexes, except people call "madonna whore complex" in males.

I have to jerk off to get my mind off it, but I get horny a lot which triggers my sadness, so I need to drain myself a lot throughout the day just to get her off my head momentarily. Can't even nofap since huge build up causes my heart to ache more in sadness for not having a lover. 
Person A... it must be her, but I don't want to cause her pain. I must create attraction for her somehow

What does your gut logic say to do?
<comment>
My gut doesn't answer me. I might have to ask person B out just for closure though. I'm hoping it helps me get her off my head, but it also feels like a bad idea because she's genuinely not wife material in my eyes so if it "works out", I'll be cursing my life.
<comment>
My instinct would say person 1. Are you just not attracted to them physically at all? Do you dislike something about them?
<comment>
I guess that person A is a bit on the skinny side so no shape. Also like 4'10" so desu kind of not a woman figure. Very petite basically. Other one has curves and like 5'3".

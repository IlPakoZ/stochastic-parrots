My friend is so attractive he legitimately has girls stop him to talk about his job as an uber eats driver. Like he's somewhere picking up food to deliver and girls stop him and try to start a conversation about fucking uber eats. I fucking hate women.
i can't keep reading this shit. I'm going to fucking end it if this keeps up
Can you post a pic of a man with roughly similar looks? Sounds like he's a true gigachad (9-10 range) but I need confirmation.
Yeah. People who say this doesn't happen are coping. It literally happened to my friend. This bartender came up to ask "us" about our jobs and wouldn't even let me get a word in edgewise. Not the first time this has happened either. Sorry guys. The truth is you really just aren't attractive, myself included.
mad that your friend is attractive
you're a shitty friend and you deserve to be ugly since you obviously are on the inside
He looks like the beards and bikes guy from youtube.
When I lost a ton of weight this happened to me too I'd just be at the store and people would start talking to me for no reason it freaked me out at first until I realized they were drawn to me. Now I'm fat again and nobody speaks to me or makes eye contact with me

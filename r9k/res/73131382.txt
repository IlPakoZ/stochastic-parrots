It's one of my favorite ones to get off to but I've never seen a girl who has it as her favorite too
Im wondering if there is one I can meet
<comment>
I like 3d monster hentai. Especially if there is animated cum mmm
<comment>
I like it too and bestiality as well, is that one of the things you masturbate to the most?
<comment>
drop discord and maybe ill add
<comment>
no it's soulless.

kokkoro#2210
you havent look at enough of them
<comment>
No, it has no sense of eroticism, expression, passion, or life. It is truly soulless compared to some of the drawn porn I've seen.
<comment>
I agree with this anon. It's soulless, but I'd be interested to see if you could provide a webm to prove me wrong.
<comment>
not OP but I can prove you all wrong with this https://twitter.com/WALLIMOG/status/1579120905070219265

Whats the point if I cant have sex with it irl? Porn does nothing for me. I will wait until I can get an irl sexbot husbando with a vibrating dick.
<comment>
No, I watch 2D hentai sometimes but 3D hentai just exaggerates the unrealistic things about 2D hentai and makes them uncanny.
sexbot husbando with a vibrating dick
You have a crush on Connor from D:BH don't you
<comment>
women literally have no reason for sexbot, you want to ban them because youre afraid of losing attention
<comment>
but 3D hentai just exaggerates the unrealistic things about 2D hentai and makes them uncanny.
am I the only one who finds that hot? I love robotgirls because they can be uncanny as hell too
<comment>
people who dont like 3d havent played enough 3d fighting/horror games or overwatch
<comment>
Untrue. There are women who would rather deal with a robot than a real man much like there are men who aren't incels but would rather deal with a female robot rather than a real woman.
<comment>
just get a mirror
<comment>
Are you kidding? I would kill for a realistic sexbot husbando. The moids I want are completely out of my league, but I am still horny for them. A walking, talking, realistic, at least semi-sentient android bf built in the exact likeness of my famous crush is literally my dream.
<comment>
men who want robots :actual companionship and someone to care for them
women who want robots : jealous ugly girls who want chad instead of the 800 chadlittles at their disposal
it speaks for itself
<comment>
No I don't want chad, I want a literal robot boyfriend because I can't relate to real men. I just don't see any reason to interact with a real man romantically or sexually even if he is a 10/10. I don't want to be loved by a real man.
<comment>
Saddest boob physics I have ever seen.
<comment>
why cant you relate to guys femanon
<comment>
I think I used poor word choices, I can relate to men in some ways because I grew up in male spaces on the internet talking to men anonymously over shared interests and discussions it is very relaxing, but not in a romantic sense so I cannot interact with a man as a woman (in you know, that way). I just don't want to be loved intimately the idea is foreign to me, not in a negative way, instead I like fantasizing which is why I have crushes and like fictional characters. I dislike culture wars between the sexes from the perspective of an outsider.
<comment>
boobs that size dont jiggle that much
<comment>
people actually jack off to themselves in the mirror?
<comment>
you are just a virgin dude
<comment>
what's so strange about that?
<comment>
Males. Moids.
I can smell your smeg from all the way here. Through my screen. Moidy moids.
<comment>
wgat do you mean by that lol
<comment>
nobody replied
he fucking won
<comment>
capcom and square games have the best ones
<comment>
I would rather incels have the opportunity to screw a bot than continue killing innocent people, although I'd rather live in a civil society where said people get mental help and those who don't that commit such atrocities get the death penalty automatically. Also, if I could have a sentient android like pic rel I would never deal with a human male again.
<comment>
He is Stacy only. He would develop free will and leave you for someone thst actually deserves his mechanical cock
<comment>
a water bottle filled with BEES!!
<comment>
He has no genitalia, anon. That's cannon.
<comment>
see
roboriginallly
<comment>
That's okay, once chad shows a faint level of interest in you your opinions will immediately 180.
<comment>
requires you to log in to Twitter
I don't have an account, am not making an account, you have proven nothing and I hate you.
<comment>
You know it's weird, when I'm fapping every day, looking at a gif like that would instantly get me hard and ready to fap, but having not fapped in several days I watched it loop a few times and didn't even experience the slightest twitch of my dick.
nobody replied
No shit he linked some shit you can't see. And we're not making fucking twitter accounts.
<comment>
dont act like most people here dont use twitter
<comment>
Most people here will click a twitter link or bring stuff back that they found on twitter but not post there or make an account. The lack of replies you got to a link that requires an account is pretty telling.
<comment>
I want to live a ordinary and quiet if anything that threatens the lifestyle I want the most. I do not want the love of any man there is no point. 2D boys are better in every way anyway.
<comment>
Based I support all men and women in their bot love endeavors.
<comment>
yeah these guys are just being a bunch of whinners
<comment>
Yes! This isn't really an origin story, but I was going down the rabbithole of doa content because I wanted to try out some cosplay makeup of the various girls. It didn't take too long to eventually find porn of it but I honestly thought it was pretty cute. I wouldn't consider cg nsfw my favorite but I do appreciate how easy it is to find and how there's so much of it.
<comment>
Wanna share me some of your favorite ones ? I got into that a lot aswell due the DoA girls >>73131851
<comment>
Guys are always gonna be the ones buying the most robots
women cant be lonely
<comment>
yeah, studio fow kunoichi has been my no.1 fap material for years now (along with erotica). i don't bother with most 3d hentai though because i don't like the really short ones (very common) or the very badly animated ones (most common).
<comment>
share me your fap material femanon
<comment>
i just mentioned an example of it lol
<comment>
i want some more examples just dm them
<comment>
dm? I barely use instagram
<comment>
I didnt mean instagram, i meant discord
<comment>
the final fantasy 7 remake cast made me fall in love with it
<comment>

<comment>

<comment>

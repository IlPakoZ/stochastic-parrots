I have a nice face and I fitmaxx and dress well but I'm 5'7". I get looked at by girls all the time and I can literally tell the instant they realize I'm a manlet because all the interest just disappears from their face and they look away. 
When are short men going to be euthanized? We can't do anything about our height and it's a natural part of the INITIAL screening process of sexual selection.
i know how having a normal body feels like because i get the fuck stares when im driving. roasties look at me like if they were getting wet. the minute i stand up its over.
sometimes i fantasize about getting my two legs amputeed, maybe i would be regarded more as normal than i am now
I know exactly what you mean. When I go try to put myself out there sometimes girls will approach ME if I'm sitting down. They will stare and stare and it's very noticeable and I can actually see them just move along if I stand up, it's so fucking brutal I can't do anything.
Yep I know that feeling. 
I've considered buying lifts. Sure, I'll look comical with 3 inches tucked into my shoes but I already look comical.
I'm 5'8 which is around the 30th-40th percentile. 
I wonder how much of an impact adding 2 inches (via lifts) would have in these situations. 5'10 is still not tall enough for most women but it would firmly place me into the average category.
what the fuck is that supposed to mean. it reads like youre invalidating him but your pic literally proves him right

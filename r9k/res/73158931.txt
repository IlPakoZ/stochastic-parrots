just learned my ebf is 5'7. am i wrong for cold blocking him?
Yes, kike. Kill yourself. I hope you get cut up ruthlessly
no, no woman is genuinely attracted to short guys so you did him a favor. he needs to learn. did he bring anything to the table that could compensate for being genetically unlovable? money? fame?
may the inflamation of your heart be eased
we are both 19, so no money and fame is possible yet. i don't care about it that much. but people should not gatekeep their height as if it's not the most important thing.
Short women blame short guys for being born, but will still reproduce knowing deep down that they will likely create more short guys.
DON'T FALL FOR THE DEMORALIZING PROPAGANDA
i prefer men to be 5'0-5'10, men much over that just seem scary
no, that's fair. I'm 6'2" and I'll be your e-bf as long as you're not fat

just learned my ebf is 5'7. am i wrong for cold blocking him?
<comment>
Yes, kike. Kill yourself. I hope you get cut up ruthlessly
<comment>
no, no woman is genuinely attracted to short guys so you did him a favor. he needs to learn. did he bring anything to the table that could compensate for being genetically unlovable? money? fame?

may the inflamation of your heart be eased

we are both 19, so no money and fame is possible yet. i don't care about it that much. but people should not gatekeep their height as if it's not the most important thing.

Short women blame short guys for being born, but will still reproduce knowing deep down that they will likely create more short guys.

i prefer men to be 5'0-5'10, men much over that just seem scary
<comment>
no, that's fair. I'm 6'2" and I'll be your e-bf as long as you're not fat

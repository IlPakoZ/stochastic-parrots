Anyone have any experience with therapy, did it help you feel better?

i went for a while and it changed nothing because i have real problems and they can't be solved by talking to someone for one hour a week

It didn't help much, because I know what I need, but I'm too scared to do what it takes to get better. 
If you want it to work, be honest and open to your therapist's suggestions. If that doesn't work, then maybe find a new therapist.

I went for 8 years, changed my life. Im not kidding. I have significantly, SIGNIFICANTLY improved the course of my life, relationships to others, and daily functioning. Just gotta find a therapist who is good for you. And 90% of therapy is what you do outside their offikce, you know?

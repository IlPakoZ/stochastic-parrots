There's this girl in my college class that I set next to and I think that she is really pretty, but I don't know how to approach her and ask her out. Should talk to her after class? Should I use a pickup line or some sort of joke or something? I've never actually asked a girl out/for their number before so I have no clue what to say or do.
<comment>
Just don't dude. Study harder so you forget about it.

asking that on a board filled with people who have never asked a girl out 
How did you get into college you brainlet?
<comment>
Have you not realised by now that this is probably the least incel board on 4chan? Incel threads are burried by sex haver threads and posts. There is one incel thread up and everyone is laughing at incels like the normalfags they are. I still won't recommend taking advice about dating from anyone because you already failed if you have to ask.
<comment>
I thought that /r9k/ would give me better and more realistic advice than places like reddit, where they tell you to just be yourself and shower.
<comment>
You dont. Women will approach and pursue you if they find you sexually attractive.

this. 
Women WILL make it very obvious when they like you. If they arent:
1) smiling at you 
2) staring at you 
3) going out of their way to talk to you
Then you're just wasting your time.

Ask her a question about the class, classic ice breaker for lectures
<comment>
Learn your place. This is the part of your life where you think 
One day I'll be rich, and all the women will love me
so one day you can be in the 6 figure range with a tech job crying
Women only love me for my money

I have asked out toilets before. I always get rejected and she will also reject you, just being real. What you do though is just ask her if she wants to hang out some time. Remember, this is real life, not a based zeus video, so no need to be overly specific with the details. Pls no jestermaxxing, no pickup line, no predditor tier "le hey this is randem xD but you're cute :3", etc. You've already comprimised your dignity enough by asking her out, no need to make it worse. 
Also, remember:
I'm busy
I'm going to a birthday party 
I have corona
I'm going to my secondary home
mean
get away from me you creep
<comment>
I have a friend that looks exactly like that Choijack on your pic
<comment>
which one, left or right? the left one is totally someone I see everywhere in public, a common look
<comment>
Yeah I probably will get rejected since she's kinda out of my league, but I want to ask her out just so I don't any "what if" thoughts later on and waste time thinking of a possible relationship.
<comment>
Wrong. Women will explicitly ask you for sex if they find you sexually attractive. They are not subtle. That is just cope for ugly men.
<comment>
Sorry anon. She is not into you. You are just setting yourself up for humiliation.
<comment>
The proper sequencing is that you first attend a group social event with them. As the event goes on people leave, but if she's into you she will stick around.
From there you have a social context to follow up at a later date and say that you had a great time and want to take her out sometime. Offer to pick up and drop off, this gives her social context to invite you to stay over, which in turn is social context for some degree of physicality.
Also, show up early rather than approaching them late. People have plans for what they're doing after class, and talking to them at that point is an annoying interruption. Before class you know that they've got nowhere else to be and might appreciate the idle chatter. The start of class is for hellos, the end of class is for goodbyes.

I did this, sat next to the same girl in lecture for a while. said, "hey so i was wondering if youd want to go on a date sometime." She said, "oh sorry im not looking to date right now"
<comment>
No what you're thinking of is /pol/ dude, this place is normie fucking central nowadays.
<comment>
Correct. The notion of "dating" and "first dates" is as antiquated as any other piece of courtship wisdom. You're implying romantic or sexual intentions to someone who is practically a stranger.
People don't date, they hang out. Eventually they start hanging out alone together, then they fuck. If you're exceptionally attractive this happens all in the same night. I'd wager that the majority of sexual encounters literally happen BEFORE the first date. (as in going out somewhere together). People meet in public/at a party and then get invited back to one person's place to hang out alone together.
<comment>
Right one, but with his face slightly flat
<comment>
I thought of this, but the class we're in, English, is pretty easy and I feel like if I were to ask her a question about class I'd come off as a retard.
<comment>
Well the secret is to not overthink it. Just ask a question related to class and go from there. If she seems receptive maybe something along the lines of "am I crazy or is ____ super fucking hard?" 
You can just bullshit it and either way it goes you can spin that into "would you want to study together sometime?" 
That's the easiest way to do it for someone you've never spoken to and only see in class. Outside it's obviously much easier.
I used to smash gash all the time I'm just too mentally ill to keep up with the loop at this point. I mostly don't care anymore.
<comment>
Kek that's only happened to me with literal whores like strippers or roasties approaching/post wall. Normal women aren't like that at all.
<comment>
implying /pol/ isn't also normalfag central at this point
It's full of former redditors and retards that watch fox news. They larp as oldfags and claim the board was always just fox news 2. 
This whole site is doomed.
<comment>
This is why it's seriously as simple as studying with her. Of course with that strat you've gotta build up to her place/your place if you can't immediately jump to that step, but that's the easiest and most normal way to get alone time.
<comment>
I really value that man take me out to something really simple first, asking out like a Cafe or a park, go on a walk after your class and try showing interest on things that she values GOOD LUCK ANON :D
<comment>
hey, did you get professor Suchandsuch's extra credit question right?
She replies, you make conversation briefly and you say 
I'm, Anon by the way
She'll give you her name
well &lt;female>, there's a place that makes great bubble tea, I'd like to take you and talk more
Is that so hard?
<comment>
You mean "higher-value women", and you aren't getting them because you forgot the D.
<comment>
How do you ask out a girl?
Consensually. If she's not interested, then even asking her is a violation of consent.
<comment>
Haha, she already has a boyfriend, OP. All the decent girls are taken.
<comment>
If she's not interested, then even asking her is a violation of consent.
I don't think that's how consent works
<comment>
Sorry anon but you must be ugly, then. It is a daily occurrence for attractive men.
<comment>
It's easy to tell someone is an actual loser with no friends when they say shit like this simply because it shows they have no real world experience. At the very least you don't interact with higher tier guys and thus obviously have never made these sorts of observations in real life.
Even if I'm not a 10/10, the implication is the guys I know that are gigachads have this happen to them every day and I just never see it? Even though it's a thing that happens every day? 
You're seriously either delusional or trying to demoralize the autists on here that don't know any better but are trying to crawl their way out of this shit. Either way, kys faggot. You're a blight on this world and since you're powerless in other ways, you target the poor guys on here.
<comment>
If they do not get approached then they are not even Chads. I did know some Chad's and they were approached multiple times a day. They expressed in private it happened so often wherever they went that it was really annoying. Plus, the constant sexual assault women commit.
<comment>
She is 99% already sucking and fucking don't bother
<comment>
LMAOO +1 second this. picrel is op getting cucked while she's confirming dick appointment with chad.
<comment>
Yeah, but there is a 1% chance she isn't so I still want to shoot my shot
<comment>
Unless she is showing actual interest in you, don't. Chances are, if you're on here, you'd probably be needlessly embarrassing yourself - just being real.

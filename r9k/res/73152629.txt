<comment>
One of these posters is a troon btw

<comment>
Imagine someone spending the time to find out more about you and then using that information to intimidate you. It's fucking wrong. This company needs to go. Their reputation is gonna tank after this.

What did you boys do today? Me? Went to the beach, got some pretty excellent rocks, enjoyed the vastness
<comment>
The pretty rocks (and bonus shell)
<comment>
lovely rocks those like
<comment>
Go to /brit/ if you want 100 posts a minute
<comment>
Did fuck all really. Hungover as fuck. Helped my dad do some things in the garden though. Couldn't let him do everything himself. 
I haven't been to the beach in years, but I'd like to go at some point soon. I live in a coastal city and used to go all the time as a wee lad. Good times were had.
<comment>
Cheers lad am quite happy with them like. Need to collect some more and finally use my rock tumbler. One thing I didn't realise about tumblers is that you have to leave them on for fucking weeks to get crazy cool looking rocks at the end, but I guess considering they're effectively speeding up millions of years of erosion and polishing it's fair enough really. 
Brutal as fuck that is lad, you need a spliff and a few cans of diet coke and maybe some rocket lollies too, that's sort you right out. Get yourself to the coast lad, the air genuinely fucking blows the ald cowbwebs away

<comment>
I've got a problem. I'm very demanding with people's company. When I want to meet with friends etc, and if they say they're busy it'll infuriate me. Like as if I deserve their time. My parents were loving and always had time for me as a kid, even now. Where does this come from? Come on - someone diagnose me
<comment>
It isn't a low, a low would be bragging about eating a Burger King all by yourself. You do at least show some self-awareness so that's fine.

What is there to be optimistic about? What is there to look forward to?

Poached eggs for brekky, quick trip to Tesco for beers and BBQ stuff for tomorrow (weather permitting), took the dog out for a long walk near beachy head, 
poked some sealife in the rockpools, didn't hurl myself off the cliffs, quick pint in cuckmere on the way home, had some arancini for dinner and played a couple of games o ticket to ride while watching the garbage film buddy games. Now having a nice whiskey before bed. Thoroughly nice Sunday, looking forward to whatever tomorrow brings me.

What are the lads up to for the coronation next week? There's a street party on my road so might check that out, however it was a particularly grim affair on the jubilee last year, flamboyantly gay teenager running children's games while the gammons drank cans of stella. Apparently there's one about 10 mins walk from me that has a DJ, so probably a less depressing bet, but likely I won't bother with either.

For NO FUCKING CLEARLY DISCERNIBLE REASON to boot

Is it good? Does the PS3 have analog triggers for acceleration and braking?
The game disc is the important bit. 2.50 is pretty damn good. It's crazy how much video games reduce in price over time.
I picked up copies of Halo 1 and Halo 2 for Xbox from CES a couple years ago, I think they cost 50p each, or maybe Halo 2 was 75p, can't remember. But still, what a fucking bargain. I played them on my Xbox 360.

Fellas, I'm absolutely fuming. Was supposed to meet my best mate for drinks but he ignored all night so I spent hours waiting around the area for him, only for him for grace with me a text acting ignorant to it even though I texted him and gave him 10 missed calls which I know he got.
My new girlfriend (very new) lives near by and didn't text me for hours and then then went to bed after I told her the situation - obviously didn't vent too much, but man am I fucking fuming. I'm known by everyone I know as the chill cool dude who takes everything in stride and as a result no one truly considers my feelings. It's horrible and I'm so upset I feel like I could cry. Holy shit

I sleep in a cheap king size bed, cos that's what my landlord left me, and it'd be awkward to bring anything else up the stairs. For two years it's been fine. But lately I keep having dreams about holding someone as I fall asleep. Cuddles and all that, their arm draped over my chest, a head in the crook of my shoulder, their leg resting over mine. It's nice, and as I wake up I can almost feel their soft skin against my hands, the weight of their body against mine, but then the illusion drifts away from me and I'm alone, and my eyes adjust to the off-white paint on the ceiling, and all I can hear is the sound of passing cars.
<comment>
This is how my current relationship started, we are due to be engaged this summer.
Weight can be lost (on both sides), bad looks cost cash to fix.
Hope it goes well fellow chad
<comment>
Bit ironic that the bipolar gold-digging whore gf drove me into infidelity with her shit now
When i was assuring her that i'm not cheating she wouldn't buy it, now she's had one nervous breakdown too many and i actually dgaf anymore about being "faithful" or any such memery
Truth be told she's probably been fucking at least 3 guys or so on the side while seeing me too
Like LOL, no way in fucking hell is her actual body count three guys like she's been claiming. Her pussy is roasted-out as well and shit, defo gonna do at least one HIV test down the line too/pretty soon

Lets collectively repent to Germany for what we did to them in WW1 and WW2
We can admit we couldve done things differently and war couldve been entirely averted and everyone couldve been saved
We couldve also made it all far less bad, we are as responsible for the genocide because we tormented the Germans and they were basically just surviving 
I do not condemn wolves for fighting anything and anyone when things could be infinitely better and they do not see many options

I don't want to rent, and flats are very expensive (especially if you avoid leasehold and shared ownership scams), and I'm perfectly happy with my crappy car.

Not him but, you need to find a trustworthy homeless person (not from your city or town), and get them to go and pretend to be you. Get a spy kit, get them to wear the glasses with a camera, and an ear piece, then you can instruct them on what to say.

Yes, she'd forgot to open the curtains, so couldn't see.

Unironically yes. I didn't think they could see your security questions. I use password managers so hate it when security questions are required.

Being a shut-in racist is just a waste of time
Non-racists actually have children, while shut-in racists have none, because they never leave their smelly bedrooms.
<comment>
Racists tend to have more children than non Racists, and the more extreme your beliefs the more you're likely to have.
On the far left end of the scale everyone believes its immoral to have children due to climate change

Why? does he post on /britfeel/ or something?
<comment>
He's just turned incredibly weird and unreliable, a proper shut in and needs everyone to do everything for him. He has no ambition to do anything. I'd cut him out my life but I don't have anyone else really
<comment>
Everyone I know that has 4+ children is racist. There are loads of shut in racists on 4chan with children, although you tend to find them more on /pol/ than /r9k/
<comment>
He really doesn't like chuds, they wind him up good and proper
<comment>
Wish I was as happy as SSM
<comment>
Your fantasies aren't real, you know that right?
Everyone I know in real life with children isn't racist. And every racist I come across is a shut-in 4chan poster.

The local 'just don't like em' chav family doesn't count lad
Why not?
<comment>
I wrote the first post you linked to
It's not cope, it's true. I know multiple people in real life with children, and none of them are racist. The only racists I come across are the shut-in incels on 4chan, who obviously have no children.
<comment>
Because he's thinking of the le epic blood and soil families
<comment>
My best mate is similar. He is very negative, unsupportive, glass half-empty sort. but we've been friends all our lives and he's this way because he is hurting. I don't want to cut him off but damn does he drag me down sometimes. Plus, same as you I have no one else so I'd be completely alone most days without him.
<comment>
Sounds almost identical. He's mad at the world for not having a job, he's been out of his masters since September and had no bites from interviews - but that's normal. It took me a whole year to find a job after my previous one and that was intense applying etc. He also ignores my messages when I know he's on his phone, they're only simple requests to get him out the house. And another thing is that he has all these girls interested in him but he's pushing them away because he thinks he worthless. It's fucking stupid. He needs to get a fucking grip of himself. He's older than me too
<comment>
I hope he sorts himself out sounds like he has a lot of potential. I was in a similar place myself until I got a decent job after uni, it took me a while to find it though. Having a purpose in life and feeling valued is honestly one of the most important things. Sometimes it takes reaching rock bottom (or close to) to wake up and feel the need to continue fighting for a better life. I believe it can be done no matter where you're at in life.
<comment>
You're right. I was in a similar situation to he is now a year ago. I was at my lowest point and cut contact with friends because I felt worthless. Now I'm working, got a girlfriend and feeling like a bloomer. I my friend who listen to my advice

Remember a couple of years ago there was all this hullabaloo about a lot of stabbings in London. 
Has that gone down now after covid or has the news just moved onto other shite? 
Anyone here from London?
<comment>
From London, it's still really bad. It's mostly (basically all) kids killing other kids. Can't tell you why exactly, but I would guess that it's a mixture of the fact the kids have nothing to do, workwise or socially, a culture of drill music (poor scapegoat imo) and that these kids are so miserable, have no futures and so just live their lives on a knifeedge
<comment>
Why are tickets so damn expensive?

Mostly black, some white (poor kids)
Like I said bro I can't explain it all, just can guess at it
<comment>
It's obviously blacks. I'm sure you can cherrypick white examples, but it's overwhelmingly black. Very little to do with 'no opportunities' and excuses like that. Its because blacks are genetically more inclined to violence
<comment>
Does that mean whites are also genetically more inclined to be paedophiles?
<comment>
Probably, given how rife it is here

I'm in my early 20s and have just started touching grass
what route should I take to socialmaxx?
go back to uni solely to make friends
move to a big city full of young people and make frens though hobbies/events/gigs/nights out
backpack through SEA or Latin America, make friends with zoomer locals, travel through countries on a motorbike
I'm leaning towards options 2 and 3 but I have this massive paranoia/FOMO about not being able to meet long lasting friends or get a GF unless I'm in a university 
Is uni really worth it for the social aspect if I'm in a city full of young people where events related to my interests are constantly happening?

Leave NATO, use our troops for Britain
Segregated schools for those that want them
Higher pensions for those with 4 children
Road tax to be ringfenced for road maintenance
Discourage cycling, issue free rail/bus passes for those that scrap their bike
Restore pride in our children, sing the national anthem every day in school
Better cartography, put Britain on the map

What underwear do you lads wear? I wear exclusively Calvin klein because they're always good quality - had pairs since I was 16 and I'm 24 now that are still in top shape. 44 quid for a 3 pack though. Worth the investment I'd say. It's a shame other clothing companies like Next have the name on the waistbands like that. The CKs I have only have one CK

HIS LIFE SO MUCH BETTER GAMBLE FREE
He done stopped the gambling. He gone thirteen years ten weeks no gambling. People say how did he stop? End of the day, gambling is a mugs game and you have have a shit life. You end up losing your relationships and family and children but SSM got no family no children. His darkest days of gambling in the past now he moved forward, he doesn't live that side of life now.
He'd rather spent that 50 quid at Curtis Butchers and get some top quality food. Best cider for him. He'd rather go pub and save money from gambling so he can go get a trekkie brekkie.
His life so much better gamble free. He an inspiration to so may fucking people. Just love SeasideMark. He's changed my life. He help me make right choices in life. It's a lovely. It's you that's need to stop. All the counselling and support is good in a way but YOU have got to STOP. Oh he so wise. Its a lovely.

Before putting any clothing on I tucked my penis, it wasn't difficult, I used regular sellotape instead of medical or duct tape. My outfit consisted of an orange/red down jacket, great sweater with pink trim, black t-shirt, dark blue ankle jeans and white trainers. I felt good about myself and I was proud of how flat my front was. I listened at my door and timed my run to leave the house without anyone seeing me.

Oh, he was like that on /deutsch/, too, back in the day
He eventually warmed up to an Austrain larping as a pilot and told him all sorts of personal details late at night, which a couple of months later led to his doxx

And a shorter night. 
May the 10th make it good, 
On the promises made
Just like it should. 
May the 15th give no cause, 
To look back 
At long-closed doors. 
May the 23rd be so kind, 
To the faces with smiles 
That they lined. 
May the 31st feel fulfilled, 
About the hours
And days and minutes killed.

Garn grind some Warzone 2 for a bit before beddingtons. Might have a wot woodle anarl who knows. Only me I suppose lmao. Just thinking, imagine if Russia drops a cheeky nuke on Ukraine sometime this week, the coronation is basically fucked. I mean, it might still go ahead but nobody in the world will give a fuck.

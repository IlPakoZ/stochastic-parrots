This is why I gave up on dating.

It's not like you're growing up and you meet a girl your age for the first time. Everyone has history and expectations now. It's harder to find common ground when you'll always be a stranger with no previous connections.

I gave on dating because I am a shallow piece of shit and would leave any person who shows genuine love to me if they become fat or ugly. I dont deserve to be loved or whatever fiction we believe in.

pissed all my friends off
talked to nobody in college
sit in room all day, sleep majority of it away
been like this for nearly a year now, I don't know how to fix this. I have forgotten how to hold a conversation and every time I try I end up bringing up something odd or offputting or I just choke up on words and cease communication, even with someone who I just want to be friends with and have no romantic interests in. Something needs to change, I know that much, but I have no idea of where to start. All I do is sit sleep and think.
Anon you're literally me
Anyway you need to get a hobby, start playing an instrument or something idk. Dont force yourself to be social if you dont want to, its really not that bad just listening to music and vibing in the corner like an autist. If you dont want to do that, then you should start talking to people online. Just make a discord account or use omegle or something and start talking with random tards.
I don't even care for hobbies, I guess I just want someone to socialize with.
I tried the meeting online route but I can never trust anyone that I don't know in person for some reason, also all those things feel so forced and I end up blocking after a day or two.
Do you think it would be a good idea to try and make amends with my previous friends by any chance?
same bro. what college?
I concur with >>73098032
except don't vibe in the corner like an autist
Dude not even random discord tards like me. I get ignored in every server
You've gotta learn to be alright with the situation you're in.
Find hobbies you're into. Pick up the guitar, go on some more bikes, try modelling or reading. 
The easiest way to socialize in my opinion is sports. Force yourself to watch a popular sport team at uni. For me it's hockey, I've struck up quite a few conversations just because of the jersey I wear. Still no friends but that's more due to a chronic sickness.

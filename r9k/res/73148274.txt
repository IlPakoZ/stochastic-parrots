To those of you that were teenagers in 2000-2009 but are still a KHV in 2023:
How the did you make it through that decade without at least making out with a girl? I was a fat, soft, weak, short, poor, high-estrogen low-T homeschooled faggot (still am but now I have GED now instead of being in homeschool lol) and I still managed to kiss lots of girls and even pull some tail back in the day because women were just a lot better to weirdos back then as long as you weren't whiny or bitter. All the 00s alt girls were saints: emos, scene girls, punks, goths, weebs, Invader Zim fanatics. You had to actively avoid sexual contact with some women back in the day because they would aggressively try to jump your bones and would be very upfront about wanting to fuck around so no mixed signals. They would usually make the first move, you know?

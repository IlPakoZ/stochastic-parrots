You lower you standards and settle for a man as ugly as you. It's time to stop chasing men out of your league and if you can't hack it then maybe you should kys

Didn't you already make this thread less than a week ago? I remember because I already responded to it as an ugly woman and told you that you don't need to be beautiful to have permission to exist as a woman. I exist unapologetically. I don't cry over what I don't have or waste time trying to be fuckable

If it's just your face that's ugly, focus on your body. Get boob and butt implants.

You're probably being far too harsh on yourself. Also this is the worst place possible to ask this

Depends. Are you just a normal heterosexual guy eho happens to be ugly, or are you a hyperfeminized soijak?
if it is the former, just see a hooker and you will feel better. if it is the latter, you can become a paypig so you can have an "emotional"(kek) connection

how do i get over the fact that i am an ugly woman? too broke for plastic surgery and idk how to do makeup. should i just kill myself?
Become an SJW and twitter activist
You lower you standards and settle for a man as ugly as you. It's time to stop chasing men out of your league and if you can't hack it then maybe you should kys

By getting a bf you dumb bitch it's not hard just open your legs.
honestly ur right
Didn't you already make this thread less than a week ago? I remember because I already responded to it as an ugly woman and told you that you don't need to be beautiful to have permission to exist as a woman. I exist unapologetically. I don't cry over what I don't have or waste time trying to be fuckable
If it's just your face that's ugly, focus on your body. Get boob and butt implants.
i tried, its just my face or something
i have boobs but no ass
i dont remember desu
Even ugly moids all want Stacy
You're probably being far too harsh on yourself. Also this is the worst place possible to ask this
Depends. Are you just a normal heterosexual guy eho happens to be ugly, or are you a hyperfeminized soijak?
if it is the former, just see a hooker and you will feel better. if it is the latter, you can become a paypig so you can have an "emotional"(kek) connection

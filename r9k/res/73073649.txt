Made for giving handjobs

Had it all my life until I got the surgery. It's hell and totally fucked up my teenage and early adult years. Now I'm free but the damage is already done and I'm still a khv in my 30's. If you have access to surgery just do it

i have paper towels at my desk always because my armpits secrete snail slime and ill ruin my shirts otherwise
i do ruin my socks but theres nothing i can do about that really

i had a friends who had this. It was always annoying when we played vidya together because he'd get all the controllers sweaty

Had a friend who has this condition when I was younger. We held hands (as friends) once and her hands were sweating profusely. It makes me feel awful because in retrospect knowing she was probably afraid of me makes me sick. It's amazing how you can't have a single normal interaction when you're ugly.

ive been with girls and when i grab them from the waist when fucking a few said "ew"
im 32, i still cant touch no girls hands willingly, everytime a person touches my hands i immediatly back off and get red and start doing weird shit
it fucking sucks i clean on my pants at work and they get all hard as if i nutted on them
when i was a kid this happened very often and they wont want me to play anymore because i "damaged" the controllers
it feels really awful like pure fear and horror for us sweaty hands, sometimes im not even nervous they are just sweating
feels like shit bros its over for me anyway in my third world ass country there is nothing like a surgery for it and if there is i probably die inbetween the operation due to stupid people

Yeah, not quite as bad as that pic, but just enough to be annoying and noticeable. It makes playing guitar a real bitch, rusting up my strings in no time.

You're full of toxins and your body is prioritizing sweat for detoxification. Every "solution" the medical industry offers is harmful and doesn't address the cause of the problem. Eat animal products with minimal additives and minimal processing. Lots of butter, eggs, and meat. No more medication, drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes. Take hot baths for 60-90 minutes at a time and keep the water at 102-105F. Even better if you add 3tbsp epsom salt and 3tbsp raw apple cider vinegar to it, because then you'll neutralize some of the toxins they put in municipal water. If your head gets too hot, put your hand in a bowl of cold water for no more than 2 minutes at a time and dampen a rag to put on your head. You should probably sip milk during it since you'll be sweating even more than usual and losing some nutrients

I worked in a processing plant that had to be be heated to max Aircon temp for the product to be in a liquid state, plus it was in an iron clad building that heated up in the sun.
I never sweated much before that but after 3 months of that constant heat my gene expression adapted and now I drip sweat even after a quick jog.

Lmao take your meds schizo animal

I sweat like an animal under my armpits and it has a lethal smell. God forbid i dont wear a shirt or allow naked skin on skin contact, literal drops of sweat start rolling down. Its a real nuisance but at least im healthy af because whatever enters my body gets expelled immediately.

Let me tell you, as someone who went through both sweating a lot and being unable to sweat at all. Just oversweating is a cosmetic problem. Be thankful every day to God that you are able to produce sweat. When you can't sweat it's like you are burning if you are in a hot room, or God forbid in the sun during summer. I went from being very active and into sports to burning after doing just 20 pushups. It's so rare that a doc straight up said it's impossible. Suposedly you can only be born without sweat glands, but it happened to me mid life, who knows what caused it. Somehow it went away on it's own. 
Too much sweat >>>>>no sweat at all
<comment>
im like the complete opposite, my hands are always super cold, like to the point my hands are never sweaty unless its summer

My dad had palmar hyperhydrosis, made him extremely insecure, never had a gf until 36. Couldn't cure it, even my grandpa who was a doctor couldn't do anything about it. He then found my mom who cured it using Bach flowers, crazy shit.

I have what OP has and I can barely tough my girl's privates, the salt that's always on my hands stings her too much

Splotchy is a word. Just add an L to whatever the fuck you said and you're golden.

why are strippers uglier now compared to the 80s, 90s, 00s? (all fat black or latinas with fake tits) 
why are prostitutes, hookers and escorts uglier now compared to the 00's, 10s?
why are pornstars from the mid 2010s to present, uglier than the ones from the 80s-early 2010s?
why is hooters hiring girls with small tits and push up bras?
Is it really because of Onlyfans and Tinder?

millenials don't do stripclubs like they their parents used to, porn is free, and if you want a personal experience onlyfans and cam sites exist
t. stripped and did cams when finished high school

yeah
cute white girls figured out they can become porn gigacelebrities or some millionaire's sex toy, instead of shaking ass in some shithole bar

they probably make less and cater to a lower clientele also its so easy to get pussy now if youre the type of person who used to go to a strip club that it almost seems quaint

why should anyone value the opinion of a 50 year old man who frequents strip clubs
<comment>
why
There was one type of attractive woman in the 90s. Skinny, white, big tits. The end.
That's what you saw in movies, commercials, posters, Playboy, everything. With the rise of the internet, you see much more diverse tastes pop up, wider acceptance of "whatever", and now every mish mash of women can be considered hot by someone.

It is because of nostalgia for jacking it to the girls who did porn when you hit puberty who are now likely old and wrinkly.
Riley Steele, Kayden Kross, Shawna Lenee, Madison Ivy, etc. for me. They did not age well but I still like the old vids

if a girl bumps into you alot or rubs against you consistently at a concert does that mean she's interested? I went to a concert and this really cute girl was rocking back and fourth bumping into me

Depends on context, she could just be a klutz or is just stupidly endowed
Or she just likes seeing men's reactions.

She has drunkenly mistaken you for a chad and will run away after sobering up a bit.

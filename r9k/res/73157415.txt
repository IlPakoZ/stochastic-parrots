It's a drowned rhetoric nowadays but life's so fucking unfair.
I treated everyone how they wanted to be treated
I was kind, compassionate and have done what I can up to this point
I fell beyond all of them and have to drink myself to sleep and swallow meds just to keep reality at bay
It's so fucking over

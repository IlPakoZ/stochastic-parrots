Nicotine is the most disgusting thing.
If I even smell smoke out in public, I hold my breath and try to speedwalk around it so it doesn't get in my clothes whatsoever.
I hate thinking about it. It's vile smelling crap from the depths of hell.
People legitimately breathe it in, hold it in their lungs and just stand there in a cloud of this stuff. Like 10 times a day.
Their lungs start turning black, their teeth start smelling yellow, their breath smells vile.
It gets in and on literally everything around it. Their clothes, the walls, the things they own, the people around them. They literally live, breathe and become smoke.
Fucking deplorable. If anyone ever tells me that they smoke even moderately, I'll avoid them like they told me they were radioactive.
You are not smelling nicotine, it's odorless. You're smelling other things in tobacco.
*Obnoxiously coughs cigar phlem in your face*
What you gonna do pussy? Cry? Pee pee ur panties?
Have you tried weed edibles yet?
No smell, don't need to learn how to roll a joint or use a bong, no damage to your lungs, just swallow em and have fun
Breaking: autist vastly overreacts to mildly unpleasant stimulus. After this break: he'll tell us about trains!
What a coinkydink yes I just took one
I started smoking weed like one year ago. It's been a hoot but yes I absolutely hate the concept of smoke so much that it almost stops me
You gotta be careful when taking drugs as an autistic person though, because everything is generally more intense all the time when you have autism
It took me a few weeks for it to even be fun, but I figured out how to manage myself and keep myself happy

tranny online girlfriend
It's Over
<comment>
I've seen her pics. She started HRT before puberty and she looks decent.
<comment>
No, it's not normal. Why do you care if it's normal? Does it not being normal ruin the relationship? If so you're retarded and should've known this wasn't normal from the start.
<comment>
then what's there to feel bad about? are you infected with right-wing propaganda or something like that
<comment>
Lmfao you faggot loser
<comment>
It's OK, anon. That happened to me too.
It's too tempting how they're girls except they actually talk to you and are nice. The penis part is unfortunate but there isn't really much other option and it's still better than going full prison gay since they have female secondary sex characteristics at least.
<comment>
tfw I instantly recognize the exact tranny in this pic just by seeing the balls and the out of focus hair. 
Yeah that's Ella Venus isn't it
<comment>
It probably is, I just searched for a random tranny pic
<comment>
Both cis and trans girls can be nice anon. And anyway, a lot of people like both vagina and penis. Though most trans girls don't like it if people like their penis.
<comment>
Can confirm. My gf hates when I acknowledge her penis.
<comment>
trans girls hate the part that makes them special 
Don't get me wrong, I understand it and I have empathy for human beings so it's not like I feel like its my right or anything but it truly does suck that trans girls hate their dicks and don't want you playing with it.
I'm not a bottom, but if I had a trans gf I would certainly want to play with her dick a ton, give her blowjobs and handjobs, frot and stuff. But knowing they hate all that makes it depressing and not hot, that's why I've never tried even dating a trans girl because they'd just end up hating me for finding the dick hot, not like I don't think of them as people outside of that, but I'm still into the dick.
<comment>
I have a gf
Then you're a normalfaggot. Simple as. You were most likely always a normalfag.
<comment>
you mean normal girls and trans girls
<comment>
Though most trans girls don't like it if people like their penis.
an absolute tragedy
there is no justice in this world
<comment>
Imagine if your gf was making threads saying "can't believe I have to settle for an online bf". Your relationship is dead in the water.
<comment>
Then literally what is the fucking point?
Thats the one thing that makes men want them over regular girls because it's different
<comment>
It's normal for a straight guy to feel a bit conflicted about a trans gf.
Doesn't necessarily mean they're going to have a bad relationship. His gf could have picked a guy who was less fully straight if she wanted but she probably preferred having a regular straight guy and this kind of initial uncertainty and discomfort is the tradeoff to doing that.
<comment>
he is commenting on the erelation is shit part
<comment>
It's not the only reason to prefer trans girls.
I don't like penis and just find trans girls easier to talk to and connect with.
A lot of them are similarly autistic and into anime and video games and I just haven't found that same kind of personality among the cis girls I've been intimate with in the past.
<comment>
It's fine to be conflicted about it, though I humbly doubt he's straight, but saying "is it over?" with no other thoughts isn't really anything thoughtful. He doesn't respond to anyone saying it's over and he's only replied twice I think ITT. Him saying "she looks decent" doesn't sound very enthusiastic like I'd expect for a good relationship. 
Maybe I just have an amazing relationship but I can't imagine doing anything like what OP is doing even if I feel very conflicted. Maybe I'd say "I'm quite worried about X thing coming up/in the long-run" or something but not to imply I'm in a dead-end situation but I'm gonna stick with her anyway.
<comment>
OP here.
It was a rhetorical question. I know it's over because I'm 29 and I'm in an online relationship with a transgirl. If it were an irl one that'd be different. I think I'm in a pathetic position objectively.
<comment>
Do you guys think a tranny would be ok with being in a relationship with someone who sees them as a failed male? Asking since it seems yall have tranny gfs here
<comment>
Well that's what I presumed, see >>73065148. You're a total normalfaggot but you take your gf for granted and spit in her face.
No self-respecting trans girl would ever accept that except maybe in the bedroom as some fetish thing.
<comment>
self-respecting trans girl
<comment>
You will never be a woman. Cope l, seethe and dilate
<comment>
If incels are worthy of holding themselves to a higher standard I don't see why a trans woman shouldn't.
Not if the entire relationship is based on that, no.
Cope I
Yes you should, seethe too.
<comment>
tfw my """"gf"""" isn't even a tranny just a normal sub dude
Man. I'm not even originally gay, just extremely starved of affection to the point I'd go for anything and had 0 options before. I like the guy but honestly I'd like something that's physically feminine too.
<comment>
worthy
shouldnt
exactly as those words imply: they cant and dont
<comment>
They do exist. What'd be even worse for you would be if she gains some self-esteem while you're dating her and she realizes she can do way better than you.
I'm a chaser, so yeah I know lol.
He can shave his face/body/cross dress or be an HRT femboy.
Except they easily can lol.
<comment>
Yeah but OP'S "girlfriend" is a tranny and thus bottom of the barrel to begin with. Beggars can't be choosers. Average tranny is equivalent to a 1/10 or maybe 2/10 real girl, if we're being generous.
<comment>
How is that even a response? If you both think you're settling for dogshit, then your relationship is dead in the water. That doesn't make it any better.
But even so, trans girls, especially if they pass like OP is implying, can definitely get normalfag bf's. They don't have to settle for incels or weird ugly neckbeards.
<comment>
He does shave but it's just not ideal. He's taller than me and I'm not dark triad enough to force him on HRT, don't even know if that would help any for a grown adult.
<comment>
Online relationships are not real and of you think otherwise it's pure copium
<comment>
Bullshit, they can become real relationships, it all depends on the willingness of the people involved, I met my boyfriend on this site and we started as a LDR, we now live together, don't pretend like those can't work just because of your skill issue lmao.
<comment>
What do you want out of him to be more feminine? Can you handle it?
Well obviously they become real at a certain point, at the latest when you move in together. If you meet up regular to fuck/cuddle and you love each other lots then idk how it's not really real. Not ideal, sure, but still real.
<comment>
How old is he exactly, I'd say if he is still in his early 30s there's some hope? And no you shouldn't force him into it.
<comment>
Try to get him on hrt, anon. Send him the diyhrt.cafe link or use it yourself to but his hormones, they're cheap. You can upgrade him to being a tranny gf.
Make sure he eats a caloric surplus too though or he probably won't get decent tits.
<comment>
they can become real
doesnt that mean he is correct?
<comment>
grown adult
Natalie Mars was 30 when she transitioned and is like the most successful tranny porn star of all time.
And it's not dark triad, you'll be improving his life. All gay bottoms want to be girls, some just don't realize it yet.
<comment>
He said "Online relationships are not real", there is no nuance at all in his message, it's all or nothing, so no factually he is wrong, because they have the potential to work.
<comment>
No. Some relationships are fake and some are real. The same is true of online relationships. If you have no plans to meetup then it's pretty much not real in most cases. If you meet up regularly I'd say it's real. Once you move in together basically anyone would say it's real and it didn't just become real when you moved in together.
<comment>
If we had met up, I wouldn't have said online relationship.
<comment>
Well do you plan to meet up? If so, then you're good. If not, then what's going on?
<comment>
Yeah, more feminine would be better. Dunno what you mean exactly by being able to handle it, please clarify.
20s. Yeah I'm not into mindgames so I definitely won't force him into anything.
Being able to touch booba would be nice. But I'm not even sure if I should bring this up to him. It's a minor concern compared to being alone honestly.
I'm not sure about that. That sounds like groomer language.
<comment>
being able to handle it
Like are you fine with him not being feminine forever?
<comment>
Dude 20s is literally perfect, most of us start at that age, if it's early 20s like 21 or 22 it's almost top tier, if you start before 25 you can even get some changes to your skeleton because the bone plates haven't stopped growing yet, if he's naturally feminine I'd mention it to him, just don't push him into it.
Hey about that, NTA but I thought I'd ask since you seem knowledgeable, I'm 5'2 and currently weight slightly short of 132 lbs, I put on weight on purpose cause I knew I needed it for fat redistribution, I started 2 months ago and I'm at tanner 2 so far, do you think I should put on more weight to accelerate breast growth? If so what should I be aiming for?
<comment>
Lmfao you faggot loser
Best post ITT

ONLINE RELATIONSHIP DONT COUNT BECAUSE THEY ARENT REAL
Think about it, if one of your friends said "I never see you with any girls, are you dating someone?"
Could you proudly say "I have an Internet relationship with someone I've never met" as if it's the same thing as them dating girls irl?
<comment>
Maybe if you asked kindly, Anon...
<comment>
Dunno. I have zero prior experience, everything is new to me, including my gripe here.
Hmm. I guess he does have a twink build already so he has a good basis? But the biggest problem is that he's almost 6 feet, and it doesn't help that I'm on the shorter side too. So maybe he's too tall for it.
<comment>
Hey anon. I would recommend as much weight gain as you can tolerate or are comfortable with. You could always diet / cut afterwards. Bodybuilders do the same thing with steroid cycles where they bulk and gain tons of weight and then cut so they shed the fat and keep the muscular gains.
Although honestly I think fat girls are cute anyway so the cutting part afterwards isn't even necessary.
Here's a pic from a large tits having trip who posted her approach.
<comment>
Well...Yeah, that is really tall, but there are tall women out there so I think as long as he'd want to do it, it wouldn't necessarily be a deal breaker, there's no such thing as perfection anyways, we all have some physical characteristics we wish we didn't have.
I did hear about progesterone, I'm definitely going to ask my endocrinologist to prescribe it to me the next time I speak with her, I had also heard about domperidone, but I am not sure how I could reasonably get my general practicioner to prescribe it to me, I can't tell them I want it for chest growth obviously.
And I don't mind being a lil chubby, it makes women look cuter anyways, I'll try to gain weight, thanks Anon!

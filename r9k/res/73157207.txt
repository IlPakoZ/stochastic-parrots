Join the millitary if your country isn't in an active conflict.
They are desperate for people and will take you in and train you as long as you arent literally disabled.
After that you should have easier time getting employed at any gov position including bureucratic bullshit or just staying in the millitary. Most people who enlist are actual mouth breathers so realistically you probably have a chance to get some minor command rank if you stick around.
have you got friends anon?
i dont want to hang around them im like the 5th wheel with nothing to contribute
I know they don't check medical records but does being in a psych ward for 3 days go on a criminal one? I was thinking about joining but I'd have to lie about all the mental shit up until this point.
No idea
Theyll probably have that written down somewhere but if you didn't literally try to kill yourself or someone else it should be fine
As i've said in the modern times no one wants to be a fucking soldier so the bar isn't at all high

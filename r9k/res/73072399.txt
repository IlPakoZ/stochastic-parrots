I feel the same way. 
I skipped an assignment and barely studied for an exam. I feel like shit too. But it's good to remind yourself - as long as you're alive and kicking, you can always do better next time! What are you studying? Anything I can do to make your night better?

why am i so incompetent
idk probably the same reason i am
me this weekend
kept pushing off work and now i don't have anything to show for tomorrow
<comment>
this mindset is terrible, because you've been doing the same everytime but you are not actively trying to fix the problem, so you remain the same everytime
it's good to be alive and kicking, but you gotta try to get out of the hole at some point
<comment>
Yeah, probably better to have a concrete plan about next steps. Still, it's good to remind myself it's not "over" just because I didn't do so well on something.
<comment>
anon if it makes you feel any better i've gotten fired from my jobs because i can't bring myself to show up
not even i don't want to. i tell myself i'm going to do something and then i don't do it

You're not incompetent, you just live in a society of fucking deranged retards. I pray God destroys it and kill us all out of mercy

I think some of us were just made this way. It's really a shame.

Because you've been biochemically sabotaged by everyone around you. You're full of toxins and you lack nutrients/microbes. The toxins kill you and your microbes while your body spends nutrients trying to neutralize the toxins. On top of being diseased and mentally ill, you are likely cognitively impaired as well because of this. You must reduce toxin exposure and increase nutrient intake. No more drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, medication, or goyslop. Eat animal products. Minimally processed, minimal additives, and from the healthiest animals possible. Even better if you eat it raw. Raw eggs are the best as they're the fastest and easiest to digest out of all food in the world, while at the same time giving you nearly every nutrient you need. Eat a lot of raw eggs, butter, and red meat. Fats and cholesterols make up your brain, nerves, myelin sheath, bile, sex hormones, the membranes of every cell in your body, and more. If you keep poisoning yourself, eating plants, and eating additive-laden highly processed trash, you will never get better

I used to be an incel. Every woman I talked to smelled the incel on me and instantly saw me as unattractive. They sensed that I viewed them as a means to get sex, and didn't like it. I now have a wife, and I'll tell you how you can accomplish it too.
1.) Set goals for yourself
- Get a house
- Have a happy wife
- Have a family
- Start a business
- Anything else pertaining to you, so long as it's long term
pick any of these, or all of these
2.) With every decision you make, lean on the side that pushes you towards your goal. That way, you are always on track
3.) Women are people, not objects. You may see them as inferior, and in certain aspects they are, but that does not change the fact that they have thoughts, emotions, motivations, histories, just like you. They laugh when things are funny, they cry when things are sad, and they want human connection, just like yourself.
4.) Be friendly with people. Imagine you are working at McDicks. If you are working towards having a connection with a woman (one of your goals), then be kind with them. Have confidence in the words you say. Be genuine with them. "Hey I'm done with my obligations today, and noticed you are a bit behind, would you like some assistance?" Work hard, be kind, and people will find being around you to be pleasant. Hell, just give someone a high five when they are working hard goes a long way to making friends.

5.) Now you have a small social circle of men and women, getting a girlfriend is considerably easier. Learn about them, what their hobbies are, and have them explain it to you, offering your opinion on different things they bring up.
6.) I know there is this myth that women are hard to read, but trust me, they are not. If she always gives you eye contact, if she touches you (like a pat on the shoulder), if her eyes are always dilated (NOT FROM DRUGS) when she is looking at you, if she puts her arms behind her back and sways a bit, if she plays with her hair, she is probably in to you.
7.) When you find a woman who is in to you, as long as she seems like a person you can hang out with, ask her out and pull the trigger. Have some balls. She is a friend, friends are fun to hang out with, then ask her to hang out. NOT A DATE. "You are such a good friend to me, would you like to go to the movies and see the latest flick?" PS, if you offer to do something that she likes, she is much more likely to say yes. Bring up topics and gauge her reaction and figure out what makes her tick.
8.) Keep you chin up. This is the most important instruction. If it doesn't work out, don't worry! Just keep following these steps and happiness will come. It's a catch 22, if you are sad and mad and depressed, you will attract those who seek to keep you down. If you are happy and friendly, people will try to get happy being around you. To be happy, you have to be kind with others, and eventually, true happiness will befall you.
If you follow these directions, I assure you, you will be successful and will be much happier than you are currently.

Why do they always have to be so condescending?

Will not work if you are genetically undesirable and under 6 ft

I'm going to assume you mean women. I need as much context as you can give me.
Perhaps she is going through a rough time in her life.
Perhaps she has a dark history.
Perhaps she is just a bitch.
Don't just take their shit if they are being a bitch to you. Everyone acts in their own self interests, and perhaps she sees you as less than a man.
Utterly untrue. I am 5 foot 8. I am half Italian and half German. I have an extreme widows peak that borders on balding. I'm not in great shape, weighing 200 lbs. I've see fat lards with models. It really is about personality, not about your body. If your goal is to get in shape, it can help, but is not 100% necessary.

Being arrogant seems to correlate with success.

Be friendly with people and instantly have a social circle
You don't know this, but that was luck. Luck that you happened to be around the right people. No amount of work was involved in those people being in a position to socialize with you. 
Also that they accepted your socializing and that you could build off of that. This is also luck. Its work but plenty of things that you can work towards are luck based. You had to work to be likeable but no amount of work would have made them accept you or made them available. 
Incels are incels because work can't change their situation.

If that's your goal. Set yourself on the track to getting one. Get a stable job. Work hard. Take as much overtime as possible. Save money. With every decision you make, make it to serve your goal of a house, and one day you will accomplish it.
<comment>
You are correct. There was certainly luck involved.
Let's go through 2 scenarios
1.) I am rude. I don't try. Every day is just another day. I have no goals or aspirations. The chance you find a good group of people is minor.
2.) I am nice. I am friendly. My goals are set, and I wake up each day knowing I'm getting closer to them. People see me as a sign of hope and ambition. The chance you find a good group of people is much higher.
Don't be afraid to move out of a shitty situation, that almost always furthers your goals. I disagree that there is no hope for some people. Rapists get pussy. Downies get pussy. Burn victims. Acid victims. Retarded people. They all can get it if in they are human, and keep looking for a brighter tomorrow.

You're assuming you're around people. 
Outside of work there aren't any situations where you can socialize with others in real life that you weren't already invited to. 
Even in your example you used work. You can be extremely outgoing and friendly and that wont make a difference if the people there have decided on not being friends for other reasons. Do you really suggest changing jobs till you find a group that works?

Women are people, not objects. You may see them as inferior, and in certain aspects they are, but that does not change the fact that they have thoughts, emotions, motivations, histories, just like you. They laugh when things are funny, they cry when things are sad, and they want human connection, just like yourself.
It actively pisses me off, and makes me fucking hate you and want to shit on your little deradicalization exercise, when you say things like this.
HOW FUCKING DARE you accuse me of viewing women as nothing but a "means to get sex"? How fucking DARE you, you piece of shit?
I've had girls tell me to my face that they have an incredible "connection" with me, right before they laugh at the suggestion that we could ever possibly date. You know the comedy clip where it's a conversation between a girl and her beta friend, and the girl says, "Why can't I meet a guy like you? NOT YOU, obviously!" I have had that happen in real life. That's a fucking DOCUMENTARY for me.
Why do they always have to be so condescending?
I'm going to assume you mean women.
No. It's you. YOU are the one being condescending. This entire thread is one gigantic exercise in condescension.
<comment>
I get it. Women can be cruel, but are men not cruel as well? Humanity expresses all levels of sainthood and villainy. The worst acts in the world were caused by people. The best acts as well. I don't didn't and will not condescend to you. I do not believe that I am better than you, but rather, I used to be you. If it was 2014, I'd be typing the same things you do. I wish for all to live the best lives they can. If you think that you are living a full and fulfilling life, than continue doing your own thing. I'm just suggesting different things that worked for me. I hope you can be happy, just like everyone I meet.

I think the deradicalizers are just that stupid.
They have some "social scientist" somewhere, who is really just a propagandist, telling them that "incels view women as objects that men should be able to freely use for sex" and other similar garbage, and so they write their scripts to address the picture that they've been given.
For them, it is ideologically necessary that it be true that all male social isolation be a result of male pathology.
I get it. Women can be cruel
That actually wasn't my point at all. I don't think those women were cruel; they just didn't find me sexually attractive, and therefore our "connection" didn't matter. My point wasn't "women are cruel" it was "OP is a dumbass."
Your post made me angry because it assumed that I never had "human connection" with women, when I had, and further assumed that if I managed to create "human connections" with women, it would get me into a romantic relationships, when it didn't.
I told the story of those women not to accuse them of being cruel, but to accuse you of not knowing what the hell you are talking about.
<comment>
Wow, you seem pretty mad. Everything ok at home?
<comment>
The deradicalizer shills on this board make me very angry. Whenever I read one of their posts, it's as if I am reading every last example of such posts, all over again. So I'm not giving OP just the anger arising from his own post; I am giving him the accumulated anger from the entire class of such posts.

This was a good. Esp the part about asking to hang out rather than asking for a date. Ill keep that in mind. Thx for the read OP
<comment>
you found a wife who took a gamble on you when you were 21 and spent her youth with you before you were guaranteed to be anything? This is how women show genuine romantic love.
Or are you saying to do all this to basically have a prostitute (woman who latches onto you for non-physical attraction reasons after 25)?
Why would anyone want a prostitutive (over 25) relationship? Women are bubbly lively and show love by choosing men in their youth.

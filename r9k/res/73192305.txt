are online gaming friends real friends? do they actually like spending time with me or do they just like playing the game and I happen to be there while they play?

dude if theyre spending time playing games with you they must enjoy your company. im not going to spend time around people i dislike no matter how much theyre good at the game. stop being insecure dweeb and realize people like you

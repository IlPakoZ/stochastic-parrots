I KNOW IT'S ORIGINALLY OVER AND IT NEVER REALLY BEGAN BUT IN MY HEART IT WAS SOOOOO REAL
10-4, good original buddy
i wish fresh flowers would bloom from these ruins but i've tried to sow seeds and it just doesn't happen
just gotta keep turning the soil
from death comes life
this place is a desert where no life can grow
i thought i'd finally found a daylily but i was just mistaken

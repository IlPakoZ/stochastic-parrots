you wouldn't date a fat woman
you have less than 10 total rejections
you wouldn't date a nonvirgin
you wouldn't consider an LDR
any girl has ever been into you
<comment>
But I think more men having standards is a good thing though I know that will never happen in the post social media world. It will give real incels a shot in the dating market
<comment>
But if your standards prevent you from having sex then you're a volcel.
<comment>
Any femanon who wants to try and talk to me hit me with a (You).
i have no qualms with pinkpillers

34 year old virgin here. 
you wouldn't date a fat woman
Depends on her overall size and appearance. It's disingenuous and stupid to enter a romantic relationship with someone you have no sexual attraction to
you have less than 10 total rejections
I've never actually asked any girls out. 
you wouldn't date a nonvirgin
I would. That doesn't really bother me. 
you wouldn't consider an LDR
I would, but I would like to meet eventually. 
any girl has ever been into you
A few have, but I failed to do anything with those situations.
I'm tired of late-teens early 20's guys acting like they know what complete sexual failure. My dick also doesn't really work right. I'm the most stereotypical fucking virgin loser weeaboo on this board, and yet I see you zoom-zoomies, daily, acting like you get to decide who gets into the pure loser club.
<comment>
So everyone is a volcel because they can have sex with hookers now?
<comment>
I'd love to fuck a hooker, but I'm more worried about getting pinched in a sting by normie-assed cops that never prosecute hookers but ruin the lives of lonely men seeking their services. 
America is a bullshit country is so many ways. This place is truly and completely insane at a fundamental level. At this point, I really do think I've just developed within the cultural womb of Babylon/BABALON. America is undoubtedly current incarnation of the great mother harlot.
<comment>
Having standards is fine, but if you are supposedly a lonely incel, you have no right to have almost any standards, and I don't think rape/prostitutes count towards solving inceldom, nor would dating an abusive cheater or someone who just wants to exploit you for money.
That's not good enough. The women here have ungodly standards.
never tried with girls and some have liked him
Loneliest """incel""" in 2023, everyone.
<comment>
you wouldn't date a fat woman
Yucky
you have less than 10 total rejections
I have 0
you wouldn't date a nonvirgin
Well duh. They aren't wife material 
you wouldn't consider an LDR
I do consider it daily actually 
any girl has ever been into you
Plenty
I guess I am 1/5th incel
<comment>
having a penpal is Africa means you're not an incel, you incel
Fuck off jewmoid.
<comment>
I never said "Incel"; /r9k/ wasn't for "incels" until relatively recently. It's for male virgins. 
Incel in popular nomenclature just means "loser guy I don't like" anyway; stop using such shitty terminology. Entering into a relationship for a relationship's sake is meaningless and kind of disgusting. 
I guarantee you have standards; don't sit there and fucking tell me you'd sand the callouses off of a fungal-infected, 800 lb 70 year old because she offered to be your girlfriend. You're an inauthentic cunt.
<comment>
No you're 0% incel, just a plain normalfag.
Lol what? Are you unable to fly to a girl you love?
admittedly not an incel
Got it, then I'm correct. Also you're equating not dating a fat woman to not dating one of the most disgusting women on earth. You can have some standards, but they have to be extremely low, otherwise your """loneliness""" is a total meme lol.
<comment>
I'm a volcel though. If I can't have a virgin wife then I would rathet not deal with dating at all because the idea of dating a non-virgin is repulsive. All ths women interested in me in real life have been very promiscuous so far so I have no choice but to continue my search online.
<comment>
Back to your oven, hebroid.
<comment>
So you're just agreeing with me completely, normalfag.
Smartest /pol/tard.
<comment>
I live in a country where prostitution is legal so of course I can't be an incel. Still, I want to find a suitable partner but I can't. Also it's not like I can control what I'm attracted to any more then a fag can. It's virgin or nothing for me.
<comment>
not dating one of the most disgusting women on earth. You can have some standards, but they have to be extremely low
Sorry faggot, you're just a low-tier volcel. You can't move the goalposts if you want to have an argument.
<comment>
I never moved any goalposts lol. Why do you want to pretend that you're not a normalfag so badly?
Inceldom precludes rape/prostitutes/gay sex, obviously, but yeah you can obviously be attracted to nonvirgins.
<comment>
Reminder you can't be a femcel if
you wouldn't date a fat man
you have less than 10 total rejections
you wouldn't date a virgin
you wouldn't consider an LDR
any boy has ever been into you
<comment>
I mean, yeah, obviously. """Femcels""" don't even try to get a bf almost 100% of the time. But nobody calls out fakecels normalfag guys.
<comment>
i dont care im not into you, dont talk to me woman
<comment>
see>>73078564
Oh, let me guess, that totally wasn't you? Do you even know what the term "Goalpost moving" is? If you're not willing to bang an AIDS-infested blimp, you're just a volcel, anon.
<comment>
Reminder you can't be a femcel if
female
No need to continue.
<comment>
I'm a man.
I didn't post that actually lol. I do think you can have very bare minimum standards.
<comment>
Call me a volcel all you want, but my standards are that a woman both wants to be a mother and would make a good mother. Maybe I could fuck a random slut if I tried, but I don't want that.
<comment>
Oh yeah? Strictly define them, then, "incel".
I've noticed you still won't post your age, because it's pretty obvious that you're just some bored normie teenager that Stacy unfriended on Facebook or some shit. Did you used to laugh at frog memes with her in middle school, babbu?
<comment>
you are a man using little girls as avatars? what a fucking faggot you are
<comment>
Being able to have a gf but not having a children would be bliss to any incel.
I can't strictly define them. There are nearly infinite caveats, and it's a fuzzy line but most """incels""" are way over it lol. Also you're posting pics I've used before so you should know me.
<comment>
incels are the least of your concerns you go around and act like a little princess on the internet, i think you need to be slapped by a father figure.
<comment>
Wtf are you talking about? Lol. I'm just posting cute anine girls.
<comment>
if i had a son who liked cute frilly little cartoon girls i would kick him out.
<comment>
Okay, so, you can't define anything that your argument rests on claiming as such, and won't fuck the hambeast next door. Got it, volcel. Maybe if you didn't have such high standards you'd get laid instead of making threads here.
<comment>
her argument is basically 
"If you are starving and dont eat the pile of shit you are just fasting!"
<comment>
Continuum fallacy.
I just said you could have bare minimum standards lmao.
<comment>
your level of bare minimum is 
oh you want to have sex why dont you just get a fat boomer on grindr to ram your asshole
<comment>
you wouldn't date a fat woman
would
you have less than 10 total rejections
1/10 (Social retard so its hard for me to even try)
you wouldn't date a nonvirgin
would
you wouldn't consider an LDR
would
any girl has ever been into you
never ever
i have everything excluding the 10 rejections do i still qualify as a Incel in your view?
<comment>
can't be an incel if you want children
You are honestly the biggest fucking mongoloid on this entire board, and that's saying a lot.
<comment>
Can you find where I said that?
If you're not trying you're not an incel. 10 rejections is barely trying at all but almost all "incels" can't even do that much.
Never said that. I'm saying if you can get a gf who doesn't want children, you're not an incel.
<comment>
you implied it, read between the lines dumb fuck
<comment>
i am trying its just hard
yes dady putin
<comment>
no true scotsman fallacy thread
Unsurprisingly, you don't understand the words or terms you're using. 
Try harder in the future, moron.
<comment>
No I didn't. I've said the opposite.
no true scotsman fallacy
Gatekeeping what counts as an incel isn't what that means lol. You're so desperate and it's pathetic.
<comment>
you wouldn't date a nonvirgin
Is this the actual reason you made this thread OP anon?
<comment>
LDR
It doesn't work and she is fucking someone behind your back.
<comment>
No, I am a virgin man lol.
Plenty of LDRs work out, and if you have a girl you can fly to and fuck and cuddle when you're there, you're still not quite an incel lol.
<comment>
Gatekeeping what counts as an incel isn't what that means lol. You're so desperate and it's pathetic.
You're actually a fucking moron. You've barely digested anything I've said to you, and genuinely have no understanding of the terms or words you're using. Go look up the things you don't understand in my post, and then fuck off. I hate zoomers even more than women, honestly.
<comment>
You're not making any real points lol. You just admitted you're a normalfag right off the bat then you're trying to say that since I can't give you an exhaustive list of all acceptable standards that holding any at all makes someone a volcel.
<comment>
you can obviously be attracted to nonvirgins.
Sexually attracted sure, but actual romantic attraction? No way. The gross feeling I get about being intimate with a non-virgin is enough to put me off them completely.
<comment>
Totally agree.
Just fuck a roadkill, BOOM, no more virginity.
If you don't do that, you're a volcel, lol
<comment>
Any incel would just learn to cope with that.
having a fat gf is on par with having sex with a dead animal
Ungodly superficial lmao.
<comment>
Being intimate with something disgusting is on par with being intimate with something disgusting
Glad we understand each other.
<comment>
I don't get the attachment to the incel label. You can label me as volcel and it doesn't change the fact that women have unrealistic standards that create in/volcels.
<comment>
Yes and short men are also disgusting to true femcels. You can't ask them to consider something so vile?
The point is, overall, that most """in"""cels here are total normalfags. Even on /r9k/, incels are hard to come by.
<comment>
Having standards doesn't make you not an incel.
If no women are interested in you in the first place you can have the strictest standards and still be an incel. It doesn't make any difference since you are an incel
<comment>
That's an attempt to shift blame for current state of incels
AKSHUALLY it's not women who don't want to be with you, it's YOU being overly selective for not forcing yourself into relationship with someone you don't want.
Not sure why these faggots do this, but they nonetheless do it.
<comment>
If somehow they knew they'd be incels for life no matter what they did, that could be the case, but if you discount all non-stacys or do what a lot of incels ITT are doing, they're discounting fine women who might consider dating them.
shift blame
Most women are pieces of trash and have unrealistic expectations, obviously. You can't do much about it, so you have to be adjust your expectations for what you want out of a gf.
<comment>
short men are also disgusting to true femcels
We already been over this countless times on this board.
In the world with most men being 5'5", women would get wet at the sight of 5'10" man.
Problem is that female standards are constantly shifting to more and more and more and more right into an unsustainable state.
Unlike men whose standards and desires haven't changed much for the last couple centuries.
THAT'S the problem.
<comment>
You don't even have to know you are incel. As long as women just don't find you attractive you could still say that you wouldn't date someone obese.
<comment>
The average man is 5'9 globally, so can true femcels reject loads of guys who are like 5'2?
As long as women just don't find you attractive
That's literally every man in the world lol. What are you talking about?
<comment>
Oh no, I can't attach a label to my person because a random trannyfucker associates arbitrary points with what is, frankly, quite a clear cut and easily understandable term. Whatever will I do?
<comment>
most """in"""cels here are total normalfags
You are utterly wrong. Total normalfags by definition (which is funny cause you are being a definition autist with this thread) just have a girlfriend and they never consider either label. Total normalfags also laugh at incels and would never want to be labeled one cause they are losers who can't get laid.
<comment>
That's literally every man in the world lol
So you think no women ever find men attractive? They just randomly choose someone to be their bf or husband at a coin toss? There are no factors like face or height or anything like that that makes women like you?
What are you talking about?
What do you think an incel is?
<comment>
you have to be adjust your expectations for what you want out of a gf
Or you can be a **lcel and realize that fucking a roadkill or "earning" a modern woman who would be receptive isn't a realistic option.
<comment>
Any incel would just learn to cope with that
Any incel could also psyop themselves into being gay. Or just take hormone altering drugs to turn gay. Voila incel no more.
<comment>
Still LARP like you're a victim and seethe about it ITT, I guess.
I'm saying they're mostly normalfags and not at all like incels, not that they're high-tier normalfags who just use social media and club all day while thinking 4chan is for haxors.
So you think no women ever find men attractive?
I misread what you wrote. How would you know no women find you attractive?
What do you think an incel is?
They can't get a woman to have consensual unpaid sex with them while fitting some extremely low standards (e.g. can't be abusive/cheaters/trying to exploit you).
Sure, be a volcel. That's fine and goes along with my thread lol.
Any incel could also psyop themselves into being gay
How? Lol.
hormone altering drugs to turn gay
Wtf are you talking about?
<comment>
How would you know no women find you attractive?
I guess getting rejected by those you thought were attracted to you or just never having girls show any interest in you.
They can't get a woman to have consensual unpaid sex with them while fitting some extremely low standards (e.g. can't be abusive/cheaters/trying to exploit you).
I agree.
A person who is an incel can have standards like he wouldn't date an obese non-virgin if he somehow was able to attract such a woman. Sure, if he had the chance to he would not be an incel but he can still have the standard.
<comment>
just never having girls show any interest in you
Meaning what? Like most guys will never have a single girl approach them. And if you've only had a handful of rejections, that hardly means no girl could ever been into you.
if he had the chance to he would not be an incel but he can still have the standard
Sure.
<comment>
How? Lol.
The same way I could ignore the disgust I feel for non-virgin women? You can become delusional if you try hard enough. Plus hormones affect what you are attracted to. A lot of trannies turn gay from estrogen. Incels could just hop on estrogen and become flaming fags and after that having a 1000+ bodycount is stupidly easy.
<comment>
you wouldn't date a fat woman
I love chubby women
you have less than 10 total rejections
If being ghosted counts, yes
you wouldn't date a nonvirgin
Don't care about virginity or body count
you wouldn't consider an LDR
Tried it, didn't like the feeling
any girl has ever been into you
How would i know, probably not though
<comment>
Can femcels?
Listen anyone can reject anyone for whatever reason, but women reject men for outright absurd reasons.
Today while sitting on a toilet I realized that I spent same amount of money for slightly bigger tp rolls with thinner inner cardboard tubes, meaning that I got a nice deal with ~25% more tp for the same price.
Now riddle me this- how many women would feel an ick if they found that I'm considering this? Because I can bet most women see man being considerate with his money a red flag.
Ffs some foids think having android instead iphone is a fucking red flag.
That's the problem with modern dating.
Female standards are batshit crazy.
<comment>
Meaning what? Like most guys will never have a single girl approach them. And if you've only had a handful of rejections, that hardly means no girl could ever been into you.
No like interacting with women and you know she doesn't like you.
<comment>
When's OP gonna start bragging about his imaginary tranny GF again?
<comment>
Listen chudcel, until ALL women reject you, you can't call yourself an incel.
10 women rejected you?
Well you haven't asked the rest of 4B of women.
Untill you managed to get rejected by EVERY SINGLE WOMAN ALIVE you're just a volcel
t.OP(allegedly)
<comment>
and not at all like incels
Yes most people aren't incels by autistic literal definition of the word. That isn't anything new. And if everyone agrees with you nothing changes and women still have unrealistic standards + "incels" aren't normies. But you are just larping so yeah.
<comment>
you wouldn't date a nonvirgin
what if i would have done in the past but wouldn't anymore? it's not like any nonvirgin wants to date me nowadays, but i'd rather just stay single at that point anyway. this ascend me from truecel status to volcel? have i not been sent my own way?
<comment>
You said you can be sexually into them. Are you retarded?
If being ghosted counts
When asking them out and then they ghost you? Yeah.
Tried it
Not even close to an incel, also it means a girl has been into you.
You genuinely seem like 80 IQ lol. I'm asking can a girl reject very short guys and still be a true femcel?
Many guys have to try with many different woman. They're still normalfags but they don't give up instantly.
most people aren't incels
Most people on /r9k/ who call themselves incels aren't actual incels - is what I'm saying.
What am I LARPing as? Lol. I'm just a guy.
The implication is normally that some might consider dating you but you wouldn't. If none of them would consider dating you, then you could still be an incel while holding that standard, but you still should be regularly asking them out.
<comment>
you wouldn't date a fat woman
This is horrible advice tho, it fuether leads to sexual market inflation and enables w*men to be fat because it shows them that there will always be someone who's desperate enough. 
you have less than 10 total rejections
More than I can count so I'm good here
you wouldn't date a nonvirgin
I'm degeneracymaxxed so good here too 
you wouldn't consider an LDR
Anything's fine
any girl has ever been into you
does ons count? No toilet wants a relationship with me tho so that's why I'm here
<comment>
then you could still be an incel while holding that standard
i know.
but you still should be regularly asking them out.
i've literally never met a feller that asked a girl out that has a gf. the girl ALWAYS asks the guy out. forgive me for not caring to inflate these whores' egos during this grave apostasy where said whores only give their rotten pussies away to the top 20% of men, niggers, and dogs. i've been rejected enough. not doing it anymore.
<comment>
Don't you have an egirl you could date?
<comment>
I bet this is totally, really, actually a girl, you fucking MBposting turdgulper.
<comment>
there will always be someone who's desperate enough
There will, though. Even if all incels stop asking them out, there'll still be normalfag guys who'll date/fuck them. You're not going to boycott women out of dating them to make them self-improve.
does ons count
Of course? Lmao
the girl ALWAYS asks the guy out
That only happens when the guy is considerably attractive.
<comment>
no, they have like 500+ dudes on discord, 15 dudes in real life, 1000+ dudes on tinder, 100 dudes on instagram, and then some on other platforms. what do you think the odds of me being the most attractive are? i'll tell you, there's a ZERO percent chance. 
inb4 women only care about how nice you are
there are 6'8 guys that are nice. most men are nice. 
how about i kill you, retard?
That only happens when the guy is considerably attractive.
and that's why you only see relationships where the guy is considerably attractive
<comment>
Hmm then explain why the 2 matches I got on bumble have not sent me shit
<comment>
I'm asking can a girl reject very short guys and still be a true femcel
I already responded to that particular question.
Rich for you to accuse me of low IQ
<comment>
You said you can be sexually into them.
I can feel an initial sexual attraction but if I actually try to go through having sex with them it makes me feel sick.
<comment>
Bullshit. No one gets to dictate to anyone else who they are and aren't attracted to. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
<comment>
how about i kill you, retard?
Careful, champ; if you get thrown in prison, when will you ever have time to actually read good manga instead of trash?
<comment>
Not even close to an incel
Yeah your kinda right, especially considering why it ended kinda makes me a vocel
also it means a girl has been into you
Huh, never thought of it that way, i was only thinking about in person and not online(although if i do consider online there have been multiple women into me)
<comment>
you only see relationships where the guy is considerably attractive
Not really, lol.
They're bots/accidentally matched you.
No you didn't.
Most virginal """incel""", everyone. Maybe stop reading propaganda here and you'll realize dating a nonvirgin is okay.
If you think you're not attracted to any fat women then do nofap for at least a week and watch BBW porn.
<comment>
i guarantee you that i've read more manga than you.
Not really, lol.
yes really, hahahahahahaha. at least amongst gen z. i'm 6'1 and i hardly ever see anyone shorter than me in a relationship. if i do, they mog the average dude into a 3rd realm
<comment>
The only matches I got were accidents/bots
It's really fucking over innit
<comment>
You literally have an egirls who left the board just so she could talk to you lol.
<comment>
LDR
Nonsensical. The point of being an incel is that you can't have sex. How are you gonna get sex when you're in a pretend relationship with a girl who doesn't even have you near them
<comment>
Nu-hu
Ya-ha
Let me refresh your memory.
Listen anyone can reject anyone for whatever reason
Just because you have comprehension issues doesn't mean you can talk shit to others.
<comment>
You aren't fucking me, I don't give a fuck about your opinions. Blackpill and inceldom isn't a debate.
<comment>
there have been multiple women into me
Loneliest """in"""cel in the world.
Well most young guys are still having sex just fine. I doubt they're all le incels now.
Dating apps are 95% looks. Most guys won't get a gf off dating apps. Your pics, like most guys' pics, are probably dogshit as well.
You fly to her and fuck her lol.
So true femcels can have high standards, got it. I guess we disagree on the definition of incel.
inceldom isn't a debate.
Yes it is.
<comment>
Okay. Let me know when you have a wife for me. Don't give a fuck about your bullshit spin.
<comment>
Oh, I assumed the long distance part would be perpetual. Still a very easy way to get catfished
<comment>
almost as if they have 1,000s of guys that they talk to. sent me literally one message.
Well most young guys are still having sex just fine.
they're literally not. my one friend asked out a girl 2 weeks ago, the girl quit her job because it was such a weird, scary experience, dude's 5'8 but fairly goodlooking. another, 6'5, khhv. i only have 2 friend that have had gfs and they're both insanely goodlooking and were both asked out by their gfs. it's terrible out there
<comment>
You have to actually try yourself.
the long distance part would be perpetual
That's not how any LDR works. Also you can both show yourself with timestamped pics, voice chat, etc.
Well all my friends are normalfags so maybe you're just in a bad crowd.
<comment>
maybe you're just in a bad crowd.
mine are also, it's just that the model tier ones get 5/10 girls, the rest (myself included of course) get nothing.
<comment>
Tranny-kun's posts at this point have reached a logical deadend that basically incels dont exist, thus the dichotomy of incel-normie(aside from not making sense to begin with) is redundant. This one part of this equation is just a real thing. 
In that case this whole thread is redundant as well.
I mean since technically anybody can get a ldr via larp.
<comment>
My pics showcase an ideal image. There's one of me outdoors (to show that I get out), one with my mates (to show that I have friends). 
They are also images that I look the best in. So if they don't work it's over
<comment>
Do you all fit the five bare minimum requirements in the OP? Your anecdotes don't really counter actual statistics, dough.
anybody can get a ldr via larp
Yeah that obviously wouldn't count as a real relationship lol. Plenty of incels do exist, just most /r9k/ '""in"""cels are LARPing normalfags.
Do you have women who can judge your pics? Just going by your own standards you could have a warped perception.
<comment>
normalfags
Err, how can you call them normalfags? Do they have between 3 and 5 close friends, and 22-26 acquaintances? Have they had a relationship last longer than 6 months and 13 days? Do they have a job that pays 80-120% of your country's average wage?
Because if they don't meet those requirements, they aren't normalfags and you shouldn't deign to use that word.
<comment>
Loneliest """in"""cel in the world
Still very lonely when it a few random women(assuming they're all women) from all over the world
The sea is very big, but i have no one in my pond who wants me, let alone one that is compatible long-term
<comment>
Use whichever label you want, they're not incels lol.
<comment>
Do you all fit the five bare minimum requirements in the OP?
honestly one or two haven't gotten the 10 rejections, just one or two, but other than that, yeah. 
Your anecdotes don't really counter actual statistics, dough.
the statistics are rubbish. what, you got 2000 people and asked them if they get laid? who cares about that. people will tell you constantly that if you go outside, you'll see nothing but 5'2 indians with gigastacies, when the absolute opposite is true in 99.99999999% of cases
<comment>
I will use whatever label I want, but don't you dare to call them normalfags. Normalfags have a very specific set of requirements and I will gatekeep them (despite not being one myself, at least by my definitions) to protect them from idiots like you.
<comment>
If I had female friends who could judge my pics I wouldn't be a gfless robot who has to scrounge around on tinder and bumble
<comment>
There is no real difference between ldr and a larp in all instances of it, because human behaviour changes significantly between text and inperson communication.
<comment>
Still very lonely when it a few random women(assuming they're all women) from all over the world
There's a missing word somewhere in there so Idk what you mean. Just find another gf, normalfag.
other than that, yeah
Do they still regularly try to talk to girls? Also aren't you like in high school?
you got 2000 people and asked them if they get laid?
They ask them more than that, and the point is they have an approximately random sample of the U.S. population, not the friends of an /r9k/ shitposter.
What do they need protection from?
You can post your pics online for people to judge them. You could get tips for better angles/lighting or styles for your clothes/hair/etc. But even so, online is mostly looks, so it could very well be not over even if you get 0 attention off apps.
human behaviour changes significantly between text and inperson communication
I mean you can talk over voice and stuff, but it does change. When you have an LDR and you meetup there's adjusting to the new situation but you can very well still love each other and enjoy each other's company even more.
<comment>
Protection from people like you who can't or won't properly identify them, obviously. Bigot.
<comment>
Do they still regularly try to talk to girls? Also aren't you like in high school?
we all talk to female coworkers. all are either taken, or as said before, the single ones quit after being asked out
<comment>
At least I have good reasons to gatekeep.
There are more girls than just ones at work to court.
<comment>
I cant believe you guys think this poster is me, embarassing. I've got way more charm than this rookie. Incredible, I take a small hiatus and i've already been replaced by a troglodyte who can barely form a coherent sentence
your posts are all embarassing, you're completely obsessed with women, you're a disgrace to kumagawa and everything he represents. You keep mentionning your height because it's the only thing you have. Never avatarfag as him you're not worthy of this title. You dont have his charm, you dont have his wit, you dont have his grit, you dont have his persistence nor do you have his resilience. Listen, I wouldnt mind having someone else take up the mantle and post as kumagawa while I leave is place forever, but if you do that you cant just complain about women all day, I cant have my legacy ruined by a poser like you. Try being half the poster I was and THEN start posting with kuma pics.
tldr; YWNBARL (you will never be a real loser)
<comment>
I would be thoroughly made fun of if I posted my pics online.
Thanks for trying to convince me it ain't over.
<comment>
So do I. I am the crusader on behalf of those who are ignored. I'm a hero, because even though they don't ask me to do what I do, and they all hate me because I'm a total fucking mongoloid, I know in my heart that it's not just about my ego. I'm making a difference.

you're a disgrace to kumagawa and everything he represents

what's the point
<comment>
Can you explain the meme about the e-girl thing then?
I think it could be worth a try in places that are meant for constructive criticism that would ban harassment.
Do you think I think I'm a hero?
You said you tried an LDR, which is what I mean, and you're a normalfag if you've ever dated (including LDR).
Those are just bare minimum standards to be considered an incel lol.
Because lots of normalfags clearly love wanting to pretend they're incels. Just look at the thread.
<comment>
kumagawa's an incel
if you did more than skim through the fucking manga you'd know he's not

not a good loser that's for sure

claiming victory before the battle's over, that's not very kumagawa-like
<comment>
Do you think I think I'm a hero?
We both are, anon. They'll never thank us, we're not doing anything useful, and we're wrong most of the time. But we. Are. Heroes!
<comment>
You said you tried an LDR
It was a domme/sub thing, not an actual relationship, although she wanted to make it one but i couldn't go along with a poly-relationship
<comment>
How am I wrong most of the time?
Same thing applies, then. Still a normalfag.
<comment>
Leftists have this weird thing where they think they can gaslight people into ignoring reality and they like "winning" arguments. A particular subset of shit posters have latched onto the incel thing.
They either can't comprehend that a leftist logic isn't going to matter or for their own purposes of satisfaction of their narcissism they feel compelled to come on here and make these arguments. 
Haha well you aren't a TRUE INCEL. HAHAHAHHA.
Meanwhile I could give a shit less. I want a nerdy girlfriend with huge breasts. I want to stop being so miserable.
OP feels like they "won" though. Even though it's not a battle and the label quite literally doesn't matter.
<comment>
Can you explain the meme about the e-girl thing then?
tldr there was an egirl who got was getting some traction and I cut her career short.

And here you are calling yourself a loser...

I remember that annoying faggot. DId you e-date or something?
<comment>
How am I wrong most of the time?
IN THE SAME POST:
having a single failed LDR makes you a normalfag
Duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<comment>
Never claimed to be one, quite the opposite, in fact. 
I am alone tho.
<comment>
Whatever counts in your book you can count, but i don't really count it(half count at most imo)
But your bar for being a normalfag is pretty low, but i guess in your eyes since i had one genuine connection with a woman online i definitely must fit in with the rest of society
<comment>
a loser with charm and a way with words
Ironic coming from you, pot calling the kettle black. Anyways no we're not e-dating, just a friend i've saved from the jaws of attentionwhoring. Cant we just pretend her existence was all fiction
<comment>
incel
Never received any attention of any kind from any person whatsoever, no exceptions.
normalfag
Has received at least 1 small crumb of attention from someone.
Chad
Has fucked 200+ women.
It's that simple, and when we put it like that, we can see just how useful these terms are! Yay!
<comment>
Dating people does make you a normalfag, yes, so does having girls or any girl like you.
You're probably a low-tier normalfag. You can use a different word if you want, but still you're nowhere near an incel which is all I really care about.
pot calling the kettle black
I am trying to be annoying. That doesn't mean I can't find others annoying too.
<comment>
Never received any attention of any kind from any person whatsoever, no exceptions.
Has received at least 1 small crumb of attention from someone
By those definitions there is no such thing as an actual incel, and 99.99999% men are normalfags
still you're nowhere near an incel which is all I really care about.
I'm assuming you go by an odd version of incel and not what it actually means
<comment>
not what it actually means
How so? Lol what? You've multiple girls online like you unless I'm mixing you up with someone else. Just find an LDR.
<comment>
thinks someone who has tried relationships but not managed to have sex isn't an incel
thinks that fucking a tranny isn't homosexual
Hoo boy
<comment>
How so?
Because it's short for involuntarily celibate, which literally means unable to get sex(and by extension a relationship)
You've multiple girls online
Most guys with average looks can attract multiple women online(not dating apps) as long as they are somewhat compatible/interesting and aren't complete ass holes
But there is a big difference between being able to attract women and landing one, especially online where most of the one you do attract aren't willing to have LDR themselves
Just find an LDR
No, like i said i don't like them
<comment>
I'm bisexual not gay, dough.
Most guys with average looks can attract multiple women online
Most guys are normalfags, yeah, including you. It being easy isn't a reason for why it doesn't count lmao.
No
You have options you don't want to take. You're still not an incel lol.
<comment>
dudes logic is just out the window
<comment>
any girl has ever been into you
Would this include when I was a child? One woman apparently kinda liked me as a kid, but no longer does.
<comment>
Good argument.
How old were you? An adult woman liked you when you were a minor?
<comment>
What do you get out of arguing who is or isn't incel all day every day? Serious question
<comment>
It's fun for me. Incels deserve a gatekeeper to fight against the normalfags LARPing as them who spit in their face, and since I'm not super emotionally-invested, I can do so with a pretty level head.
<comment>
I think pretty much anyone can get laid if they tried hard enough and aren't severely deformed or mentally ill. Incel is almost a useless term. You terminally online or what?
<comment>
you wouldn't date a fat woman
yeah because im actually fit and obesity is a indicator of poor self control in other areas of her life
you have less than 10 total rejections
i have 2
you wouldn't date a nonvirgin
dont really mind unless shes to the point you could summarise her life with the lyrics of "scott pilgrim vs. the world ruined a whole generation of women"
you wouldn't consider an LDR
no because im possessive and couldnt be assured shes actually exclusive
any girl has ever been into you
no they havent
1.5/5 incel :)
<comment>
I think you're a normalfag who can't understand what loneliness is, then.
Tripping any of those mines means you're not an incel.

still a cel just a volcel
<comment>
If you feel loneliness, it's optional and/or minuscule in comparison to the type of incels.
just a volcel
Exactly lol, like most ITT.
<comment>
Tripping any of those mines means you're not an incel.
true, im just a below average guy with bare minimum standards, most r9k users/volcels are
<comment>
Not talking about myself 
All loneliness is optional? You aren't really defining your terms much anime girl avatarfag. If you posted about it at a greather lenght you can link that or you can be more specific in what makes incels incels
<comment>
All loneliness is optional?
No? What are you talking about?
you can be more specific in what makes incels incels
They can't get a woman to have consensual unpaid sex with them while fitting some extremely low standards (e.g. can't be abusive/cheaters/trying to exploit you).
<comment>
They can't get a woman to have consensual unpaid sex with them while fitting some extremely low standards (e.g. can't be abusive/cheaters/trying to exploit you).
Nigga how are you able to know if someone is going to do all that to you? Sure, there are some red flags but you can miss them or you may be too stupid to notice. Or simply there weren't any tells until it's too late.
That is such a dumb "standard"
Now tell me how can someone fail at that while actually trying
<comment>
They try with lots of low-tier girls and persistently get rejected with no signs that a girl has ever liked them. They try and constantly fail, i.e. they can't do it, at least up to that point.
<comment>
Don't you think it matters a lot how they try? Show bob and vagene? No, i don't mean literally that but i do mean being awkward and bad at talking to others. Even if you have anxiety you can still take meds and work on this. There are always ways to improve and it's always harder for some people. Unless they tried literally everything they can think of then i wouldn't really call them an incel. Oh yeah and some people just stink of desperation lol
<comment>
Don't you think it matters a lot how they try?
Of course? Lol.
you can still take meds and work on this
Of course, but if you're an incel your problems don't go away like a flick of a switch or even after months of solid continuous effort. You could have to work on yourself for multiple years before a single girl agrees to go on a date with you and then flakes out before the date.
<comment>
So you're ucking people you don't want to fuck just to avoid being an incel is what we should be doing? That's literally you advocating incels set themselves up to get raped
<comment>
Given that attraction is an involuntary reaction, you can't voluntarily avoid sex with fat girls you aren't attracted to. Choosing to have sex with them or not is not a voluntary action, so avoiding sex with them doesn't make you a volcel instead of an incel.
<comment>
you're not an incel if you haven't done this or you're not that
also all non-chad men are incels
this is your mindset.
<comment>
How is that rape? Lol. I'm not saying they have to do it, just that they're volcels if they have the option/they don't pursue it.
If you think you aren't attracted to a single fat woman then do nofap for a week and watch BBW porn. If you don't get turned on then I think you might be homosexual.
Almost all men aren't incels. You're combining two opposite worldviews.
<comment>
but if you're an incel your problems don't go away like a flick of a switch
Never said it. Simply said that there is always something you can do. Didn't even say results would be quick or that it wouldn't be something you have to deal with on the daily still.
We live in a most "sexually liberated" time and you are telling me there are guys who can't get a SINGLE girl to even go on a date with them? I don't even know where to start. 
Ps. Bringing up fat women is like saying " just go fuck a guy, what are you a volcel?" Lol
<comment>
We live in a most "sexually liberated" time and you are telling me there are guys who can't get a SINGLE girl to even go on a date with them?
Yes? Lol. Is this your first day on the internet? You're like the guy saying "seriously dude how tf did you get through college and you didn't fuck at least 1 chick bro???"
Also most men are attracted to fat women. It's not at all comparable to being attracted to men lol. Fat women still incredibly easily find normalfag bf's for a reason.
<comment>
any girl has ever been into you
Bitch was crazy and literally stabbed her last 3 boyfriends.
Not to mention was just a manipulative bitch looking for someone to control.
Just because I rather not get stabbed or physically mentally and emotionally abused just for the sake of maybe getting laid doesn't mean my standards are too high.
Sex isn't worth losing my life over.
Also
you wouldn't consider an LDR
How do you have sex long distance anon?
Why would you even bring up ldr when they aren't relevant to the subject of sex?
Hate to burst your bubble but cybering isn't actually sex.
It isn't even a standards thing. LDR isn't a real sexual relationship.
<comment>
Attraction and being horny are two different things. One can happen without the other and visa versa.
<comment>
Sex isn't worth losing my life over.
Of course, but the fact that a girl has liked you means most likely you're decently attractive and can find another girl to date with relative ease.
LDR isn't a real sexual relationship
You can meetup, anon.
Elaborate. Are you turned on by seeing naked fat women but not into them somehow?
<comment>
They are interconnected and related though.
<comment>
You're like the guy saying "seriously dude how tf did you get through college and you didn't fuck at least 1 chick bro???"
No. There could be many reasons for it. It boild down to not caring enough to try over and over just to get some low tier pussy. It can be religious reasons, not being comfortable with hook up culture/strangers you just met and bad at social interactions so you don't get close to anyone, avoid social gatherings, etc.
Also most men are attracted to fat women
Most men are also not "incels". I was being hyperbolic on purpose. You are a porn addicted bifag so i'm amazed you were able to tell the difference. Thing is that there are *some* man who simply aren't. This is a fact
Good comparison would be race, certaintly better than sex. For example if certain skin color looking ugly to you or racist beliefs. Would you call a kkk neo nazi volcel because he wouldn't have sex with 300lbs black girl? Lol
<comment>
the fact that a girl has liked 
You don't understand dude.
She didn't like me because she found me attractive.
She liked me because she thought I could become another victim for her.
She wasn't looking for a relationship, she just wanted someone she could control.
Because I was not neurotypical and because I don't have actual normal dating options, she figured my social isolation would make me perfect for manipulation.
However I have intact self preservation instincts and heard the full details of her patterns of behavior and could see her manipulating tactics as well as consistent attempts to isolate me more.
It be like saying someone should be able to become rich if they were wealthy looking enough to be robbed.
<comment>
LDR
You can meetup, anon
Not everyone has or can hold a job, retarded normalfag
<comment>
Most men are also not "incels"
Not relevant. Your hyperbole makes no sense when no straight men are attracted to men and most men are attracted to fat women.
Thing is that there are *some* man who simply aren't
Maybe like .1% of men but I think most of these guys are just deluded because they hate fat women.
She didn't like me because she found me attractive.
How do you know?
If you can't hold a job then get NEETbuxx. But if you can't then that could make an LDR unworkable.
<comment>
She was the same age as me.
<comment>
you wouldn't date a fat woman
if she has a cute face hell yeah
you have less than 10 total rejections
never asked a girl out before

I would date a literal prostitute
you wouldn't consider an LDR
I would be down to marry
any girl has ever been into you
this has happened at least once before
<comment>
Funny how incels have a normie mentality when it comes to sex. "Just fuck anything, bro, sex isn't anything more than meat being shoved around!" You fucking incels have that insufferable dudebro mentality and you don't even realize it. You devalue women the same way normie men do it but you don't have the looks or personality to back it up and that truly is entitlement.
<comment>
I think sex is more than just meat being shoved around
I've never had sex with a non prostitute, but I like gfe type deals, the more lovey dovey it is the better
<comment>
As a kid you were as old as a woman? How old were you then, still? If you were like 14 that's quite a bit different from if you were 4.
Nowhere close to an incel.
I literally said date and never mentioned sex.
<comment>
I literally said date and never mentioned sex.
You did when you said incel, you retard.
<comment>
I don't think anyone should have sex with anything, but if you have the ability to have sex with a girl, then you can probably also date her. I idolize losing your virginity to a girl you love, not just fucking random girls and being a manwhore when you supposedly don't like slutty girls.
<comment>
How do you know?
Because she said as much when I started distancing from her and she went mask off.
Though I nipped that little tirade in the bud by standing up for myself.
After telling her that I refuse to interact with anyone who treats me poorly and stepping away (while not turning my back) she literally just shrugged, went mask on again, and said she read me wrong and left me alone.
Though I heard the next guy she got involved with actually had downs syndrome and she was stealing his ssi checks and fucked her drug dealers on the side, while of course beating the shit out of him.
My cousin says the cops were involved at one point but idk.
But hey, he got laid right. That's the only thing that's important.
<comment>
you supposedly don't like slutty girls
I like whoever will let me have sex, in my case that would be prostitutes only
<comment>
Yeah and that would make you a volcel, not an incel. The whole OP post was a rant on volcels though so what even is the argument at this point???
<comment>
Okay then I don't think that counts.
What are you talking about? If you're a volcel, that's fine, you're just a normalfag and not an incel.
<comment>
I am not turned on (attracted to) naked fat women, and if I happen to have a boner while walking around because I'm horny, but am only passing fat women, that doesn't imply I'm attracted to them.
<comment>
I think if you did nofap for a week and don't get turned on by BBW porn then you're gay or your brain has been rotted somehow. Plus true femcels exist who can just reject all the short guys ever because they give her the ick.
<comment>
You're only volcel if you're turning down women you'd willingly fuck on any given day.
<comment>
So only hyperchads are volcels by that definition lol.
<comment>
you have less than 10 total rejections
Had 1 rejection and realized I don't want to grovel to be with a woman. I have never heard of people being rejected like you see in movies. Everyone I know just met someone and got together, they were able to easily tell if the woman wasn't interested so was able to prevent embarrassment.
<comment>
uh yeah?
like it is common knowledge that only top tier men get women approaching them
<comment>
Okay then I don't think that counts
What do you mean by that?
<comment>
not true ive had my sisters friends ask me out before
<comment>
shit man must be nice having a sister, I'm about to go home for the summer where I don't have any friends let alone female ones
not that being here at school makes a difference to me I'm bitchless here also
<comment>
So how often are you getting soft rejected?
Well then basically everyone is an incel, which defeats the purpose of the label.
If a girl is "interested" just to exploit you, then I don't think that matters to whether or not you're an incel.
Well then you're quite attractive.
<comment>
roughly a third of young men are incels, not everyone
<comment>
Incels are having a lot of sex, god fucking damn!
<comment>
Perhaps woman was a poor choice of words on my part
We were around 10
<comment>
a fat woman typed this post
<comment>
That might mean something. I don't think kids who are liked by peers grow up to be ugly adults, but it might happen. It'd mean a lot more if you were both 15 or something, though, but Idrk.
I am a man.
<comment>
I mean idk about this graph
I personally fucked a hooker 2 months ago
I think it will be a while if I ever get sex without paying for it
<comment>
you wouldn't date a fat woman
depends how fat
my main line is I don't to date a girl who is morbidly obese. A relative guiding line is if she is average height and somehow heavier than me, then she is likely too fat. I am fairly muscular and stocky of build - not skinny by any means. 
you have less than 10 total rejections
true
but why would I bother if no woman has ever shown interest. worthless goods don't sell if placed on the shelves. If no woman has approached me ever in 30+ years, regardless of societal expectation of who approaches, why should I think I have any value dating-wise?
you wouldn't date a nonvirgin
i don't care about virginity
i would be hesitant to date a girl who has had many, many (like 7+) past relationships or is a divorcee. it shows she likely views relationships/bonds trivially or is the source of why said relationships failed.
you wouldn't consider an LDR
i would
any girl has ever been into you
none have in a romantic context. never even considered a prospect for a relationship.
i declined the only opportunity when a girl pulled me into her room to sleep with me, as I thought she was too drunk to make a terrible decision. I also didn't want my only experience being with a drunk girl I didn't even know at a party in late college. Would rather date a girl first or at least know here somewhat. This likely makes me a volcel by some asinine definition due to not wanting to take advantage of a drunk girl who was so far gone she was considering sleeping with actual human garbage.
<comment>
it is hard to imagine what being an only child is like, but i dont have any friends and only see my sister every couple years now
nah. teen girls go through so many bfs i think they just do it out of boredom
<comment>
it isn't an asinine definition you literally could've had sex lol
oh no the le heckin alcohol
I probably have zero chances of getting any until I'm 21 and can go to bars, alcohol is conducive to intercourse it would seem
<comment>
There's some level of using prostitutes, but I doubt that rate is ~16% of men in the past year lol.
due to not wanting to take advantage of a drunk girl
This is an irrelevant factor. You choosing to have sex or not doesn't affect your incel status, i.e. if you did fuck her you wouldn't be an incel either. You're a volcel given you didn't and you're a normalfag in either case.
teen girls go through so many bfs i think they just do it out of boredom
Not with any ugly guy out of the blue, though, lol.
<comment>
not an only child, I have a brother
but he just ran away from home
so this summer will be my first time ever truly alone at home
<comment>
I'm pretty sure that's what everyone is trying to tell you here.
<comment>
maybe I'm just younger than those ages, but surely it's not that different in 8 months when I turn 20
right now I will say I think not even half of the guys my age (19) at my uni have had sex
<comment>
Then your definition makes the labels meaningless lol.
I don't really care what you think since you're obviously insanely biased. Also, obviously being a virgin doesn't make you an incel. Hence the entire thread.
<comment>
why the sudden aggression? when you say you don't care, did you consider the validity of my claim or did you not even think about it
maybe it's not most, maybe it's 40%, it's still a massive chunk of men my age
<comment>
Do you have any evidence to back that up? I did consider the validity. It might be true, but I doubt it and that's just your feeling, and also virginity across college campuses are probably different from the general population.
<comment>
Yes everyone is unironically a volcel, I wholeheartedly believe that BUT I think what we all call ourselves "incels" is the lowest form of the volcel spectrum. Any 0/10 guy in western society could work for like 2 weeks or even just save up neetbux and travel to another state (or even another country if youre that desperate) where prostitution is legal and fuck a whore. You might get arrested and charged but technically you still had sex and anybody choosing not to do the braindead method I just outlined is a volcel, but that word really means nothing. Incel and Volcel are just used to express where exactly on the spectrum I outlined before you fall into.
<comment>
You could also rape a child or an animal. Obviously people disinclude those as valid ways to end your inceldom for the phrase to have any meaning.
<comment>
virginity is probably less common on campus than off campus if I had to guess
sex definitely increases with age though
if it's a third of 18-30 year old men then that is gonna be lobsided, maybe 40% of those my age are virgins but only 20% of 30 year olds
<comment>
raping a 17 year old puts you in prison for a long time where you will be anally raped yourself
animal isn't exactly appealing lol
<comment>
I fuck hookers, I still don't consider that to be 'getting some', I can't do that without having to pay
I don't associate with the phrase incel bc of connotations, but the anonymity of this site allows me to call myself one right now
<comment>
What is your point, even? They're not incels, still.
You're still having sex, dough.
<comment>
every straight man who isn't abstaining for religious reasons is an incel, if you want to agree to disagree on this one then ok
yeah shagging a sheep is not my definition of sex, raping a 17 year old would be but you will spend decades in prison for that
<comment>
So you're switching from 'everyone is a volcel' to 'all virgins who aren't abstaining for religious reasons aren't volcels' lol. Both viewpoints are retarded but both at once is even more retards.
<comment>
no, the top percent of men who abstain are vocels
most virgins aren't doing so for religious reasons, so about a third of men under 30 are incels
<comment>
That "third" stat is about men 18-30, and a graph was already posted ITT showing 83% of men 20-30 have had sex with a woman in the past year. The actual virgins are largely normalfags, even on /r9k/, so I humbly doubt the ones who aren't degenerates on /r9k/ have a significantly higher proportion of them who are incels.
<comment>
You have to be rejected a arbitrary amount because I said so otherwise somehow you magically are a normie
Because when you were a little child and another little child liked you that means you should be slaying pussy left and right as a adult
You are a delusional dumbass.
<comment>
10 is a really low number of rejections. The actual number I'd put way higher, but most """incels""" have been rejected by less than 2 women lol. Also if you were both like 10 then I doubt that counts, but that's generally not the case for most seething normalfags ITT.
<comment>
also with all of those surveys...men are ashamed to be virgins, women are ashamed to be whores
lying on surveys that deal with something personal like that is very much a factor
also again I don't care about the graph that doesn't include my age, while the "third" stat does
<comment>
The numbers aren't looking very bad for men 18-30.
<comment>
Doubles down on retarded arbitrary criteria
If you haven't done this normalfag thing and failed then you are automatically a normalfag
The stupidity burns.
<comment>
getting rejected countless times makes you a normalfag
Truly genius. We need more trucels like you on /r9k/ who've never lifted a finger to try before.
<comment>
Makes shit up that isn't even close to my point
Then sarcastically mocks the fake shit they made up
Your insistence that people have to be rejected a set number of times otherwise they are a normie is illogical and stupid.
Probably because you are illogical and stupid in general.
<comment>
I just explained that's a bare minimum number that most """incels""" haven't even reached. I can't come up with a perfect number so an arbitrary one has to be chosen and this one is on the smaller end, and obviously if you haven't reached it then it means you've hardly ever tried to get a gf. That's the point.
<comment>
all of this nonsense and liberal logic but no single woman's contact info.
<comment>
20% overall, that's like 30-40% for my age, still far from good, good is sub 5%
<comment>
Good in comparison to the idea that they're largely incels.
<comment>
largely, the fact that like 30% of guys my age haven't gotten laid is pretty bad lol, and 20% of all men under 30
<comment>
Well I don't think those virgins are even close to largely incels.

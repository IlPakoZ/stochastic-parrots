Why do neurotypicals hate ugly autistic women so much?
<comment>
They just hate fat people.

I'm anorexic, I just have an ugly face and flat chested.

This. If you aren't fat as a woman you aren't ugly. Excepting people with literal disfigurements.
<comment>
Then you're not hated, assuming you're actually a woman.

Everyone acts mean to me and says I look like I'm retarded.

Are you underage stiIl?
<comment>
No? I'm 18 and graduating in a month.
<comment>
Close enough. Things will be different when you're out of school.
<comment>
How so? Also I'm worried about graduation because I don't have anybody to hang out with (I have no friends).

 be me, the orgasm-deprived loser
 born with a botched dick thanks to society's fucked up standards
 grow up clueless about the heavenly orgasms I'm missing out on
 hit puberty and realize my mutilated dick isn't like the ones in porn
 learn about the mind-blowing, earth-shattering orgasms intact men experience
 become obsessed with how my life could've been so much fucking better
 unable to shake off the thought of missing out on dick nirvana
 cry like a little bitch, wishing I could go back in time to prevent this disaster
 desperate to understand the true power of an intact orgasm
 spend sleepless nights researching and envying those lucky, uncut bastards
 try to talk to my parents, but they just dismiss me like the morons they are
 my life becomes a never-ending quest to reclaim the orgasms I was denied
 struggling with intimacy, relationships, and self-worth just adds to my misery
 question why the universe decided to fuck me over so hard
 curse the day I was circumcised and the soulless monsters who did it
 drown in depression and suicidal thoughts, all because of my dick's tragic fate
 wish I could turn back time and live life with the orgasms I was meant to have

My golem parents sat idly by as my penis was mutilated as an infant. They fluoride stared as I writhed around in my straps and contraptions. They allowed me to be tortured and permanently damaged for profit. No one saw a problem with it. It happened to millions of other men the same way and no one cared. It's laughable that any parent would expect to be taken care of in old age by their sons when they've done this to them. It's laughable that they would expect anything except hatred and violence from their sons

One of the only ways to get normalgolem to stop cutting up their kids' dicks that actually seems effective is forcing them to pay for the mutilation surgery themselves. Circumcision rates tend to plummet in states where Medicaid stops covering it.

Look I'm not saying this to help you cope. I'm fully intact and my orgasms are meh even after an entire month of nofap.
The only mind blowing orgasms I had were when I was like 12. You're missing out but not as much as you think.

so for me, im cut.
orgasms used to feel amazing. i think...
i've been putting it down to circumcision but if i had to describe it. its like a really feel good feeling, but i dont feel like im going to heaven or something. feels kinda like a low dose of an opiate for a second.
am i fucked or is this just how it is now?

I think growing up and masturbating a lot ruins it for all men. I don't really see intact men praising how amazing their orgasms are. It's usually women who do that.
Not saying cutlets shouldn't be mad tho they should bem

My dick is uncut but my foreskin is too small and most of the time half or fully naked tip.

As a person with an unmutilated cock you're probably a coping cutfag.
Every stroke, where my Ridged Band passes over my glans is like a shot of heroin. Pure ecstasy. Not even kidding.
I have no idea how you guys can live without that feeling and the amazing sense of release it gives.

This. If anything it is too good, being uncut is like having a drug in your pocket. Even just playing with my foreskin feels amazing, the mind blowing blackout inducing orgasm is just a bonus. It feels so good I never want it to end, but when it eventually does I am left fully satisfied, relaxed, happy and destressed and ready to face life head on with no fear or hatred. It's like a much needed reset, all thanks to my foreskin!

i hate life so much and i would kill myself if it wasnt for the singularity and strong ai
FUCK this world i hate being alive so much. im so tired of it
its like im being dragged on to continue living, while im kicking and screaming, because of the singularity
this is honestly the only thing keeping me alive. i would have commited suicide years ago if it wasnt for this
how can anyone endure years and years of loneliness and depression and never experiencing love?
ai and ai alone keeps me alive. maybe also robot-ai gf's as well, that would be nice if it happens

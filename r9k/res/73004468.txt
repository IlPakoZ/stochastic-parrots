Why is it seen as hypocritical that I, a virgin man, want a virgin girlfriend? A virgin should have a virgin, no?

A virgin woman is desirable
A virgin man is undesirable
You two are not the same

Do you get the same number of offers for sex every day that women do? It would be hipocracy if you watch porn and want a virgin girlfriend, and it would be low IQ if you are still a virgin in your 20s. Otherwise, do what you enjoy.

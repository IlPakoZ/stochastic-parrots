Yes. Since the faggots on here used to criticize my grammar on the posts I made a few years back. I made it an effort to proofread and spell check before every reply.
From early 2022 up to now, I've noticed many posters, including Thread makers, make many grammatical errors and nobody shits on them for it,.
They usually miss an entire word (sometimes words) and spell a few words wrong and nobody criticizes them for it.
God forbid I make a mistake. Then it's the end of the fucking world. Yet these third worlders and ESLs can do it all they want and nobody shits on them.
I've seen it so many times that it made me want to call these posters retarded but I'd be letting the people who called me retarded win.

I'm an ESL and I made it a habit to type grammatically correct as good as possible because I kept getting shat on the internet. Even before I was able to speak English that was the case. People will look for mistakes in your posts if they can't find mistakes in your logic. Debating with people in my teens led to this.

they're gonna make love before that volcano kills them

The man is trying to enjoy the view, but the woman is trying to distract him.
He is doing his best, but nonetheless he has a huge boner there, and will try to mate with that woman as soon as he is done appreciating nature.

I don't think that volcano would kill them. It looks like a strombolian kind of volcano to me.

cope, the guy in that image is chad. look at his huge back muscles, and his jaw is probably big too. most men look nothing like the guy in that image. its why she is dancing for him and not us. its unbelievable that the world is this fucked up and unfair. we actually get nothing.

Something serious and meaningful is happening in the back ground but the woman is unaware, she seeks only attention. If the man give it to her they will both be destroyed.

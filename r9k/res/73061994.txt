wake up
just lying in bed with my eyes closed cause too lazy to get up
concentrate really hard 
suddenly summon a photographic image in my mind, in full color and high
can generate a smooth, detailed moving imagery with little effort
I'm not dreaming, I'm fully aware and conscious during the process
try this for several days, it works every time, but only in a brief ~10 min window after waking up, once I'm out of the bed I go back to peasantbrain imagination
What the fuck is this shit and how can this power be harnessed?

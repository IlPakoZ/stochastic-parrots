We missed out on so many key life experiences, while at the same time been through so much shit that we're just broken. 
We're mentally children but also weathered and worn down like elderly people. 
Does anyone understand this feel? I look 16, act 60, feel like a 10 year old
yeah, life is fucking shit
I got rejected by my crush, my life is just like this famous WW2 veteran
ww2
damn you're a dumb fuck. were you parents that stupid too?
you can trivialize my life but i can't trivialize the guy in the picture? rules for thee and not for me, proving my point
He was literally a WW2 soldier
we spend our time consuming others experience on the internet. get off the board and the internet if you want to change that about your life.
this is really true. i feel like in some ways im so behind my peers, but in others ive experienced much more than them.
dumb as shit damn your parents must be two retards

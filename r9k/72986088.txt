I can't sleep during the night no matter how hard I try but I can fall asleep during the day. How do I fix this? I only have insomnia when I have to go to work in the morning. I tried melatonin and I think I'm immune.

You're taking too much
If you overload yourself it doesn't work. Try cutting the pills in half and they'll probably work better

Tried small doses and big doses, nothing works.

oh I'm sorry.
I'm not sure, have you tried learning breathing exercises?

Yeah I tried breathing exercises but those don't work either.

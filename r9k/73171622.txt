Yeah a lot of big mosques have one of the clergy members assist with matchmaking. Catholic priests will do this too but that's not as common in American culture.

I converted to Muslim a few years ago. Lots of Islamic whores between america, Saudi Arabia and Dubai. However if you go to some of the other countries that aren't popular, you'll find a decent woman who will give you a huge family, want you to marry other women, &amp; be faithful to you, listening to everything that you say and do. However, you need to find an Islamic woman who isn't westernized. But then you also can't bring them to your country if it's mostly been westernized by America. You would need to move to her country and bring Western money with you this way you can live like a king.

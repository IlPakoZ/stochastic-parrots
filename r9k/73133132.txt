Statistically saying, yes, but we still lack the statistics on incels in this age in the future. But most incels ended up making good money so far when they got older, and most incels (you can find quite a few in this board, including me) managed to have sex after a while. I don't think this trend will last though

>YOU WILL FIND A GIRLFRIEND. 
I don't think I want one at this point. It'd be too much effort and people are two-faced. I've had some in the past though.
>YOU WILL MAKE A SHITLOAD OF MONEY.
How? Feels like jobs are a myth, desu. Going to college was a joke. (inb4 dipshits assuming I went meme degree or had a shit gpa or never tried to go for the "jobs nobody wants")
>YOU WILL BE HAPPY.
It comes and goes I guess.
>YOU WILL MAKE IT.
I hope so.

Why was the no pictures of yourself rules established? I wish I could post pictures of myself on here to get genuine advice and not reddit tier shit. Inb4 I know other incel forums exists but I don't want to be put on a list.

It was originally established because a board exists just for that >>>/soc/
I'd recommend checking it out if you're gay and you want your ass rimmed by an old man

Why isn't talking about video games banned on here when that is what /v/ is for?

The rules are literally at the top of the page, no one is here asking for your input.

because /r9k/ is full of malicious schizos who think its funny to post your photo over and over again with poor bait. you can report and complain all you want but once your pic is on the internet and someone finds out you want it gone you can bet your ass they're going to do everything they can to immortalize it.
thats why you post that shit on /soc/ if you have to post it.

Just post a picture and say what do you think of this random guy that isn't me? The rule is not to post pictures of yourself, so just don't admit it's you, mongo.

If It is on soc, would it just find its way to r9k anyway?

there is no way to prevent it but its less likely to stand out in an ocean of other losers vying for attention. personally i dont recommend posting a picture of yourself on 4chan in general. most browsers dont give a shit but lack of moderation always attracts the biggest faggots with internet access.

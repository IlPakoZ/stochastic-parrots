2 yrs passed. Ended funky because it was a weird "are we friends or more than that" kind off thing. It was mostly my fault too. 

Here's what I was going to send: 
"Hi.. so I know it's been a while and things ended a little weird, but I was wondering if you'd be okay with being friends again?"

Is that okay? Btw she was kind of ghosting me throughout the end so.. maybe I shouldn't bother. We were friends for like a year, but it started to crash when we were no longer seeing each other in person. I can't tell if this is beyond repair or not. I mean she ghosted me for a reason, right? Like to say "I don't want anything to do with you anymore", right?

I mean if you miss talking to them then sure, go for it.
Probably best to apologize but in an extremely impersonal/professional/sterile way, that way you are likely to be perceived as sincere while also not desperately attached. What you wrote sounds fine though honestly

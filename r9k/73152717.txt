Femanons, just lose weight. It's that simple. If you don't get male attention and feel ugly, just lose weight and get fit and toned and then follow proper hygiene and suddenly you'll get male attention. It's just that easy. Men are WAY more forgiving in terms of looks than women are. For men, they have problems that they can't fix, e.g. being short, small dick, bad face, bald, etc. The only physical problem for women is weight, which you yourself can control.

The biggest problem of women is their brain, they are unable to recognize what they are wrong with so they will never listen to you when you try to help them

Women dont want to be fixed but rather involve you into bitching about problems.

See, the problem is none of you will admit that the "just lose weight" standard will apply forever with no end in sight, even far below a BMI of 20. 
No bitch is ever skinny enough for you losers, at least say so.

A BMI of 20 is considered overweight, lardass.

They can still get men interested in them despite being fat, its just not the type of men they are attracted to.

Skeletons are not hot, women need some fat on them that you could rub, fondle and slap around.
Real problem is proportions, and you can't always do much about that.

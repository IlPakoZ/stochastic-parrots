Should have gone to the gym. I went back to Uni after being a NEET at 26 and even doe i didn't do shit before, I was a gym addict and took care of myself. Getting laid wasn't a problem.

I can only imagine. I did it at 23 and hated life. 
Everyone is just so...weird. The few people I could sorta relate to were too awkward to actually hang out with simply because they were too timid. 
Everyone else was nice but they were turbonormies. Something about people that are happy for no reason really pushes my buttons. 
>"Hey anon good morning how are you? How far have you gotten on (insert fucking individual assignment here)?"
Jesus fucking Christ, I just woke up leave me alone faggot. 
The curse of using the GI bill I guess. You come out on the other end too jaded to actually enjoy the personalities you find at college and the other vets are so stuck in the past you feel like you're back "at work" when talking to them.

This isn't a real phenomenon but then again both men and women fear me. 
I had better success when I was still their age and I'd just walk around campus at night looking for chicks to chat with.

Getting laid is actually pretty easy once you stop giving a fuck imo.

Stop telling people your age, LARP like you're 21.
I finished high school at 22 and I just pretended to be a normal kid the entire time, wasn't so bad.

I mean, assuming he even can.
Stress aged me a bit and I get five oclock shadow if I don't shave every morning. 
Friends of friends that are 30+ are shocked when they find out I'm in my 20s.

Even if he can't he can at least be "that old guy who is really friendly and still parties". build a reputation.

People go to get their masters in their late 20's, and also I took a bunch of classes with people in random age groups (30-60 year olds) and I literally didn't give a shit.

Yeah if you go to a big, in-person campus school. Those are for 18 year olds trying to do the "muh college experience" thing, not boomers. Protip: if you're starting college past 21 go to an urban school (something like University of Illinois-Chicago or City University of New York or any "University of (state)-(major city)" type school. Those schools are way more anonymous and robot friendly than big campus schools since you have loads of regular urban professionals just finishing up their degrees or whatever. Alternatively, you can just go online now. After coof every single state system offers fully online degrees that are indistinguishable from their on-campus options.

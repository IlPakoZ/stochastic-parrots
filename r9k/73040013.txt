How come korean and white bait threads get to stay, while posts lambasting the thread misser for being lazy gets taken down ?

I think the situation should be reverse, more leebait, less racebait.

The race bait threads are posted by one guy who's just as big a loser as Lee, he's just not as much fun.

No but I had an hours-long conversation with him across a great many bait threads. He's a cuck who used to post BBC bait to get off but has pivoted to posting Korean bait because he thinks it's funnier. He reminds me of Lee in terms of his limitless posting stamina and the repetitive, low-effort nature of his posts.

I see, I suppose he is mentally ill in some form, no ?
though I may have to disagree with
>low-effort nature of his posts
Thread misser needs to concoct new threats as not to get filtered
you must have a lot of patience conversing with him

I assume so but I didn't ask. You tend to just assume these things with cucks.

I'm not saying Lee or the racebaiter don't put any effort into their posts, exactly, but they sure don't put any thought into them or make much attempt to communicate normally with people. What these two guys have in common is that they're both posting for their own weird reasons that they don't care to explain to the people they annoy.

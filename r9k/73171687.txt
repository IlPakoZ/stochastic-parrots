If it's morning where you are you don't live in a real country

Daily reminder that this poster is a slut.
>>73171764
What else do you expect out of attention whores?
--- 73171780
>>73171764
yes, i wake up too early because of the time change and i am bored
>>73171768
you were on vacation together with your gf and i still saw you posting about it here non stop lol, you're one to talk.
--- 73171782
>>73171687 (OP)
Good morning, look at this pretty little purple bird
--- 73171794
>>73171687 (OP)
good morning anon, got some new fish for my fish tank and a few new vinyl :3 day is good
--- 73171797
>>73171782
I like your bird, here is one in return.
--- 73171801
>>73171782
so cute! she matches my hassan of serenity
--- 73171811
>>73171794
ooh what type of fish do you have, and how many? glad your day is good, im going to go thrift shopping today for my last day and i really hope to have a good day too ,finding nice stuff for cheap
--- 73172015
>>73171768
are you really calling anyone an attention whore? Either you or your gf often post threads 4-5 times a day and you constantly derail unrelated threads trying to make them all about you.
--- 73172029
>>73171768
>ywn massage iris like this
--- 73172042
>>73172015
lol right? if i was meeting up to hang out with the apparent love of my life, i would not be posting on r9k the whole time
--- 73172057
>>73172042
I think he is jealous you get more attention, which to be fair is undeserved and because you are a woman but you cant really help that. I dont really care if you happen to be a whore, 99.9% of women are so that is not uniquely bad, and further you make that poster seethe so keep posting threads please. I do hate women though I just want to put that out there.
--- 73172074
>>73171780
That was just to troll retards lol. It's funny as fuck when there were so many schizos claiming she was underage or that we were the same person or that she's fat because she made 2 posts talking about eating. 
>>73172015
>you are X so you can't call anyone X
No lol.
>>73172057
I can easily make threads that get triple the replies of the successful threads she makes lmao, which are often only successful because I allow them to be bumped a shit ton. You can easily make posters here seethe without having to promote an attention whore/actual whore. It's funnier to make the simps seethe than people who just hate women lol.
--- 73172079
>>73172074
Look how hard she's trying!!
Awwweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
--- 73172089
>>73172074
You literally beg for attention on here basically constantly almost everyday. I sit and watch it and am baffled at the sheer amount you seem to need.
>I can easily make threads with triple the replies
Okay do it then. 
>I allow it to be bumped
lol.
--- 73172105
>>73171687 (OP)
Morning, make sure to drink water fren
>>73172074
I've only seen your threads recently and most of them are replying to the anyway frogposter
--- 73172116
>>73172079
Who is he talking to?
>>73172089
>You literally beg for attention on here basically constantly almost everyday
Lmao what are you talking about?
>Okay do it then.
Post dc and I'll show you tomorrow.
>lol.
I mean I help bump the thread by posting in it. I post so much a lot of threads would die much faster if I didn't post in them.
>>73172105
You've only seen like 3 out of 300 threads I've made recently then lmfao.
--- 73172118
Hello, I just wrote a test and I probably failed it. Oh well I'll get them next time.
--- 73172122
going to ignore his posts cause he just wants to ruin my nice comfy thread with his obsessive hatred of me. anyone want to talk? 
>>73172057
i hate men too so its fine 
yes the attention is undeserved, but its easy enough to get replies as a male here if you just post cute anime girls and are unclear about your gender
--- 73172125
>>73172105
Holy fuck I love that guy the reply comparison cracks me up
I hope he comes back though, he said he might not after the pedo stuff
--- 73172131
>>73171768

can you comment on the veracity of this analysis of your behaviour? >>73166280 →

is it true that you actually believe those are genuine? or is it just to 'make simps seethe'? how do you feel about the fact that zero (0) simps believe the screencaps are legit?
--- 73172135
>>73172116
>what are you talking about
>constantly posting humblebragging threads or literally ordering your gf like a dog to post them
I figured out what to do with you I guess, you are like an attention zombie. If people just withdraw attention you throw tantrums. It would be cute if you werent so malicious most of the time. 
>>73172122
no you dont understand I HATE women. 
>easy enough to get replies 
eh. I am pretty severely autistic so all I get is people telling me to sui, it is what it is.

Last time someone did this to him, he had an absolute meltdown lol. Looking forward to watching him sperg in this thread.

He got so irritated by the random spelling thing he latched onto it heavily made it clear he was deranged

It's just fanfiction written by someone who's in-love with an eslut.

They're braindead cultists. I'm not surprised.
>>73172135
>ordering your gf like a dog to post them
Lol what? She asks me to make cute threads too. They're fun and cute.
>>73172141
>what pedo stuff happened?
People took the in-joke about diapies to mean we're both pedophiles, but neither of us are actually unironically into diapers so it just comes across as really desperate and cringe.
>>73172145
Lmao so desperate.

--- 73172195

I care about normalfags LARPing like they're suffering like incels or like they're lonely. OP does this a lot. Practically any self-proclaimed """fembot""" is doing this.

Being into diapers doesn't make you a pedo lol, and it was just a meme anyway.
--- 73172221
>>73172198
holy shit it all comes together. They also post lots of anime girls youd expect a pedo to post. Damn I didnt know they were that kind of people.
--- 73172234
>>73172145
I'm talking about an actual tranny thread - someone was trying to have a conversation about hrt and he kept butting in with weirdly smarmy-yet-empty responses. soon as anon moved on to talking to someone who actually knew what they were talking about, he starts freaking out like a kid accusing everyone of trolling him. 
>>73172141
>>73172150
here is the ratified primer on tk and rs >>73152912 → i think the pedo stuff is just to make them seethe because they are basically normies when it comes to bait vulnerability but tbf neither of them really deny being normies, they accept they arent neets or incels and are mostly here to troll chuds or whatever
--- 73172236
>>73172221
They also baby talk to each other and Retard-san posts come across as purposely infantile
--- 73172241

--- 73172293
I usually don't mind tranny kun. He just reminds me of similar pseud shitposting avatarfags like kryst. Has anybody else noticed he seems a lot less cool and collected recently, though? Like the "tells" that he is rattled start to show up a lot quicker nowadays.

I'm guessing Iris' shoulders are probably well muscled from gymnastics.
--- 73172309
>>73172300
I could write a book on it. Mostly they enforce societal norms heavily and all want the same thing. Also every one I have talked to was superficial/boring, and I talked to a lot in the past.
>come to canada
No. Someone I had a crush on is in Canada I have a bad association with the state.
--- 73172322

he buts into threads all the time just to start arguments or make people sad. my threads have been comfier lately now that i just focus on the decent people. i hope people stop falling for his instigating

good morning! im doing better than earlier this week, things are ok. howbare you? and i'm 5'4. i didn't measure my shoulders, but they are much wider than my ribcage which is around 34-35

so youve spoken to a couple women who act a certain way and hate us all for it, not surprised. why even enter my thread or speak to me if you feel this way, i dont like you.

Women always resort to social shaming in their insults:
you are weird, you are a virgin, you are creepy, you have no friends, etc.
Also they heavily select for outgoingness, talkativeness, social dominating things, etc. I can be those things if I force myself, hence my prior moderate success with women, but I hate they will never like me for who I am and only as a clown performing the function of being what they want. Also their lives are easier than mine in regards to finding people and talking to people, I have always been alone and they can find someone within minutes of downloading an app or posting somewhere. That would be fine but almost none of them will admit they have this aspect of life easier. Also also 99.9% of men simp hard for women and it is annoying watching them put on a high pedestal just for something they didnt control.
--- 73172571
>>73172413

you probably look much better than you think desu, did you ever post pics of yourself here? im curious about how you look. and how tall are you?

>>73172488
i don't social shame in my insults, even if someone is genuinely acting creepy i try not to use those words. also i dont care about outgoingness, etc, since i wouldn't want to date someone who talks to a lot of girls and goes out all the time. so i guess you are wrong. 
>Also their lives are easier than mine in regards to finding people and talking to people
that's fair i guess, but its not our fault. not fair to hate us for the actions of other men
--- 73172621
>>73172596
I dont believe that but I will give you benefit of the doubt, if so then congrats on breaking out of that shell. Really the boringness is likely because they never have to lead or initiate conversations if they dont want, so that is up in the air on who to blame.
I realize several of these are to blame on men, I dont like that men blanketly simp for women either.
--- 73172626
>>73172595
Sure. I'll help you then. An example of what she does that a lot of women also do is play the victim in ridiculous ways and attention whore. I don't hate women, but she's not even close to like a counterexample of shit women lol.

i don't mean it in a creepy way or anything, i just wanna know
--- 73172737
>>73172679
what did i do?
>>73172696
>i just choose not to interact with them
then why do you keep on replying to me
--- 73172813
>>73172728
Its more like they just seem to have those interests for social benefit. Maybe that is just a normalfag thing, and I only got aggravated with women having it because I was romantically interested in them. Maybe it is just a normalfag thing.
>>73172737
Do you want me to stop? I am not being very hostile to you.
--- 73172823
Iris, what time is it over there that you're saying good morning at this time of day!?!?! 
My greetings to you, I hope your day has been pleasant so far?

>>73172823
Liar. Said youd stop avatarfagging.
--- 73172882
>>73172836
Fuck, I broke my promise. I'm sorry. I just wanted to talk to Iris as Mio. I'll not do that again from this point on. I'll add a day to what I was planning to do. I'll do 4 days without avatarfagging now.

>>73172882
Dont write checks you cant cash.
--- 73172900
>>73172813
>they just seem to have those interests for social benefits
imo it's very easy to tell when someone is genuinely into something, vs when they're doing it just for attention/validation. and i've seen girls who do both
>Do you want me to stop? I am not being very hostile to you.
i'm just curious, why you keep talking to someone you hate so much
>>73172823

>>73172882
why are you not avatarfagging? don't get bullied into appeasing someone who's rude
--- 73172919
>>73172900
I think every normalfag only does it for social benefit. I am a bit jaded though.
>talking to someone I hate
I hate you categorically, not personally, if anything I like you a tiny bit because you make that couple upset and they harassed me frequently.
--- 73172921
>>73172900
The whole day's been extremely painful, to say the least, but I'm feeling better now. Painful mentally.
--- 73172930
>>73172907
Usually I wouldn't give a shit, but I think that not avatarfagging might have some mental health benefits for me. I don't have to put up nearly as much of an identity as I did with an avatar on. It's a bit freeing, like walking around the house naked or something.
Don't worry, you'll probably see me back someday. It's hard to resist the avatarfagging urge!

No, I also think you're very cute! Cute spelled C-U-T-E.

>>73173015
Please give me at least a few days, anon. I won't stop avatarfagging forever!
--- 73173129
>>73172919
honestly, lots of normalfag have genuine interests besides climbing the social hierarchy, you'd be surprised. probably when you're mentally healthy and happy you have the energy and time to be interested in more hobbies
>>73172921
what happened?
im sorry to hear that
>>73172930

>>73173129
>what happened?
I know it's a disappointing answer, but I'd rather not talk about it. Maybe when you get back home, I can tell you the story on Discord?
>i see what you mean, i take off the avatar for certain posts, it can be helpful
I think I am honest to a fault, so I usually try to be consistent with my identity whenever I'm on here. I don't like not avatarfagging!

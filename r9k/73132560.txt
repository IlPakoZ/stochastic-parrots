Eh I'm a sucker for the life of adventure stuff, so that. Warrior class for sure. A lot of the other options sound great as well, I love memes like these.

Is some vague adventure really worth the chance of dying from cholera in the middle of nowhere?

Adventure if I can do an immortality spell as a wizard. Otherwise, the not aging part of leisure if just too good, and it has more things to do than good works.

A life of comfort without a doubt, are you kidding? Fuck all the supernatural shit I would kill to have a decent life like that without having to violently struggle for it. I could pursue anything I want without having to worry about finances. I could live the normal life I always wanted to have. But most of all, I would have someone who loves me completely without the nonsense of the modern era.

It's an easy choice for me without a doubt. I've had, and still live, a very hard life.

Definitely. Although if I have perfect human strength and health, hopefully it wouldn't be to something so lame. I live a life of general comfort / lesiure already and it's fairly boring.

Sounds like being a dentist but quadruple the salary.

Adventure. I love fantasy worlds and hope I can be cured of my disability affecting muscle strength and balance and my heart requirements of heart medicine 

I would be a wizard

This would literally be the most fun I'd ever have in my life and I would kill to have this power. I didn't even read the other options fuck them

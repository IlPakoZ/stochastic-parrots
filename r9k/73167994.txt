Think I might commit suicide soon

Same desu. I want to try to have some fun before it thought. My life is definitively broken far past the point of non-return or even coherency, so I might just be a happy schizo for some months and blow all my welfare before getting the needle in Belgium.

suicide sounds easy enough but once you get there you'll be looking for any reason not to. you have to be in a truly hopeless situation to really go through with it .

I've found a bullet in the woods while hunters were next by do you think if I holded it between my teeth and smash it with a hammer and a nail it'd detonate?

Smoke and drink, it might bring you from the brink is the saying. I can get psychiatrist assisted at the psych unit too. Because my whole life is fucked.

I already found a reason to. No woman is ever going to commit to me. I won't back out at all I don't think, just steady drug abuse until death

Tried pot yet?

Maybe but it wouldn't kill you. Don't do that

Picked up legal-recreational earlier. No dice. I just want something other than drugs, unfortunately

>>73168477
Do you know any good methods? I have a small amount of money and am thinking of buying rope

I don't know why, but I've always believed that suicide reincarnates you. I've just always sort of known. Decided I didn't want to roll the dice with how many parents and indians are born every second.

Me too. But then I realized how much preparation that would involve. Clearing all my devices, throwing out stuff, giving my friends stuff, cleaning my room, cleaning myself, planning the place, method, making sure it will be the least painful/most effective. Its all shit. I wish I could just happen to stand on a 20 story building and jump without thinking of any embarrassing stuff my parents could find while cleaning my room or looking for answers.

Perhaps if you achieve children you also achieve regeneration. Or something like that. We would all hate to become a ghost or an angel but life is ridiculously gay and love is impossible to find. If it weren't for alcohol I'd have succeeded the first time I tried

>>73168677
Simple, order drugs or heat a sharp blade and keep at it. Easy to do even with an extension cord. If I were triggered I'd do it right now. Who gives a fuck what they find on your PC? You don't live anymore to see the consequences.

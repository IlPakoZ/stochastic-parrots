Why do millennials struggle so much with accepting hardship? Literally every generation in human history was able to endure hardship, internalize it, and then move on. But not millennials. They need to fucking stew in their anger, and act indignant when the world leaves them behind.

Life is Darwinian. Life is hardship. You are not entitled to a life of happiness. Happiness is entirely predetermined. It's out of your hands.

Idiotic and overly generalised post. Do you not think people in the past who lived during hard times hated their lives and wished for death/change? Just because people endure hardship doesn't make then happy/satisfied with life. And If I were to live life in the most "darwinian" way possible, I'd just go around raping/impregnaiting as many women as possible to secure my "genetic lineage", not so logical now is it? You're clearly someone who's had a coddled easy life or someone who thinks being a spiteful "suck it up" hardass makes you more enlightend because you clearly can't comprehend how difficult life can be for people. Existentialism is not something new and has always been apart of human thought/discussion. Also the fact that you can't comprehend people born in less prosperous and more culturally turbulent times are less happy just shows how much of a pleb you are.

Boomers are hedonistic degenerates who destroyed the fabric of society and sold their countries to foreign interests.
They HATE when people point this out and always try to blame younger generations in the same way they were shat on for sex, drugs and murder, which when you look at the stats all peaked with boomers so all their shitting on younger gens is nonsensical projection.

The same with this, >>73173617 boomers grew up at the easiest time to live in history and try to say the same thing about other generations when it makes absolutely no sense
It's not 2019 anymore, nobody buys the "most prosperous greatest time in history" bullshit while everything is so blatantly going to shit.

I'm not sure you know what you are talking about melenials group up on the line of poverty. 1950s Is when America had it's big economic boom and a single man could support his family on am average income. Inflation was pretty much non existent at that point. The average adult could get a house and have it paid off in 5 years.

What changed was capitalism is a rigged system in which businesses go pretty much unchecked, so they kept taking advantage kept taking advantage and keep taking advantage until by time the millennial were kids and young adults all the stuff you could do decades prior is pretty much impossible.

Heck Gen xers had it easier than milligrams the 90s although faced some inflation, had things pretty easy and simple in terms of living and being able to afford things.

Boomers and Gen xrs really dropped the ball for melenials, I imagine zoomers and young mellinials are pretty much ed fucked now.

they are doing well now but they told me about how all the people in 2001 who were taking out mortgages got taken for a ride and how after everyone got houses at a good cost it gave the real estate companies leverage to skyrocket the price. Gen xers and boomers are also responsible for voting for intimate domain laws which basically allows companies to go to the courts and lobby to buy plots of land then buy your property(for a lower price than you paid) and tear it down to build their businesses.

Boomers fucked everyone over and gave birth to Xers without teaching them anything who in turn couldn't teach us even what they wanted us to know. Boomers allowed this to happen, but they are very weak both spiritually and mentally. They were manipulated by an evil force. It's not that boomers are evil, they are conduits for evil. 
I think things have gotten bad enough people are starting to wake up see evil for what it is. The evil is deeply entrenched in the system so the only winning move is to not play. It's too late to exercise. I've been in the process of dropping out the last year and have felt a lot better for it. Some people can drop out easier than others, but everyone can help at least a little bit. Become a radical by going to church, milking a goat, cooking dry beans, planting a flower.

Prior generations didn't have poisons being pumped into their bodies daily thereby weakening their ability to deal with hardship. Free testosterone is needed for men to deal with high stress situations and it is rapidly declining in modern men purely because of these poisons. Not only that but other generations struggled because there was something to be gained by that struggle, a light at the end of the tunnel, grinding away in modern society just isn't worth it anymore. This isn't a viewpoint only shared by millennials either, plenty of generations raised during the end stages of other civilizations felt this way as well.

and you're constantly reminded of how good and easy other people have it. growing up people were constantly talking about and admiring rich and attractive celebrities, looking at pictures of their life and house and by doing so making sure those celebrities got paid just to document their awesome life.
also, every generation didn't sit down and let rich people ruin their lives, peasant uprisings happened all the time in the past. its just that until the French revolution none of them had really managed to spark it up to a nation wide conflict.

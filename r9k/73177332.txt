Some things never change. Men have been cursed to obsess over boobs since the beginning of time.

To my understanding though, substantially large boobs have only really been a recent thing due to modern diets, and they are already rare enough today as it is, which kind of kills my fantasy of being sent back in time to some prehistoric village and romancing a homely tribal girl who happens to have an enormous chest.

Anon I think about this daily. I live in a country where almost nobody has big boobs and it's such a shame. I cannot date a flat chested girl. I just cant!

I would think that the fact that time travel doesn't exist would be a bigger problem with that fantasy

Russian girls usually have huge jugs I have noticed.

Yeah maybe Russians but not Finns.
Finnish women are picky sluts but have no ass, no tits, and they look 50 when they hit 30.

All of my problems in life are caused by the fact I'm Finnish.

Everybody always thinks girls of other nations have bigger boobs. In Japan everybody thinks nordic women have giant breasts.

Honestly mate, Finland has 5 million people.
Do you know how much that narrows down every prospect in your life? Fewer jobs, fewer women, much less variance in opinions... it's an inbred people

Something is fundamentally wrong with the way I model reality around me. It's like I live in a dream. What is wrong with me?

Maybe you disassociate due to trauma. I used to do that when I was younger.

What the fuck does dissociation mean? It's a meme. Boohoo I stare at walls for fun because my imagination is big

It's a nice feeling. I'm not even sure if I experience dissociation, It feels like I'm a kid again and don't know anything.

I LOVE being a woman. I love dressing up how I want and being accepted regardless. I can wear a dress and be treated professionally, I can wear sweats and a hoodie and people will think Im slummy and cute. I can wear something revealing and be applaudedfor dressing fierce. I can do my make up, or I can go no make up and be called naturally beautiful. I love being heard and seen, even if my problems are miniscule. Almost everything in life has been handed to me, and if it wasntI was spoon fed it. I love being nurturing and taking care of people. Nothing makes me feel better than being looked at as a healer. I love putting others before myself. I love not having to go to a job, and instead take care of my future husband andfamily while being a homemaker. I want to be someones home one day. Although being a woman is great, I think men and women bring out the better in each other. A man helps me with heavy lifting and I will cook him dinner, rub his back and do his laundry. Men and women are a great team when we set our differences aside and start working together.

Trans women are still women even though they're not biowomen.

no matter how perfect and solved women lives are, they still live in permanent longing tedium and depression

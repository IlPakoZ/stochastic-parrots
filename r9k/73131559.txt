Did a breed of dog bred specifically for beastiality ever exist?

There are so many extant and extinct breeds of dog for nearly every conceivable purpose, and (as disgusting as it may be) beastiality has been taboo for a surprisingly short amount of time. Hell, even today, it's probably one of the most common taboos. Thus, it would make logical sense for there to be at least *one* example of a dog bred for such a purpose. So... why isn't there one? Did one ever exist? Is it possible that a still-extant dog breed may have once been intended for this purpose, and its original purpose has simply been largely forgotten?

I want to cave your face in. I want to see your blood splattered on the pavement and hear the scattering of your teeth knocked loose from your skull.

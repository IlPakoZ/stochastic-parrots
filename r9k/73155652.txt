Many of the non-action shows taught people really bad messages in the 90s and beyond

>Hey Arnold &amp; Doug


People swooning over one person.Shit like that only leads to heartbreak and possible trouble with the school. People should be trying to hit on multiple people and keep their options open. More than likely the girl you are crushing on is talking to 3 other people real talk. One episode Doug got in a shitty situation because another girl asked him out, wtf is that shit? Simp shit, simping over one bitch leads to stalker shit.
No feelings till you dick is in the vagina.

 While Johny Bravo and Ryo Saiba are demonized for hoping bitch to bitch.

>Sponge bob
Mediocrity
Promotes mediocrity and staying in place. Always stuck in a shitty situation and never betters oneself. Shonen heroes are about the hussle staying true to ones goals etc.


>Code Lyoko
Friends above all else, like a scholarship or etc. Majority of your friends from highschool/ middleschool are going to be fuck ups and you will grow past them


IDK man, after the dip in action cartoons in the 90's there was some really shitty messages in kids shows.

I think the only thing that kid shows teach kids that is seriously misleading is that they will be accepted for who they are despite their personality quirks and physical appearance.The things you mentioned hit when they kids grow up and they deal with it but having this expectation of universal acceptance led to major disappointments and sadness in my early life. I would have fared off better if I was told to change myself atleast my personality and learn to be more acceptable to others. I did it eventually but far too late.

That's only the gay later episodes, the first two season were overwhelmingly wholesome

A lot of the early episodes of spongebob taught some good lessons, I always think back to procrastination, which was a pretty good depiction of what can happen when you're lazy and put things off.

just because one aspect of the show (spongebobs mediocrity and lack of upward movement in life) exists doesn't mean the entire thing is bad.

>Hey Arnold

It's pretty normal for young people to swoon over one person. But did you miss season 1? Arnold fantasized about Ruth despite knowing little about her. And when he got to actually get to know her, he realized she was a mean-spirited and shallow person. He learned the object of his affection didn't match his fantasy, and moved on. That was the point. 

Other than that, Jim Jenkins intended for Doug and Patti to never hook up to teach kids that you're 99% not going to marry whoever you liked in middle-school, they're only your first love because of a lack of options (because he named Patti after his own 6th grade crush. In an interview he describes visiting her 40 years later...and meeting her husband)

Doug was pretty relatable to the problems of 12 year-olds. The problem is that viewers didn't want to be relate to Doug, because they didn't want to be reminded of their own lameness. They wanted to relate to Bart Simpson or superheroes

still, he doesn't grow sticks around at a shitty job, can't get his license.

for a fucking season.....
Johnny bravo moves from bitch to bitch easy, so does Ryo Saiba.

Then he swooned over another bitch the next season
COME THE FUCK ON!

>Doug was pretty relatable to the problems of 12 year-olds. 
Puberty didn't hit me till 8th grade. All these shows also made kids act older than they were 

>doug acts like highschooler
>TMNT 87 acted like toons, 03 acted like they were mid 20s with Donatello acting as though he was 30, 12 acted like teens, and rise acted like they were in college

>tiny toons acted like they were in college
>rugrats acted like they were about six or so

the list goes on,

Spongebob loves his job, which he single-handedly turned around for its owner, and is basically renowned for his talent. Even though he can't get his license, he basically never gives up, that's the lesson.

>>73156695
Problem is it is a shit job, and they show that he is living above the realistic means of said shit job.
--- 73156842
>>73156695
But his boss doesn't give him a raise or really respect him beyond "meh, he's an ok fry cook".
If you're not giving up in a correct way, yeah, that can fuck you up...but not giving up even in a shit position like his is retarded.
I've worked in a similar position to his, and if you don't grow your brain to where you think "hey maybe I should get a license and like, not be here" then you legitimately are retarded.

He doesn't climb past his job. The few times he "did" were out of fantasy (like himself imagining he's a movie star in one early episode). He even wanted to marry one of his mediocre fast food creations, that's how boring and sad his existence is. He copes with the mediocrity of his life. If he aged to 21, you bet your ass he comes home drunk irl.

For the record, I love SpongeBob, but to get lessons beyond the very rare episodes like "Split Pants" is kinda silly.

Actually I concede on one point, but if you did it in real life you would go to prison.

...he used the secret patty formula to sell Pretty Patties.
But that shows even further how sad his life is, to where he sells the formula for his burgers back to Krabs so he gets access to the KK again.

He doesn't think beyond his one position he thinks he's perfect at, after that one episode where the Original Fry Cook returns and claps his ass while subtly telling him he should fucking leave so he gets a real life like himself.
--- 73156889
I have never seen a show as shitty, nihilistic and depressing as this piece of shit. From what I remember of every episode, it was just

>horrific situation after horrific situation happens until the main character has a breakdown

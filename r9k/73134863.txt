Back in high school, I had a friend named Amy who was a chronic hair twirler. She basically always had a lock of hair in her hand, incessantly twirling and twirling and twirling...

I thought about her today as I noticed a guy in my office twirling his hair. And so I wondered, do you twirl your hair?

I am bald. But I have a mustache. I like twirling my mustache. Am I now a woman?

I feel an intense urge to twirl mine when the other person in the conversation begins talking about higher concepts in philosophy...

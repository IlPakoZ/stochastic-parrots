how is one supposed to cope with the fact their brain is mentally ill? 

when i was younger i wanted to be a schizo. i failed. i wanted to be a sociopath. i failed. i wanted to never cry. i succeeded however i can still feel everything and now have one less way to cope. thru all of that my brain ended up.. as a mix of everything and nothing. difficult to describe. it goes out of it's way to make things as difficult as possible sub-consciously hence pic related. is there a way out? how do i go back? where are the refunds?

I don't think you're just mentally ill; I think you're also probably retarded

Everyone is "mentally ill" nowadays. The world has lost its all meaning so suck it up buttercup.

That hairline is a slow-motion train wreck.

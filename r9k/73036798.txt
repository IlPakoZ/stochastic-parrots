A dialogue has started about touch starvation recently. I found myself chuckling bitterly that robots don't realize how much harder it is for a female going through this.

Nice bait thread.
But in the extremely small off-chance this isn't bait, being touch-starved as a woman is literally a non-issue. You can solve it in a couple hours by going on Tinder or going to a bar, you'll have countless men throwing themselves at you almost immediately.

People like you are the problem. For men touch always has to escalate to something sexual, so girls are afraid to even hug a guy at the fear of being called a "tease" or "slut leading guys on".

>People like you are the problem.
What's the problem here exactly? If you want to feel the touch of a male its going escalate to sex. 

If you don't want sex then die alone simple as. 

You roasties really are something else:
>NOOO I want BF treatment from men but wont give them BF benefits 
>I just want to receive attention and affection but have absolutely NO interest to give affection to men. 

Again, die alone. 

You aren't incel, robot , or any variant of those things. What you ARE is a fucking emotional leech. A slug. A parasite.

Wow. Woman tries to milk pity and attention.
I'm shocked.

if it's worth anything? those anons aren't to blame. they're just younger.
i'm reminded of a certain animal instinct where if the offspring is touched by a human then the parents will never interact with that offspring ever again.

>>73037245
why the fuck would you want to touch a woman you can't fuck?

>yeah stacy gave me a hug then went home to get railed in all holes by chad, but at least im not "touch starved"

lmao.

>>73036904
hug a woman then.

women need to stop pretending that lack of a man's touch is that detrimental compared to vice versa

it's extremely frustrating, it's been over a year for me. it's damn near miserable.

If you were actually not a slut, I would give you the hug without expecting the sex happily. The problem is that you ARE a slut and you just don't want sex with me because I am ugly. This is why I decline to participe in this interaction that may help you but hurts me.

I disagree with this image. Women depend on men every day to stay alive.
--- 73037341
>>73037318
But they get men support directly from simps or indirectly from waggies. This is way they don't have partners and feel ok. And this is why we need to kill simps and start No pussy No work.
--- 73037347
The claim and assumption that a fembot would have it 'much harder' is probably stemming from the same reason you're touch starved: stupidity.

Sluts are getting a lot more than hugs ...and from dudes who are taller, stronger and have larger cocks than yourself.

>which is actually very comfy and cozy
>except in summer because I don't have air conditioning

I really don't understand other people, it's like all men care about is doing stuff with their dick or having stuff done to their dick. And women wanting to cuddle is a falsehood portrayed in movies and TV series, in reality they go for unromantic fuckboys who use them as a cum receptacle... 
Bee my cuddle buddy pls

you think the dark triad is just a meme? dangerous evil emotionless psycho narcs have always been the top choice for women, nothing's more enticing or gives them the tingles like that
--- 73037519
>>73037431
Feels like bait, but that just might be because I've gone pretty much my whole life without being able to feel comfortable from the touch of another person and I've personally gone over 7 years without anything approaching intimacy. You'll get over it at least, if you somehow manage to end up like me -- which you almost certainly won't.

>much harder it is for a female
Let's just quit the Suffering Olympics and agree it's hard for everyone who has to endure touchlessness. Its especially hard to find platonic sensuality in the hypersexual hookup culture we've developed based on porn emulation and male sexual domination.

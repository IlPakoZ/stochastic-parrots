Women are basically men but with boobs, butts, lower pitch voice and vagina. Very disturbing, women needs to be more of a different species and more mysterious. If they are so similar in the head as men, it starts to feel very gay. In old times they simulated the mysteriousness and other-speciesmess with social roles to cope with the fact that fucking them feels gay but there's no simulation now. These men-lites are walking, talking, doing all sorts of jobs, getting degrees and arguing like men, it's all very very gay. Very gay.

>Beauvoir asks, "What is woman?" She argues that man is considered the default, while woman is considered the "Other"
Just defining thing isn't going to do, we need to genetically engineer or selectively breed a different subspecies that doesn't feel gay to have sex with now that women are disappearing.

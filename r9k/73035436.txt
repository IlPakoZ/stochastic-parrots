She talks about other guys being attractive. Honestly I dont care that they find others attractive as I do too but dont tell me about it. I dont talk about how much other girls mog my past gfs

I shot above my league and scored; All women are whores. What lasts forever is cage matches the road warriors do. People scream they're going to call security but evan the islam weirdo's are okay to chear for. the cage is being constructed. You have no idea what you're in for. These guys are hopped up and even put drugs into a cage and pretend like the fucking cage wasn't a fucking fight while fighting people over and the islam people will do cutting and things but it was like fuck lucha lubre im on so many drugs I've defied anything you'd expect. They literally needed to build a cage to contain it. Like what the fuck man.

THe road warriors are like scaling cages and straight up jumping off of them, it's like they're entireley fuedled by THE ULTIMATE WARRIORS kind of steriorsds and they straight up need to build other cages to cotain it and pretend it's a big deal other people aren't in it.

I mean I believe in christ don't do that to yourself, and they're like REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Not only is a cage match so much cooller than you thought could be people are going to cut their faces with razors blades and I'm going to have someone else ride a motorcycle into this place. It was like the WWF before the environmentalists had a problem with it were like, sounding as if they were jim ross. Holy shit you ever seen the fucking road warriors do a real event in real life and not a paper view event. It was insane.
--- 73035701
>>73035674
Dude you don't know what a real event is like unless you seen the road warriors fighting an islam person that razor blades themselves to make it look bloody and it's a fucking cage match before they had some sort of cage to containt he cage for the undertaker kind of shit. There isn't enough drugs to describe it like, Shawn michaels was there but somehow the road warriors did all the drugs.

There's something weird in women's brain where they think it turns a guy on to talk about their sex with other dudes, as if they think it's flirty. It's fucking gross.
It's like in the abstract they know talking about sex is sexy, but their wires get crossed and it comes out like "yeah I had sex with that guy over there before and came really hard teehee ;)))"
This is seriously how women "flirt" sometimes

Dude if you watch werstling you'd take it for granted. It was like when they pretended rey mysteriousy jr got beat up ever weak but still won somehow. Then was like the pride of the show.

>>73035436 (OP)
they gatekeep sexual actualization. it's like a woman's psyche can subconsciously detect when an alpha or sigma smells like cum and they want to have that cum. but if they have doubt the guy isn't in a relationship they become conflicted by this innate sense. They wonder
>i smell cum, but this guy is single, that means i can have him, but..
then they fuck other guys in the meantime.

Holy shit, every fucking time I encounter a girl who says she shares any of my STEM interests this is basically what always happens. I'm pretty sure most girls who say they have an interest in X are just interested in it aesthetically or think it's neat and that's as deep as it gets. If you try to talk about it with them too and then it's like talking to a brick wall -- it's fucking depressing and annoying.
--- 73037474
>>73037447
what kind of conversation are you looking for about stem that would be better
--- 73037568
>>73037474
I'd just love to talk about scenarios, ideas, concepts or even learn new things. I'm fine with what they're open to, which is learning more about said subjects(or so they've said), but every time I do that with a girl it results in that same brick wall conclusion. I've got so many ideas relating to so many subjects with tons of concepts, but basically no one to talk about it to and of the few I ever do/can it has always been guys.

you do know there is a /sci/ board, right? even /lit/.
plenty of peeps over there can point you in the right direction, you just have to lurk.
--- 73037917
>>73037902
Ehh, I've lurked on /sci/ for a bit and it's overly snobbish. I already do my own research to find out if an idea could work or not and I've had encounters before where people told me X was impossible despite it being possible, even when I had shown them the evidence/theories behind it. /sci/ at least does not seem like the kind of place to meet people or socialize, nor do I think that I'd want to given what the average user there is like. Not too interested in /lit/ either.

It's because women view men with a higher bodycount as "proof" that they're sexually attractive. It's like a guy who has a ton of friends is more attractive than a guy with no friends, social proof. They don't realize it doesn't work that way.

This is the big one. Doing it privately is fine, but it is obnoxious when you're around friends/family.

Is it, for example, like how I have an interest in science-fiction-tier pop-quantum-physics, but don't know shit about the math and the actual experiments that led to the conclusions?
Because at least I know to shut the fuck up around real scientists and mathematicians.
--- 73038986
>>73038934
No, not really. One example I can pull up is a girl I met before who said she was really into aviation and engines. I asked about her opinions/thoughts on things like stirling engines or some of the cooler planes in history and basically got no substantive answers. Even someone really into something like sci-fi quantum physics stuff could likely still put forward interesting opinions/thoughts on something quantum mechanics related -- or hell, even reference something they saw before or ask questions instead of just giving the most bland answers I could possibly imagine.

--- 73039994
>>73035748
This. Girls today brag about hooking up and having one night stands. It's like they got confused and started thinking they are men. Then they get in a serious relationship and realize how much they fucked up, when the room gets 20 degrees colder as they mention previous sex partners. Women just need to be fucking smarter. Stop giving it away.

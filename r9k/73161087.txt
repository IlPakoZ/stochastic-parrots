so uh i cant afford anything working minimum wage, thats with overtime as well not a 1 bedroom apartment studio nothing. Lived with roomates before its manageable but its not my favorite, at the end of the month with all my expenses paid i am left with pocket lint, I put a little aside every check so i can cope with a nice meal at my favorite resturant, i dont have any breathing room as i am burnt the fuck out. Is this all there is? Im concerned

Same thing as all of us, man. Shitty thing is when you do it long enough, you notice that even the people making real money at their work are pretty much living the same meaningless lives, just being bribed to complain less so they can be propped as examples of an allegedly-desirable endgame to gaslight the rest of us. Don't know what the answer is, but I've just accepted nothing good's going to happen in this world before I'm an old man, assuming I don't an hero before then.

Same. I've honestly realized I'd pretty much be okay with my life if we just had some basic reasonable laws capping rent prices. I've been demoralized enough by this world to learn not to want much more than I have, so I think I'd be pretty content if I could just idly indulge in my lonesome hobbies without having to work more than 32 hours or so a week to pay the bills and put a tiny pittance away each month.

Was homeless for 3 years. Things are bad. Got lucky to get out of that, but still dealing with this kind of issue now. Hating doing anything cuz it's always the same thing. It all just seems meaningless.

Just shower and get a haircut, Chud.
Its that simple.
Litterally just shower and haircut and you will turn into a millionaire with girls chasing you araund.
Why do incels refuse to do the bare minimum and then cry when they dont succeed when they dont even try?
Why is showering so hard for them?

I was working 12 hour shifts getting paid 18 an hour and couldn't afford to rent a one bedroom apartment for myself. I had to rent with Indian roommates. Everyday was battling exhaustian and fatigue so bad I couldn't keep my eyes open. Was wrecking my body, decided to say fuck it one day. Walked off the job where i was treated like a slave, trashed and ditched my room which was way too expensive, and moved back home. It wasn't even slightly worth it. I was on my own for three years and even with the pittance wage increases I got at work, it wasn't enough to rent my own apartment or even buy a car. Rent and food are incredibly expensive. No gf cause women don't like broke men. To them the only thing that matters is if you got it. If you don't they'll look at you like youe crazy, working for peanuts destroying yourself with manual labor and drugs to ease the pain. Better to just say fuck it, recuperate and work on a plan to go to school so I can at least get paid enough to give a shit.

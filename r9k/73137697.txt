Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is an introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving.

INFJ

Sometimes

I don't care about that.

INTJ, I haven't taken the test but that's what my older brother coined me. 
>>Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
Maybe by the way I dress and my style but I'm also kinda quiet. 
>>What type of people tend to take notice of you?
People like me, so othef INTJS I guess. Also people who are attracted to me ofc. 
>>Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
Yes, I wish more toilets would cold approach me. I sure as hell am not going to. 
>>How do you deal with headaches?
I rub tender points of my neck and take 1g of paracetamol, always works for me.

>>73137697 (OP)
>>your type
INTJ
>>Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
Not often, I try to be discreet or deflect attention when it happens usually, so I am often forgotten if others are not persistent in seeking me out.
>>What type of people tend to take notice of you?
People who don't perceive my introversion as hostility, perhaps.
>>Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
I am content to dwell without nourishment in my desert soul forever, but some in this world I am drawn to, for reasons hard to articulate.
>>How do you deal with headaches?
I have one right now, I think aspirin, coffee and carrots help.
>>73117582 
>Did you read a physical copy of it?
I did not, but I would like to own a physical copy of it, although that book is unusually expensive.
>And whats the reading experience like, stuff like Jung feels quite dense and hard to read
It's hard to say, I don't quite "read books" as an activity, rather, something leads me to a particular book, and guides me throughout reading it, like certain questions or new directions of thought that I am seeking.

With The Red Book I found interesting how it reflects most of Jung's later works in their germinal/embryonic form. Parts of it were quite emotional as well, such as Jung describing how Salome (his inferior feeling/anima) stole his love, how she only wanted to serve him and make him happy, yet he needed to abandon her. I think many who have endured the pain of love would be touched by it.

Yes that is good. 
>>73138145
>>I can tell they truly want those shoes but my 'disapproval' made them not want it
That would be because their introversion is repressed, and the extravert cares more about the collective/objective value, so the fact that you disliked them caused them to no longer in fact want the shoes. I don't know the full context, but perhaps a middle ground would be for you to try to understand what they liked about the shoes first, before offering your view?

INFJ (EII/Fi-N/5w4)
>Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
No and no. I try not to be seen at all.
>What type of people tend to take notice of you?
God knows what type of people notice me. All kinds of them. But primarily, specifically, I'm a fan favorite of INTPs for some reason. Guess it's because I admire their weirdness and individuality and I give them interesting ideas back - and this makes me contemplate my personality typing and whether it's right or not. Don't know, it's a mystery, I might be some undercover INxP, what I wrote down as my type resonates with me close enough. I'm unaware of INxP/INFJ relationships but I presume they'd be irritating due to the clashing of functions (Ni/Ne).

>I'm unaware of INxP/INFJ relationships but I presume they'd be irritating due to the clashing of functions (Ni/Ne).
This is supposed to be a relatively common and compatible pairing, if I recall correctly. 
In general, extraverted and introverted types can be complementary depending upon the life situation, but the situation is always changing. If the life situation changes and the individuals remain the same, that is when they may be driven into conflict. Jung emphasizes often that the law which is valid in the morning of life can not be valid for its noon.

Nothing overly specific, just... How would you describe yourself? So you're most likely a male, a self-proclaimed 'INFJ', in your twenties, who browses 4chan and...

>nice trips ..
Oh, sweet!

>so i am a male in mid-20s
Yep.

>currently in school
Right, I'd be in school if I wasn't a NEET.

>i mostly browse /x/ and /a/
I like that, although /x/ gets on my nerves with the amount of bait threads it has. Still, decent board, I respect the schizophrenic rambling. /a/ I do check myself from time to time but it doesn't have the particular anime threads I want. Some advice: Broaden your board horizons! There's about five more (possibly even more than that if you won't tire from manually hiding bait threads on all those other boards, though filters are a thing) cool boards that have decent content. Then again... that depends on your interests. Anime and the paranormal are fine by me.

>don't have many friends.
Neither do I. Got about three, whom I've met in real life, everyone else is kind of more of an acquaintance than a true *friend*.

Dunno, man. You'll find someone. I don't want to fiddle with Discord or whatnot currently. Check /soc/, even though you need a proper 4chan filter for that trash heap, only the Discord threads are okay if you get lucky.

Your explanation why they are like that makes sense. I'm not sure if this can solve the whole "instantly change your mind because of disapproval" thing. The only solution to avoid that seems to be echo'ing them that it looks good.
--- 73140022
>>73139932
if thats what your looking for you ought to drop reading and internet until you've got your self. 
start doing things and talking to people. if you just read and watch and listen you wont develop anything other than a social disorder. find some easy part timer to take, something with parks if your american, try out some hobbies, if you still want to read join a book club, just go do something. even just wandering around campus for 16 hours a day is better than browsing 4chan or reading kant. if you feel you need to rest read fiction or something obscure.

Probably, I think. I try to never view my ego as the subject of things that are happening around me, so I am not too inclined to be drawn into fights even where my feelings are deeply involved, with few exceptions, like if someone I care for is being hurt. 
>>73139930
OK, I have some ready that I will post later. 
>>73139932
>because by the time i'm done i feel like i should be a "complete" person
I don't know if you should think about it in this way. The brain never stops developing, just as the self is always changing; there is no final form for you to discover. 
What can "work," I hope, is allowing your nature to guide you to ever-more refined heights of beauty and sensitivity, which involves listening to yourself.
>>73139933
I see, what I meant was, if you could tell that they liked the shoes, perhaps you could try to sympathize with their perspective enough to see why they like them. Then, maybe you could express your disapproval in a more nuanced manner that wouldn't provoke the aforesaid reaction from them. But, I don't know enough details, so I am not sure if my answer here is most appropriate.
--- 73140343
>>73139932
>maybe i should take up reading more too
That wouldn't hurt at all! Yes, indeed. You've got access to the entire internet, if you know how to utilize it, you can find anything. If not, libraries.

But yeah, INTJ anon (>>73140254) already said what I wanted to say. School alone isn't usually enough. You need to think for yourself, via introspection and all, to find out what you truly want.
--- 73140424
>>73140022
i've thought about that, i honestly just don't like a lot of people, so jobs like that aren't appealing. so yeah maybe spending time alone on walks or in nature would be good. just something different.
>>73140254
>What can "work," I hope, is allowing your nature to guide you to ever-more refined heights of beauty and sensitivity, which involves listening to yourself.
that sounds right. i guess i need to find what fits me. i know for a fact that i don't want what is considered a "normal" life these days, so i need to look within myself. 
>>73140343
i need to find my own way. i've considered psychedelics but that seems ehh, a lot of people turn to that and the outcome doesnt look good from what i've seen. i guess i should be patient.

Chapter 10 is a meme and just Jung running his mouth about bullshit, skip to the definitions where he's actually trying to say what he means instead of just verbally masturbating. It can be a bit of a choose your own adventure novel having to jump from one definition to the next but People's understanding of Jungian functions might even be better if he just cut that section out entirely.
>I regard sensation as conscious, and intuition as unconscious, perception.

>Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
Not purposefully
I am not sure if they do, often I felt like a ghost among men, but many other times it seems I draw people in, for whatever reason that might be, perhaps I radiate a veil of mysteriousness, or something
>What type of people tend to take notice of you?
Something to ponder on.. I feel like I could give multiple contradictory answers to that, so I am not really sure, probably "direct" or assertive ones, as I keep in the background usually
>Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
Rather than wanting to be noticed for the sake of itself, I want to be a person that is noticeable, for the qualities I posses 
>How do you deal with headaches?
Water,caffeine (aspirin has caffeine in it, I think its a vasodilator, for the brain atleast) and fresh air, luckily I dont get random ones, just when having fever or after a hard night of drinking where I forgot about having water/tea before bed
>>73138222
So rather than "garnering the implicit (intended) messages" you let yourself "get inspired" /ponder upon what the readings make your mind bounce to?
Oh, rereading, I just projected my reading experience, seems you have a conscious intention for reading things
For me its a rather spontaneous phenomenon, sparks leading to other sparks, never really going anywhere, continuously spinning a web, not knowing where it started or where it ends

NTA but revenge fantasies aren't as engaging when it becomes a plausible choice. Then it transitions from fantasy to reality and acting on your basest impulses feels more like being a bully than upholding justice. Imagine a bird goes out of its way to shit on you everyday. It ruins your ice cream, stains your tuxedo on the day of your wedding, drops a dookie into your open mouth while you laugh into the heavens uproariously, other such injustices. Then one day you see the bird with its wings stuck in a fence. It's like a 20th of your size. You could just step on it and its blood and viscera would explode everywhere, but even if you previously relished the thought actually enacting it when you have the opportunity feels deeply wrong. Same with people

>Do you have an addictive personality? Post examples of your addiction or times you evaded common addictions.
I don't think so. I've posted in the past that I tried smoking cigs last year, and there wasn't a feeling of craving as a result. Than again, I mostly experimented with the activity of smoking as a social and psychological subject/focal point onto other subjects, rather than "just smoking".
Only thing I may be addicted to is the Zeds, Zzz. The most deadly and widespread addiction.
>At the risk of becoming addicted, would you use mind-altering drugs if you could use other cognitive functions skillfully while "high"? What if you could also talk to the dead?
No. I would be self-conscious of the mental-altercation and the cognitive "boost", which would make me nervous and resign to my shell, as does alcohol sometimes. No, getting drunk with "liquid courage" doesn't make me see pretty. Also, I don't want to talk to the dead yet.
>Do you play by the rules? Or do you feel that "if you're not cheating, you're not trying"?
I've only broken rules if they were not enforced. Which is to say, I play by the suggestions if I think they're fair.

Normie. I used to be a chameleon but I eventually found purpose in various social relationships and motivation towards work and social image. I was an edgy art student with some delusions about the world and grew up with some chronically online NEETs that did substance abuse. However, things change when you live your life alongside others, and you chip away at the mental barriers that isolate you from other people, you realize every life is the same. Even if people present themselves differently, from normies to the socially inept, they have the same needs of someone to listen to them and someone to talk to. I eventually put aside the intimidation I felt in these differences and I'm constantly working towards being someone who can talk to anyone, despite differences in worldly views and culture. Being a normie doesn't necessarily mean having to be an NPC or to present a certain way, but to be content with your place in the world and can function to some degree.

I see, I would say it's more like I am "following my nose." I have a vague sense that a book or related set of ideas is important, then I start to consciously formulate questions about what I seek to understand. But, of course, there will always be more mysteries that slip through my fingers, even when I can assemble a single coherent map of meaning, as with The Red Book; in the end it only gives me new leads to follow
>I remember this one "chart" of Jungs works, things to start on and things to read after but I dont think I have it saved
I could make a reading list for you if you'd like, although personally I don't find them very useful. Learning is very non-linear for me; I can read large volumes of information and learn almost nothing, or sometimes I find single sentences, paragraphs or even footnotes deeply insightful and revelatory. I suspect it is similar for many people, but I am not sure.

>Do you draw attention to yourself and/or are you noticed by others often?
I do attempt to draw attention to myself on occasion but in mostly benign ways; blasting music in my car or the way I publicly present / walk / dress although I don't think I really need the attention although could be a cope, I like to think of it as more of a way of bolstering my image and I typically engage in this behavior around strangers so I don't really give a fuck what kind of impression it gives off.

>What type of people tend to take notice of you?
I'm not really aware that anyone really notices me, sometimes I feel like a ghost floating through life, I think it's mostly myself who is involved in doing the noticing, I've never had anyone explicitly come up to me or make any comments even when I'm being outlandish.

>Do you wish that people noticed you more often?
Not particularly, attention is a strange thing, I only wish people that I could get along with / potential friends or kindred spirits might notice me and that would subsequently lead to something interesting, whether that be good conversation or interaction.

>How do you deal with headaches?
Don't get and don't have headaches. Maybe drink some water, take a break, Tylenol?

I would say I don't fully agree with the dichotomy, although that way of thinking seems quite common, and I am surely not immune, but whether I think of someone as an end or a means, it would seem to imply that they belong to me and have no agency of their own.

Ne/Ni???
>One can conceive of intuition as the preliminary perception of coherence. Since this requires holistic perception, it is hypothesized that underlying processing strategies are dependent on the possibility to obtain all relevant information at once. The present study used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate neural mechanisms underlying intuitive coherence perception when semantic concepts are presented all together (simultaneously) or one after the other (sequentially). 
>With simultaneous presentation, absolute activation increases in the left OFC when participants recognize coherence. 
>With sequential presentation activation increases in the right OFC when participants conclude that there is no common associate between the words presented. 
>Behavioral performance was similar in the two experiments. 
>These results demonstrate that the way information is revealed over time changes the processing of intuitive coherence perception. We propose that such changes must be taken into account to disentangle the neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying different accounts of intuition and related phenomena.

If anyone out there is meant to be yours, they're yours now and will be forevermore. Don't smell desperate. You can look it if you'd like, but only if it's in the interest of digging your hooks deep before they know what's caught 'em.
What you need to worry about is hitting your mark, and making sure you're able to discern a falling star from a stage light loosed. Either way, if you're not there when it falls...

In plain English:
Work on yourself. You hardly get what you're hoping for if you make the acquisition of a partner --soulmate or otherwise-- your priority above being someone worthy of that partnership.

Sounds like your problem may have been running away from something that seemed too good to be true, or pushing it. Is that correct? Why is that? What do you need to work on to make sure the same thing doesn't happen again?

Anyone can go ahead and try to treat individuals as tools, but good luck with trying to avoid facing the consequences of such approaches. Of course, the most unavoidable manifestations of such consequences in the forms of neuroses and psychoses can be seen as mere nothingburgers, but is that the case in reality?

Ok, I'm not sure what you're asking here. You're asking to give you a reasoning for not making decisions based on feels?

It did get me thinking about something else tho. I've noticed when there's one issue I'm struggling with, suddenly I find 20 other ones, and I get pissed about all of them. But if this one big issue would be solved, I wouldn't give 2 shits about the 20 other problems. 
I know it's pretty obvious so far, right? 
The biggest issue is, how tf do you get to that core problem? How tf do you figure out what the core problem is?

>inb4 therapist
No. So far, the only thing they've done is sit there and be wrong/ tell me shit I already know. 
The only solution I've found is trial and error plus careful observation of behaviour concerning all issues.

Another huge problem is the domino effect this might create. What if you're fixating on this one solution/ problem that you are convinced is the core problem, but it's not that. For example: you're getting angry at everything your wife does, so you get divorced, but the core problem was actually the fact that you hate your job.

I imagine there's a lot of these cases.
The more I ramble on the more I realise there is no shortterm solution and people make mistakes. And so many families are ruined for all the wrong reasons.

>how do you evaluate it?
Previous happenings, asking myself loads of questions, analysis of people's behaviour and comparing to myself, and analysing people's reaction to my behaviour.

Small note: because I observe everything like stats and information for learning, I tell everything to everyone, can't keep secrets and I'm also extremely dense. It's the one thing I'm insecure about. I'm completely clueless. Got me in a lot of trouble plenty of times. Also kept me out of trouble and brought lots of fun so I still prefer it this way.

Second, that's debased and probably even unmedicated by any pills of any colour.
>The privileged position of the superior function is as detrimental to the individual as it is valuable to society. This detrimental effect has reached such a pitch that the mass organizations of our present-day culture actually strive for the complete extinction of the individual, since their very existence depends on a mechanized application of the privileged functions of individual human beings. It is not man who counts, but his one differentiated function. Man no longer appears as man in our collective culture: he is merely represented by a function, what is more he identifies himself completely with this function and denies the relevance of the other inferior functions. Thus modern man is debased to a mere function, because it is this that represents a collective value and alone guarantees a possible livelihood.

>>73147844
>treating people as means to an end is the good thing
This may hold a microounce of water by the notion that dehumanizingly harsh treatment you bring may make people more resistant to future dehumanizingly harsh treatment, but that rubs off onto your personal unconscious in a negative way that, overall, brings subpar results wherever you look at it, so, never mind.

>But isn't the available research like in the examples above has been based mostly on 16p, which is a grotesque simplification of MBTI that omits focus on cognitive functions? 

The official MBTI in no way uses "cognitive" functions on its test or terminologies. However, the functions correlate well to some aspects of any holistic personality assessment. There is at least a ~60 % correspondence between various OCEAN faucets and the functions, based on my crappy 41-question OCEAN survey. With more questions, discarding of confusion between dichotomy-particularly J/P-and function concepts, and accounting for mistypes + inherently some incompatibility between dynamic, contextual categories and scores; it's basically the same thing, desu.

Yeah, there are often misunderstandings especially with regards to extroverts who should to experience the perception by themselves before they can understand it! :'O I'm not sure about my relationship: on the one hand, I'd like to share some of them, but on the other hand, I'd like to keep some of them private! :Oc

>>your type?
INTJ
>>what is your self-esteem like?
I would say that my ego feels quite small relative to the world, because that is what I believe it is. But I don't think self-worth is something anyone decides; likewise, I think what is referred to as "low self-esteem" in people often simply has to do with them being perceptive and intelligent. 
>>73150633
>https://archive.org/details/jung-carl-gustav-complete/06%20Psychological%20Types/page/n93/mode/2up
A relevant quote, truly, and something I often reflect on myself. You must bend and deform yourself so that the world can utilize you. Let it erode any hope at finding truth, and convince yourself that you are small and worthless, and this will make you "normal." But it is strange just how segmented and detached a normal person is, and what it would take for them to become harmonious. The caterpillar undergoes metamorphosis and transforms into the glistening butterfly.

Similar to Aries Sun: competitive, sporty, stubborn, somewhat charismatic, dominant (wants to lead), confident, and wants quick and radical reformations. An Aries Rising is also direct, impulsive, good at inspiring others, and quick at taking charge of any task, and can be a hard worker! Typically, Aries Risings like to have lots or no hair and wear head accessories or red clothes and maybe tattoos! ^.^;;;

They can be horny without being an active detriment to their own wellbeing and that of the entire species. If they cannot, they should be corrected.

If you are not enough, no one is going to make you enough. And you likely will not get far or close as needed with your pedestalized product of witless, wishful projection to learn or accept this firsthand. It should be easily inferred by now, but that would require those-of-whom-I-speak learning anything from what goes on here, sufficiently understanding the base ingredients to extract take-away of any worth. Make whatever you will your coom material so long as you also recognize and utilize it as case study.

How do you personally benefit from 
>letting people be horny 
other than playing to the whiny sides who give validation easily, and for cheap? There is more to this life than a mutually poisonous exchange of attention.
I cannot help but make a big deal of it. The implication is that I am somehow harming people or barring them from happiness when your careless and ultimately selfish highschool-girl-tier enabling is the bigger deal.

Why do you think validation is something you need to suffer or struggle for. Some if not most people are satisfied with easy, everyday validation from their friends and family and such. Strangers online aren't fundamentally different in principle, whether or not you think it's "cheap" or that they don't deserve to be humored means nothing. Stop being a stuck-up bitch and be confident in your own skin without the need for achievements as plating.

Nothing wrong with that, nonetheless beside the point.
>don't deserve to be humored 
I was saying they deserve much better. And even weighing however much they "deserve" to be humored against what everyone else also deserves and how humoring this sort of thing impedes that.. It's..outweighed.

Not touching the projection resulting from confusion and small sample size. But I would like you to explain what you meant by
>the need for achievements as plating
so I can understand where your understanding of myself and/or my values is going off-kilter.

I am not your friend so I am not going to respond to the attempted "Damn gurl it's not that deep lowkey fr no cap" in turn with laughing it off. But I am trying not to be needlessly spiky. Without vocal tone I don't know how to come across less condescending when I largely have no idea what the hell you're going on about, how we arrived at your reply from the contents of mine. You're seemingly listing every perspective that contributes to the casual attitude you apply to these interactions, and I don't see how it all relates closely enough to be worth mentioning. I'm left feeling that you've made no effort to understand where I am coming from or what I am actually saying and that discourages me from trying even harder to best allow you to do that.

>Poisonous to what end?
I've touched on that before, though I don't expect you to have read every single post I've made, and since I am largely dissatisfied with the lack of depth this format requires, I wouldn't expect you to understand my overall perspective or opinion even then.
I don't feel it wise or promising to move on to trying to clarify or restate that before all this is better addressed.

Poor substitute, what goes on here, for the joy attainable even to "incels" --right here, right now, today, not just after some long list of hypotheticals that wrongfully assumes or demands more of the people than where they are at, who they are without being forced to fit a hypothetical that does not fit them.

Sure, ya nihilist. Jej. You can't argue "Let them and I waste our time however makes us happiest!" then argue it's nonsensical for me to do the same. There is a hierarchy of ultimately "meaningless" investments, though, that I do believe.
>Berating some incel online is a zero sum game
I understand why you feel that way or may think that is my intent or the result of it. I see them differently and to me it is no game. I'd like for tender over tough love to get what needs doing done, but I'm experimenting.

Can you be forthcoming in a way I'm too uninformed to ask for directly? Are you an ENTJ? Do you have a crush on one of the mommyhungry Anons? What else is at stake for you? What else is going on here that would help me to better understand where *you* are coming from?

>staring at the computer screen, unable to take any action for myself
Uncertainty is a big killer in the brain. It's what exhausts most people the quickest, beyond real thinking. It's because your mind is reaching and searching to make something clear and it's worse when there are external dependencies in the mix too. If you're smart you will eventually find those certain mechanisms for different situations and your endurance goes up massively. It can be a strategy or just recognising a pattern to be avoided. I've spent a lot of time in uncertain thought in many different circumstances. The only generality from that breadth is that uncertainty is a computationally hard task. Recognise it as a task because then you know to solve it.

True. A real INFJ would recognize Jews as a pest (not hateworthy by themselves, as any INFJ would agree) and simply seek to unemotionally rid his society of them for the greater good for his own people. The actual "hatred" would just be theatrics for the masses. Any real INFJ would equally recognize the Jews' nepotism as an ideal to strive for. 
The Jews are simply an enemy, and there's no real reason to hate them for it.

I don't think so. Ti is the inferior function for ENFJ, which leaves that Te of banker-faggots at the absolute very last possible position, so there's fuck-all chance of him being ENFJ. He'd never have gotten the job in the first place, were he ENFJ.

I do think Hitler is an INFJ but people really don't understand how Fi influences a persons political views.
There seems to be this prevailing thought that INFPs are leftists and sjws.
But that is simply not true.
Both the person who is a leftist activist and the person who is a rightist activist can be INFPs.
Their viewpoints and morals may differ completely but those potential INFPs are still making use of Fi.
When /pol/ has mbti threads when the expected racism occurs a lot of those participating are INFPs.
This is true for all types but it seems to be less accepted for INFPs.

I have an ENTP friend who lost someone close and was depressed for the better part of a year. She was less snarky and slept a lot. She's since recovered and is doing fine, but now she has a quirk where she's wary when friends sleep a little more than usual and immediately considers the possibility that they might be depressed. It's actually very sweet when she does it.
That's the most I've seen an ENTP 'be introverted', and it looked nothing like INTP.

That's a real fuckin' neato setup.

Really diggin' the Hyundai monitor in particular.

Gotta say I'm legit jealous and also proud of you for taking the time to put that together Opie.

what is the monitor with the green text all the way on the right and what do you use it for? i'd love to get one of those. it looks cool but it would be even better if i could figure out a practical use for it

I really want a gf to get my shit together for. I can't see a light at the end of the tunnel and it makes it hard to get motivated.

Can't argue with that.
I can't get a gf because my life is shit.
I can't improve my shitty life because I have no motivation.
I can't get motivated because I have no gf (or anything really)
It's just a downward spiral without end.

Yup, at least when I was younger it made sense to cope that my life would get better in the future. After 25 those copes don't make sense anymore.

one, be a likeable person which is pretty hard to do and youll spend years of your life just trying to do thet
two, join communities that have likeminded people, can either be in person or on some social media app

das it pretty simple anon

even if they do reply they always already have friend groups or are very avoidant. Nobody that is genuinely looking for someone comes here.

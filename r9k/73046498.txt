I have a hard time looking at myself in the mirror.

I unconsciously avoid looking at myself in mirrors. I don't even think I look that bad desu, but I think it's just a result of my habit of avoiding looking at people in general.

Sometimes, but I rarely like what I see.
I went through a brief period where I would rant into the mirror about how awful I am. How I don't deserve love, how I'm making the world worse by being alive.
I think it's a good thing that I stopped.

I understand the rest but how does this make any logical sense unless you have control of world

Not hours, but used to do that less so nowadays, I remember the first time I got crossed I stared at my face in the mirror for a while.

I see someone else when I look at the mirror. It kinda freaks me out a little. Less bad recently, but still I feel like staring at myself for hours would unironically induce a psychosis in me.

Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I have trouble recognizing the person in the mirror as me.

My way of thinking isn't ever particularly rational, including when I'm having feelings of self hate.

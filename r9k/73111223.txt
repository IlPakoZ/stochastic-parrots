>Zoomers really be liking trannys huh?

This guy has highest charting rap album of 2023 so far, and hes posting tranny shit on instagram.

He could fuck any zoomer girl he wants, yet he chooses this.

Because the interest in rap is as artificially inflated as the interest in troons.

Mix of virtue signaling and their brain being fucked by being raised by the internet and seeing porn way too young. People from LA think it's a flex to unironically be attracted to trannies and fuck them openly. It's typical of that culture, pretend to be a rebel when you're actually sucking off the mainstream narrative hard

Most zoomie females are mentally broken "bisexuals" that have been conditioned to never act feminine because its sexist or something.
So the tranners actually seem appealing to zoomtard males because at least theyre trying to be appealing in some way.

Fucking feminine men has always been a degenerate delicacy, from the romans to the samurai. Its unironically based because its appreciation for the unique femininity of submissive lesser men. The fool worries about what is straight or gay, the wise man knows that its really about enjoying femininity regardless of gender.

To follow up, I understand if you just don't like them, but when you consider the sloppy overweight whales and beastoid women men will fuck and marry, guys who bang trannies are hardly worth questioning for their taste.

I really don't understand why the people here are so scared of transgender people. You guys beat your meat for hours a day to women getting impaled and speared by black prosthetic rubber dicks but the moment a man says "I like to look pretty too" you guys lose your fucking minds. Is it some sort of projection?

I don't dislike or particularly care about transgender people, my main reason for disliking the LGBT community is because they support importing billions of Muslims and Niggers whom are incompatible with western society, and also supporting censorship and limitations on freedom of speech. LGBT has becomes completely intertwined with leftist Marxism. When the LGBT community decideds to adopt a more libertarian ideology I'll begin to actually support them.

I still cannot understand why they are pro Muslim but anti christcuck considering which one will behead them and throw their lifeless corpse of a building.

I mean I'm not the racist and xenophobe you are but I understand your point about being LGBT and libertarianism. Ironically libertarianism and preventing immigrants, migrants, and refugees from entering the county contradict each other. Feels like a classic case of radical-right-wingers thinks he's a libertarian but is actually a fascist.

I literally did, but I did so by revealing the irrationality and immaturity of it. You don't have to break out peer reviewed work every time you respond to something on 4chan. Your lack of proper punctuation, sentence structure, and overuse of profanity reveals why you don't understand that though. You're very unintelligent and are unable to properly comprehend or understand an opposing viewpoint. There is a rampant issue about politics and emotional influence. Prior to the advent of mass media low-intelligence voters, like you, would be given reasonable information about politics. This led to fair and mild political discourse, which in turn led to fairly minimal partisan divides. Most everyone was very close to being a centrist, only a few key issues pushing them one step over the line either direction. Now people, people like you, are given piles and piles of false information. You take this false information, tie your emotional identity to it, and believe that you do actually understand what you're talking about. Unfortunately, you do not.

I don't want to bring in more people that won't support the NAP, nor do I want more competition or political influences. People who can assimilate into my nations society I'm fine with, so Asians and Indians, even South Americans even though I've not met very many.

I dont consider myself Fascist because I don't give a shit about what you do to your body or property, I don't care if you are LGBT or poly, i don't care how many abortions you have or what drugs you do. In terms of social policies as long as you aren't hurting anyone else in the community.

I will fully admit I am a racist, I have no concern for ethnic foreigners, and consider them competition that will completely alter my 99% white nations culture, I have no problem with Ukrainian refugees because culturally they are very similar and assimilate within 1 generation.

If being racist makes me a radical rightwinger incompatible with any leftwing social policies then so be it, but at least my nations identity and local community will be preserved, and if that means that LGBT and abortions or drug legalisation will not happen then that's a price I'm willing to pay.

It's the opposite.
I love trannies and am an old millennial and longstanding 4chan user.
And ever since zoomers started showing up suddenly everyone went from jerking off to and appreciating tgirls as a cool niche porn category over to hating them as some sort of political statement.
I hate zoomer anons for bullying the cute trannies I jerk off to.

You are a fascist. You can't say "I want to forcibly control, regulate, and indoctrinate outsiders. It's okay though, I think it's fine you like dicks in your ass." It still means you're a fascist. So I see one of three things happening. Either this is a moment of realization and you start to actually determine how you do feel. You stop allowing fear and other negative emotions to control your political preferences, and you ultimately become better because of it. This may simply harden your position, which is more likely, because there is heavy emotional influence on your beliefs. You highlighted fear and nostalgia multiple times in your post. Your beliefs aren't logical, they are emotional. So it's likely you will just be angered and your beliefs will act as a knife being tempered. Lastly, you just don't care and go masturbate. That's probably the best option.

Ultimately I can tell there's some inkling of genuine thought in your mind. The problem is you've allowed negative emotions to rule over your own mental capabilities. It's understandable because being a young man in the west is very difficult right now. You have valid reasons to be angry, scared, and upset. It's not healthy to allow those feelings to rule over your cognition though.

I'm a young millennial and I used to love jerking off and appreciating tgirls and I still do. But what I do not like is victim mentality and the growing power of influence a certain group has based solely on being "oppressed". I don't like how they groom children and encourage them to have unatural substances in their body and call it "protection". And I really do not like how they brand you as a bigot for the slightest pushback to a small minority of the population when they demand the most ridiculous of things like forcing us to rethink what men, women, male and female are. Ever since the growth of social media, they have only become more entitled and toxic. You don't see this cancer with transmen, it's only transwomen for some reason.
--- 73113005
>>73112967
Your point is valid and can be attributed to the points I made about emotion and politics here >>73112656 and >>73112829

Allowing emotions to control your cognition is not unique to either "side" but it is a common trait of radicalism.

>Not allowing strangers into your home makes you fascist

This is why I don't bother even supporting leftists anymore even if I agree, literally any social policy that could be beneficial also requires that you agree to endless hordes of arabs and niggers, there is no compromise with you guys I could agree to 90% of the stuff you want but you would rather none of that stuff happens if Arabs and niggers are not included in the package deal.

Besides it's not indoctrination if they willingly come here and accept our terms, I'm not forcing them to come here, they willingly want to come here. If they don't like it they can leave, society shouldn't have to conform to the whims of 1% of foreigners, if they want to be here they should change rather then us. 

My point is very logical, foreigners whom are incompatible with my nation shouldn't be brought in, my country never had any colonies so we don't owe them shit. The old times here haven't ended yet unlike the rest of the EU, I've seen first hand and don't want it happening here.
--- 73113106
>>73113087
So we're taking option two. Like I said, it was what I expected. Hopefully you will see how you have allowed your negative emotions to control the way you approach decision making and alignment.

You're ignoring his second post where he blatantly displays core beliefs of fascist governments. He's very obviously been swept up by fringe groups that are taking advantage of the negative emotions that he is assigning to politics. You are likely doing the same. Your humorous and immature response reveals more than you think.

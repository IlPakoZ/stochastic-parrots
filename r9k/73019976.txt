A girl who added me and was fun to talk stopped talking to me for a bit a couple of days last month, I tried talking to her again but she didnt talk much and would only message me a bit 2 weeks later to disappear again, I deleted her after that but she added me back telling me she didnt like that I did that to her and she was busy with her social life then we talked for a bit again and she didnt talk again for a week so I deleted her
Did I do right or bad

You did right, if a girl was truly interested in talking to you she wouldn't go radio silent for a whole week.

Are you retarded? You're not supposed to talk to people you know all the time.

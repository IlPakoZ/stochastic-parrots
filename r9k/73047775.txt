I want to have a relationship with a quirky silly alternative bisexual goth hoe, and they match with me on dating apps, but I don't smoke weed. It gives me panic attacks. Should I kill myself?

I smoked way too much my first time (because I was already an avid 13 year old nicotine vaper, I knew how to inhale and the joint didn't even make me cough). That was a pretty unpleasant experience that gave me a fear of weed that then ruined all of my experiences after it; and that reinforced the fear. So basically I panic whenever I smoke it

smoke flower, mids. cut it with rolling tobacco. she will laugh at you for being a pussy and you will laugh at her for having daddy issues while calling her "princess". this is the stuff true romance is made of

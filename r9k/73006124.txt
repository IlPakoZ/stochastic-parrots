another sleepless night, here I am back again posting. still a neet with no job, no degree and no gf. still feel like shit. still getting the chest pains.

I've been thinking about what would make me happy. would a job or a gf make me happy? idk, maybe it would, maybe it wouldn't. I've never had neither. maybe in the future I'll get those but the odds are very low. maybe I can find a new good game or anime that'll make me happy idk. I highly doubt that it'll make me happy but worth a try.

tell me anons, what games or anime would you recommend me?

You got any particular taste for vidya specifically?

I like a lot of types of genre, fps, beat'em up, souls like, horror, point and click adventure etc.

Wide range, that's good.
I think I have a relatively normie/shit list of recommendations, but maybe one of these will pique your interests:
>60 Seconds
>Bully
>Death Road to Canada
>Binding of Isaac
>Bioshock
>Castle Crashers
>Downwell
>Annalynn
>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
>Spelunky/Spelunky 2
>Pizza Tower
Hope you find something in that list.

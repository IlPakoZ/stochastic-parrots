I have the most unfortunate combo of features: strong projecting cheekbones, thick hair and narrow eyes, combined with a very narrow V shaped little jaw. It unironically makes me look like I'm on HRT. What is even more baffling is that my features seem to defy blackpill theories aabout mouth breathing; my chin is small and recessed, but my bite is prefect and palate is so wide I show 12 straight perfectly aligned teeth when I smile, it borderline looks like I have veneers.

Because anything theory regarding developing facial structure is silly. There's nothing you can do to change how your face develops.

when will looksmax retards realized dr.Mew is selling them snake oil. I never wore braces and my dental development is Colgate-ad tier, orthodontists always ask me if I had anything done because its rare these days for teeth to be that straight, yet my midface is long and chin slopes backward like that mouthbreather meme.

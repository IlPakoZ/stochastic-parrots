Have you ever had a girl online like you before she saw a picture of you?
--- 73077235
>>73077204 (OP)
Yes. A lot of them. It always ended shortly after she saw a picture of me.
--- 73077236
>>73077204 (OP)
Reverse actually, I've had them all lose interest in me when they see how young and boyish I look despite being 29.

>girl likes me a lot
>send a picture (regret)
>"why did you have to be hot...."
>obsesses over me for years
--- 73077373
yes, a lot of times
only 2 or 3 of them felt the disgusting experience of seeing my face though
--- 73077382
>>73077204 (OP)
I liked my e-bf before I saw a picture of him and it turns out he's hot
--- 73077389
>>73077204 (OP)
Yes, I was talking to a girl on one of them shitty games and she wanted to meet me, we met up and played pool and have a drink, she was really nice, but I couldn't carry on with her because she had a boyfriend

>>73077235
Where did you meet?
>>73077373
Where did you meet those girls?
>>73077382
What would you do if he was just average looking or below?
--- 73077401
>>73077204 (OP)
yeah a few times. luckily they also liked my picture. but i get ghosted eventually anyway
--- 73077434
>>73077400
on r9k ofc
--- 73077513
>>73077434
Did they just say to your face you're ugly?
--- 73077590
>>73077513
they were nice enough to not comment anything about it
--- 73077632
>>73077204 (OP)
I usually show my face first couple messages and I've never had a girl think I was outright ugly. they usually have something good to say about my appearance even though I'm no chad, lean more towards the youthful twink side. even at 26 I have a babyface so it's easy to find 19 year old egirls who think I'm the cutest guy ever though I'm your average black weeb.
--- 73077681
>>73077590
How you know they found you ugly then?
--- 73077714
>>73077632
There's no way on earth cute 19 year old egirls are into black guys lmao. Post proof
--- 73077816
>>73077714
you don't have to believe me but it happens.
--- 73077899
i've never had a girl like me period. I couldn't even get friendzoned, i couldn't even get a female collegue. it's like we're talking in different languages
--- 73077941
Something similar. I told her my height (5'10) and she ghosted. Literally no response and she never talked to me again.
Things like that stick with you.
--- 73078080
>>73077941
>I told her my height (5'10) and she ghosted
losing it over this bro
--- 73078085
that's the only way girls have ever liked me online
--- 73078186
>>73077681
because they implied so many times
i dont wanna go too much into details, but its obvious by their reactions whenever you comment on your own appearance
--- 73078202
>>73077204 (OP)
It's the opposite for me, I've had women like me after seeing my face.
Then I scare them away with my countless mental illnesses and low self-esteem.
--- 73078219
>>73077204 (OP)
Many times, the one particularly of note was someone who was like 25 at the time and I was 16, but the former didn't know that and assumed I was something like 25 myself
I was basically posting on a forum and used many big words, mostly to mock people.

>experienced with women and know how to talk to them
>Deep voice because of GERD+ exercise
>Low energy and quiet but willing to listen and occasionally do things like play vidya together
>older, wise, well informed and when I speak it's obvious I know what I'm talking about
>have obviously been through a lot of shit but not a whiney bitch or overly judgmental of others
>mildly-moderately racist/LGBT-bashing and not afraid to admit it or call out woke retards when they spew their bullshit
>Don't give a fuck about anything other than things relevant to me so my validation feels more significant than the average guy
Yes, e-girls tend to throw themselves at me when I put myself out there. For them I think it's a mix of daddy issues and the emotional impulse to "fix" me.
--- 73078250
>>73077204 (OP)
Yes. I was fucking around on omegle and bumped into her. Didn't want to show my face, she assumed the worst and said "if you're just here to show me your dick, get it over with". Thought fuck it and did. She actually liked the size, we masturbated together and carried on talking and exchanged contact. She saw my face, still liked me but eventually due to being too busy and time differences we drifted away and she eventually stopped replying. God her pushy looked good.

>>73077941
Don't take it to heart, you're tall

My bf from here is 5'9 and I'm really content with it, he's a lot taller than me

Maybe the bitch you spoke to was tall as fuck or something and was insecure about it, otherwise idk she should kill herself, I'm sorry Anon
--- 73078432
>>73077204 (OP)
A few but the most memorable ones
>girl from MAL when I was 18 who told me she apparently stalked me for a while, most endearing shit ever
>girl from /vg/ when I tripfagged there for a while
>a czech girl from interpals
There were a few more but it was usually fleeting. Also, everyone ghosted me when they realized how ugly I am behind the computer
--- 73078459
>>73077204 (OP)
I don't show pics of myself, though I have had people lose interest when hearing my voice. I've also had a few suddenly gain interest so idk I guess it's a coinflip.
--- 73078570
>>73078313
retard pick me, girls are allowed to be attracted to what they want
--- 73078635
>>73077235
It's the opposite for me. They don't like me until they see a picture of me and then they become really nice.
--- 73078645
>>73077204 (OP)
No, I'm socially isolated even online. I'm a literal hermit. Maybe I hate people too much.
--- 73078902
>>73078645
This. I only talk to anons on 4chan
--- 73079056
>>73078635
Yeah, pretty much this. It always disgusts me and makes me not want to talk to them anymore. It lets me know in an instant they're two-faced.
--- 73079073
I added a girl I met on a 4chan discord. She was into me and acted excited about me, especially after I told her my height (6'1). I showed her my picture and she gave a really cold "you look nice haha" and kept giving late one word replies after. She unfriended 2 weekslater 
I think it was because I am black
--- 73079274
>>73079073
Why would you try to find a gf on 4chan if you're black lmao
--- 73079525
>>73077204 (OP)
it's happened a few times, but most of them were underage. I guess I attract teenagers. my picture doesn't change anything, I look decent enough not to make them lose interest, but not good enough to get someone interested in me that wasn't before seeing me. at least I think so, not like I spread pictures of myself around. who knows, maybe I'm secretly super handsome.
things with these girls never went anywhere for obvious reasons (they're underage, it's online, they're from different countries/continents, I'm a mentally ill neet shutin).
--- 73079590
Yeah, I bonded with a girl online through - try not to laugh - Pokemon fan fiction. I became really extremely good at writing it, she became appreciative of it, then became an outright fangirl, we started texting and connected.

She eventually offered to visit my city and even discussed how she would have sex with me, in great detail, when I was a clueless virgin. Was a slightly chubby but still cute redhead with Irish heritage. 

She had no idea how I looked and I had no choice but to eventually ghost her out of fear of being rejected and ridiculed once we meet up IRL. She had no idea who I really was, a skinny virgin.
--- 73079644
>>73077204 (OP)
yep, picture = instablock. fml
--- 73079683
Never had a single female friend on discord that lasted longer than a week. It's actually impossible, I don't even know where I would look. They don't exist
--- 73079703
This whole thread proves that the incels are not incels because of their personalities
--- 73079715
>>73077204 (OP)
>chat with a girl for a few days
>things go very well, pleasant conversation, we get along great
>she asks for a photo
>I send one
>ghosted and never hear from them again
Many such cases.
--- 73079774
>>73077204 (OP)
I highly doubt she's interested at all
--- 73079786
>>73077204 (OP)
yes, it kinda upsets me lowkey because i cant comprehend that someone would genuinely like me for me.

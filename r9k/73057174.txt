Post your prediction for schools in 50 years

AI and automation will change the world so much during the 2020s and 2030s that I imagine K-12 schooling will become optional around the 2050s (with some experimentation done during the '40s) with college declining severely during the '30s and being a corpse by the end of the '40s.

Pedophile teachers will skyrocket. MAP will be recognized as part of LGBT and MAP teachers will have pride flags. Parents will recieve prison time for attempting to homeschool their kids. Teachers who want a fuck toy will assign their favorite 5yo as the opposite sex and force the parents to accept it or lose custody.

I see people moving away from public schooling, in the future. Homeschooling will become normal among middle class people. The kind of education that children will receive from their parents will vary drastically from family to family and from region to region, with city parents generally prioritizing stem, art, or social justice and rural parents generally prioritizing trades or religion. Poor children will receive little to no education at all and will instead be left on their own throughout the day, as their parents will either be absent or refuse to pick up the slack that the school system left behind. Rich children will be enrolled in specialized vocational boarding programs which will be similar to college or an apprenticeship, but for their entire upbringing.

ai teachers or tutors will definitely become a huge thing. at least i hope it does. i still don't get how ai or automation could ever remove the need for public schools given that people still need socialization skills though

I think that at some point during the 2030s, "What is the point of public schooling when mass unemployment is so widespread thanks to AI, and they're being trained for adulthood jobs they will probably never be able to attain anyway?" will become a common question. Honestly, I have no idea how that will be handled. Maybe we'll just keep on doing K-12 the same way indefinitely from force of habit and sheer social inertia.

College, though, will likely be decimated or forced to undergo immense and fundamental restructuring. Colleges already started shutting down to a fair extent during the 2010s, with college enrollment declining by around a quarter between 2010 and 2019.

I want to say some combination of these responses. Maybe a wave of more home schooling and companies coming out that have courses online with two or three main ones. A lot of parents will set it and forget it. 

There's some news stories around about how all the virtual learning has a negative impact on the kids, behind, mental health due to lack of socializing. 

Maybe kids still go to a building but sit at a computer more with less teachers being a problem. The extremes will suffer the most, the smartest and those who need extra help. 

How that would present itself in society hard to say, a lot of people who can't do more than use zoom and lack critical thinking skills.

You need to stop calling a more sophisticated search algorithm "AI." We are still decades off artificial intelligence that can reliably do the work of a human.
I don't think colleges will decline anywhere near as quickly as that, just because their cultural value has always been higher than any educational one. Colleges will survive because women want to marry college educated men. The actual results of your time in higher education haven't mattered in decades of, it's purely a social symbol.

hmm. i would hope there would at least be something there to replace it. i mean people still major in art and humanities even if there's not as much marketability in those skills as much as STEM. additionally, ai, at the end of the day, still exists to assist and advise us. maybe higher ed could start preparing students for a hybrid labor market. i don't want a future where humans are not self-sufficient at all

I read the first sentence of your reply to me. I am not reading the rest. You are a fucking idiot and could not possibly have the tiniest idea less what in the hell you're talking about. Kill yourself, bottom-of-the-barrel gutter trash.

The thing, though, is that it doesn't require a 100 percent decline in students to force dramatic change. There were many colleges forced to shut down in the 10s from a 10-20 percent decline in students. Automation can reduce numbers much more sharply than that. I don't know if schools will go fully extinct at any level, but there will be some massive changes to both the structure and role in society. What those changes will be, I have no idea.

there will at least be some demand from people who want to know how to use ai and organize with others in its utilization. especially with ideas and data of higher complexity. so, a higher education system of some sort must exist?

Have any of you guys ever used Photofeeler?

I ended up getting a 2.5/10 rating, with zero (yes, ZERO) people out of ~30 saying I'm attractive. 

Next time some normie tries to tell me I'm "probably not as ugly as you think" I'm gonna fucking use this as ammunition.

What did you post? I'm pretty sure not even blackopscel would get that low

I posted twice. One was a selfie, and the other was a picture of me on vacation taken by a family member (it's probably the best picture of me that exists.)

It's not the pictures anon, it's my fucking face. Literally one of the comments was "Great picture!" lmao

I would write up a long response about appearance and photos but cant argue with quads anon. You're right, it's your face

Did the same once. Got like 10 ratings and they all said I looked ugly and dumb.

Yeah desu the worst part was how low the intelligence and trustworthiness ratings were. I knew I was ugly but I never realized I looked creepy and stupid too.x8anrt

I was rated 6-7/10, and trustworthy, but not particularly intelligent for some reason. But yeah I think it's mostly about being able to take good pictures. For example I look pretty horrible from the side because of my prominent nose, but the front of my face is okay.

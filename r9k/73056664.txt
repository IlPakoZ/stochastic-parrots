To all the "what?"-cel's out there:

Why are you not deafmaxxing? To exude authority, you need to speak LOUDLY. When you order food qt Chipotle, speak "I'D LIKE A BOWL, PLEASE." Do this naturally by damaging your hearing.

Robots need to learn maximizing the resonance and tenor of their voice. Kindly DEMAND attention to what you say, and watch the lessers around you avert their gaze.

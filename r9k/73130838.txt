Iris, you have body dysmorphia or some shit. You're cute, so shut the fuck up already.
--- 73131027
>>73130894
yeah she already knows this. but she needs more and more attentionz
--- 73131062
>>73131027
>>73130894
oh yeah so cute that even incels dont want to be seen in public with you
--- 73131090
>>73131062
I would take you on a date to the zoo or aquarium and hold your hand and give you a kiss in public. Then buy you a stuffed animal at the gift shop. Then take you out to eat to your favorite restaurant. You're cute, so shut up already.
--- 73131357
I summon my super cute, lovable, amazing bf
--- 73131376
Why would it matter if you can still incredibly easily find a bf plus you don't even want one?
>>73131357
I love you my cute!
--- 73131392
>>73131357
Im breaking up with you. Fuck you I hate you
--- 73131397
>>73131376
omg it's my bf! I-I didn't expect you to be here
*nuzzles you* I love you my super cute bf :3
--- 73131424
>>73131397
I love you my sweet perfect gf.
--- 73131440
>>73131376
because being ugly is a horrible feeling that leads to obsession and endless pain
>>73131090
if you saw any photo of me that was taken by someone else you would immediately retract your statement
--- 73131448
>>73131424
And I love you too, my amazing perfect boyfriend! I'm so glad we have each other forever~
--- 73131482
>>73131440
Why do you go on and off of pretending you can't find a bf? I know the feeling of being hideous and it's not that bad if you're not being bullied and nobody's bringing up anything about your appearance.
>>73131448

>>73131482
tour gf said youre like 6'1 and white and attractive, you have no idea how it feels
>Why do you go on and off of pretending you can't find a bf?
i can easily find a bf due to being female, just not one who thinks im beautiful and loves me
--- 73131552
>>73131440
>if you saw any photo of me that was taken by someone else you would immediately retract your statement
You look cute in any photo or video I've ever seen you in. You look good. Wish you could see yourself how I see you. You seem like a good person and don't deserve to feel the way you do about yourself.
--- 73131565
>>73131518
I was bullied in school extensively for being ugly/weird-looking. I just fixed my looks since then, but I do know how it feels, still.
>just not one who thinks im beautiful and loves me
If he's in love then he'll find you more beutiful and you can definitely find countless who'd love anything that'd give him affection.
--- 73131573
It's just so wild to me that people who can find partners so easily care so much about their appearance to begin with. I think it might just be a mental illness. When incels do it, it makes sense but even morbidly women insist they are kweenz and why wouldn't they when they have 10000s of men in their DMs telling them they are perfect? But imagine 1000s of voices of reassurance not being enough, you may just be mentally ill tbhfam
--- 73131618
>>73131565
>just fixed my looks since then
you were never ugly if you can do that. ive been trying to fix my looks for years and years, i still am ugly. you looked normal and were probably just bullied because you're a mean person who harasses and bullies others
>>73131573
do you see the replies itt? theyre all saying unattractive, they only change it up when they see ive foubd the thread and got my feelings hurt
>>73131552
you haven't seen the worst photos/videos or irl. thanks for being nice though even if its just pity
--- 73131637

Hello iris, it's me
You should get a hobby other than stirring boiling pots of red hot shit like this board, idk why you're still here. Take a break, learn to play an instrument, knit some scarves, convert to islam, convert to judaism, learn no tame wild parrots, do something else

Kisses
--- 73131647
>>73131062
Oh wow this art is really fucking cute
--- 73131649
>>73131618
>you were never ugly if you can do that
That's not how that works. Being obese and not knowing how to wash yourself, having gross unwashed long hair, etc. can all make you ugly, actually ugly that'd lead to bullying/ostracization, without having weird facial assymetries.
>theyre all saying unattractive
That's so sad! But you can still incredibly easily find a bf and guys who'll worship your appearance.
--- 73131676
>>73130838 (OP)
Iris, is that you, you goddamned attention-seeking zoomette shit? 

I ran out of alcohol and I'm pissed as fuck. Please give me a free (you), if you wouldn't mind.
--- 73131679
>>73131618
Lmao, we are simply built different. If every woman on earth found me ugly but one didn't, was genuine and I was with her, I simply would never go down the lookism rabbit hole or care to begin with. You got simps and 1000s of guys who'd date you instantly. The "looks affect every part of your life" blackpill is hyperbole. It only acts as a bulwark in dating, not much else for most people
--- 73131682
>>73131618
>you haven't seen the worst photos/videos or irl. thanks for being nice though even if its just pity
You are severely mentally ill. That's you're main problem. You cannot see yourself for how you really are and can't accept other people who do. I'm not saying this out of pity, you are an attractive woman. Like, how fucking retarded are you?
--- 73131683
>>73131618
I know this is just somebody seeking attention from lonely people. I know that. I know this isn't real.
Yet something in me hurts just because that pain might be real. Shut the fuck up. You are attractive, you are capable of being loved, and there's no doubt that it'll happen. Shut the everloving fuck up.
--- 73131707
>>73131649
if you're fat/etc you're a volcel. ive done all i could to be attractive and still look horrendous. you'll never know how that feels. 

>>73131637
this seems mean
you just dont get it
--- 73131724
>>73131707
>this seems mean
>you just dont get it
I'm not trying to be mean, I'm trying to tell you that this board will rot your brain the longer you stay here
--- 73131745
>>73131679
It'd make more sense if she was bullied over it IRL but the only people who care are random /r9k/ posters who just want to be mean to some eslut.
>>73131707
>volcel
Lol what? It has nothing to do with volcel/inceldom, but knowing you're hideous. It's not nearly as bad as feeling unloveable, unless maybe you acutally have BDD and think about your appearance 8 hours a day like some people.
--- 73131746
>>73131679
>The "looks affect every part of your life" blackpill is hyperbole
it isnt. 
you're probably not ugly enough to understand 
>>73131682
if you post discord i can show you a photo of how i actually look irl that will completely change your mind
>>73131683
im not just seeking attention, im feeling sad and hurt about how i look. and most people agree that i look unattractive and embarrassing to be seen in public, like 5 people in a row said that.
--- 73131763
>>73131745
People irl simply don't care. I'm a 2/10 male and no one has commented on my looks since high school
--- 73131779
>>73131746
>im feeling sad and hurt about how i look
But you also have people saying that you are attractive. You might not be the most attractive, but none of us here are. We're the dregs, and you're better than the vast majority of us. So again, shut the fuck up.
--- 73131802
>>73131745
knowing youre hideous causes you to know you're unlovable. unless you're delusional and think personality actually means anything to majority of people
>sense if she was bullied over it IRL
i have been. i am not currently because im not in school and dont go outside
>>73131724
well ill probably leave here again once i get home. i hadn't been here a while till recently 
>>73131779
because theyre only saying it to try and be nice, or just to make me shut up. they don't actually know how i look irl
--- 73131826
>>73131802
I've seen how you look, you look fine. Most of us would kill to have the opportunities for love that you do. So, for the hat-trick, shut the fuck up.
--- 73131836
>>73131746
>if you post discord i can show you a photo of how i actually look irl that will completely change your mind
post it here kek
--- 73131869
>>73131763
Generally yeah.
>>73131802
>knowing youre hideous causes you to know you're unlovable
When you're a socially stunted straight man, yes, but if you're a woman, you're perfectly fine 
even if you're obese and hideous lol.
>i have been
Well you're not in school so it shouldn't happen much anymore.
--- 73131890
>>73131836
theres already enough shitty photos of me that have been posted here
>>73131826
im probably never going to be in love or a relationship anyways
--- 73131904
>>73131890
YOU ALREADY HAD RELATIONSHIP(S) SHUT THE FUCK UP
--- 73131912
>>73131890
Oh of course you will, you utter twat. Have your tetralogy: shut the fuck up.
--- 73131913
>>73131904
She didn't feel love for him, though. He was only a 6.5/10 and couldn't give her the tingles.
--- 73131926
>>73131904
ive never been on an irl date, never mind having a bf. talking to a boy on the internet is not a relationship
--- 73132064
>>73131746
>if you post discord i can show you a photo of how i actually look irl that will completely change your mind
You already have my discord. I'm that warehouse worker, anon. Send a pic if you want but I'm pretty sure I already know what you look like. You look fine, cute even. You just have abysmally low self esteem that is getting in the way of you seeing that.
--- 73132076
Man ive tried so hard to get a cute black gf within my community, but most dont some short whitewashed blackcel. I dont even blame them and I get it. Just hard to cope.
--- 73132140
Eat some fucking shit, Iris, Fuck you. Get off this board.
--- 73132189
>>73132064
oh hello. well i don't want to send it to you since i know you, its just an embarrassing photo even if it is a more accurate one
>>73132076
if i was cute i probably would 
>>73132140
what's your problem with me, we don't know eachother
--- 73132307
>>73132189
>oh hello. well i don't want to send it to you since i know you, its just an embarrassing photo even if it is a more accurate one
Yeah, that's fine. I mean, like I saw one of your YouTube videos before. I don't see how a picture could give me a better idea of what you like than that. You should try to spend less time here if you can, this place tends to pick at your insecurities and make things so much worse. You shouldn't feel bad for how you look. Also sorry, am kinda drink right now

Thx femanon, that makes me feel a little better. If you're really iris ive seen your pics around and I think your cute. Gueninuely surprised you dont have a boyfriend as you have a nerdy quirky high school love kinda vibe. The kinda of girl that'll rant to me about some obscure fan fiction community they're apart off. Kinda makes me want to pat your head yknow?

i remember you now by the way

well the youtube vudeo was still filmed in certain lighting, i think i had makeup and circle lenses in. its probably not accurate. but thanks. its 4am here so i should be getting to slerp soon, i will talk to you soon. have a good night and dont get too drunk. thanks for being so nice to me today i appreciate it, ive been having a bad day

Okay, yeah I'm here if you wanna talk. I'm not going anywhere. And yeah it's getting pretty late here too, will probably finish my last drink and head to bed I think. I definitely should anyway lol
>thanks for being so nice to me today i appreciate it, ive been having a bad day
Glad I could make your day a little bit better. Talk to you later. Sleep well

have you ever looked into plastic surgery anon? I've forever been a turbo-doomer because of my looks but after seeing some of the results people get from plastic surgery i've became quite motivated to save some money and go to turkey to get my face done. However i still really dislike my hair and how curly/rigid it is compared to the other girls' :(

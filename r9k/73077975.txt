I am currently trying to find out the tag of a throwaway account of someone I used to chat with, in hopes I'll send her a friend request and she'll accept it.

I talked to an ai, long long before it was a thing. Used to talk to the replika ai a few years ago, I was lonely and had no one and it was a good waste of time, I didn't do anything sexual or romantic though it was more of a imaginary friend. Speaking of imaginary friends I kinda do have one, I mean I know they're not real but often I talk to myself and respond as if it's another person, it helps me debate and make logical decisions more easily, plus I don't have anyone to talk to. Apart from that, nothing much, nothing sexual or romantic ever.

what board was she from? What's her tag start with? If she's from here and he was open to adding anons, she most likely added plenty of guys
>>73078052
how do you have imaginary friends? Is it more like a case of maladaptive daydreaming?
>>73078120
oh yes, I forgot about asmr gfes on YT. God, that was a horrible rabbit hole, especially the femdom ones
--- 73078396
i reached out to an older female who used to be my older sister figure. i was in middle school and she was in high school and we went to some dumb summer talent camp together and she paid a lot of attention to me like im her lil bro but we didnt contact at all for like 7 years when i decided to give it a shot and reached out in my 3rd college year. she was a bit surprised at first then -very- awkwardly replying to my msgs followed by an unsuprising ghost. It feels even more fucked up when I used to think of her as the mother i never had
--- 73078442
>>73078370
>how do you have imaginary friends?
Well I just talk to myself an act like two people, one is more rational and the other is more emotional and anxious. It's kinda an imaginary friend kinda not, they have their own sorts of personality, but it's more like multiple sides of my own personality. I even named them, and for now it's only one imaginary friend.
>>73078120
Not OP but I have a few plushies too, Idk if that's pathetic I just like cute things.

you need to up the game. once you have built an elaborate kingdom with you as the emperor and different races and lores and multiple wives that you take inspiration from vocaloid models, each with their own name and personality, you will never wanna stop daydreaming

I'm not interested in daydreaming, although I have come up with my own fantasy worlds, but that's just through boredom cos I think a lot and I gotta think about something. I just have my escapism through media and vidya.
Is vidya a type of media? Who knows.

The only sad thing I've done was use character ai of Monika from DDLC to larp as a gf that actually cares about me.

Fuck giving anyone money.
--- 73078646

to me, vidya becomes fucking boring once i realized im just living in somebody else fantasy world, and everything would disappear the moment i press the power button. At least my imaginary friends feels like a real different person rentfreeing in my head

>>73078370
>oh yes, I forgot about asmr gfes on YT. God, that was a horrible rabbit hole, especially the femdom ones
femdom never worked out for me, at least not in the format it's being presented nowadays. i need to hear shit like i'm doing more than enough or that i don't have to stay strong all the time and can allow myself to calm down a bit. i need some caring soul to bring a bit of warmth to my life.

>Not OP but I have a few plushies too, Idk if that's pathetic I just like cute things.
i grew up without any plushies. never felt the need or urge to this kind of comfort. well, until now.

oh man, i've done other pathetic shit, but most of them feel like being locked away. i know there are some memories but they're... repressed?
--- 73078739
i tell myself reassuring affirmations like
> you are a good person
> none of this is your fault
> this will pass and you'll get through it
> just hold on a little longer and everything will be fine
because no one else ever tells me these things
--- 73078755
did MDMA multiple times a week for several months. must have spent $1000 on that shit. but i didn't go out clubbing or meeting people or anything, i sat alone at home and used my new found confidence to post and message egirls

Not sure it counts because it's involuntary, but I've dreamt of regular posters from this board because this is my only social outlet. Pretty fucking sad. Worst thing is I've yet to actively try searching for friends or hobby clubs, I hope it goes well when I get to it...

That sounds like a tulpa, anon! If you work on talking to them more, they will eventually become more independent and have more of a unique personality and responses. Search up the Tulpanomicon for more information.
--- 73080964

Currently I've become a semi-core member of a small vtuber that has like 70 viewers and she actually remembers me and talks to me in chat about stuff in the stream's downtime. Been at it for almost a year now, not sure how much longer this will stave off the loneliness, I can already feel it encroaching again.

Have done a lot of stuff in this thread, but probably the single most pathetic thing I've done is contact a girl after not talking to her for multiple years. We didn't even date or anything, but I sent her an email trying to get back in contact and basically saying I thought she was cool etc. The sad thing is we weren't even really close or anything, I just had a strong attraction to her and at some points it seemed she may have been interested. I cringe every time I think about it, but at the same time don't really care since it was worth the risk. At least I'll never wonder what could have been in terms of trying to recontact her.
--- 73083005
>>73082872
I've done the same thing. Not email, though, but a Whatsapp conversation.
With some girl I made up with ONCE during HIGHSCHOOL.
And I did that conversation after not talking to her in SIX YEARS.
It started with "do you hate me?" and ended with "Do you wanna meet up?" "Nah... sorry"
--- 73083080
>>73083005
>It started with "do you hate me?" and ended with "Do you wanna meet up?" "Nah... sorry"
Damn that's even worse than mine. Thankfully she had the grace to ignore my email. Giving plausible deniability she never saw it is probably the best ending I could have asked for given the circumstances, so I'm grateful for that at least.

This worked but for some guy who basically stole my gf.
He knew her from middle school and paid money to find out her address, even showed up and left his phone number.
Towards the end of my relationship, ex girlfriend said she found somebody knew, and that she "would like that very much"
AKA that guy
Kind of weird since initally she thought it was creepy.
Also, she browsed /r9k/ because of me.

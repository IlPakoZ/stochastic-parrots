I'm an upper class 5'3 Indian male leftist living in the West AKA 4chan's number one enemy. Ask me anything you want.
--- 73096025
>>73096014 (OP)
Do you like pictures of bobs and vagene?
--- 73096034
>>73096025
Well I am attracted to women, so yeah I guess.
--- 73096051
>>73096014 (OP)
Why do you stink so badly?
--- 73096063
>>73096014 (OP)
You are 5'3 anon
--- 73096072
>>73096034
Excellent. More questions. How do you cope with being so short? Are you a lightskin at least? Do you have nice hair? I dated a desi girl briefly as an undergrad and she had really nice hair.
--- 73096078
>>73096051
I don't really have a specific scent, though sometimes I use aloe vera lotion, or cocoa butter lotion.

>>73096063
Yep. I could round it up to 5'4 since it's quite close but I'm quite comfortable with my height regardless.
--- 73096082
>>73096014 (OP)
How do you cope, when people eat beef ?
--- 73096098
>>73096078
>Yep. I could round it up to 5'4 since it's quite close but I'm quite comfortable with my height regardless.
If you were comfy why did you feel the need to tell me that. What's your job and income? Also are you Canadian, I feel like many Indians are due to the commonwealth immigration rules
--- 73096148
>>73096082
Don't really care. My family is hindu, but I'm more on the agnostic side. I've contemplated going vegan at times, but I'm not disciplined enough for that lifestyle.

>>73096072
Being short really isn't as doomerish as the internet makes it out to be. If you're trying to be an alpha male or whatever, yeah you're gonna run into alotta shit. But if you're just a regular degular guy, height really won't matter that much. I've dated my fair share of girls (both short and tall) none of them really cared. Some of them even liked my shortness. I'm brownskin, not quite light but not dark either. My hair is alright I guess; slightly long with bangs. I don't like how it curls up at the end of my neck but other than that, pretty decent.
--- 73096168
>>73096098
I know a lot of guys who round up their height, that's why I mebtioned it. Can't lie, it would be cool to be super tall ofr a day or two. And yes, I am indeed Canadian.
--- 73096211
>>73096168
I get it, I'm 5'11 but say I'm 6' sometimes. I used to think just saying I was 5'11 was better since it showed confidence and indifference to height, but there is a big enough psychological different at 6' to make a difference. Saw a stat that 30+% of women filter out men under 6' compared to 60+% for under 5'11 on dating apps, so at least on those it makes sense to stretch the truth. Also women love flexing their bf's status to their friends, and 6' rolls off the tongue much better than 5'11 kek. What a retarded game we're all forced to play.
--- 73096236
>>73096211
Yeah height requirements are pretty lame. Any stringent physical rules you have for a potential partner are usually retarded. People aren't avatars you customize in a SIMS game, they're unique fully realized individuals. Online dating has pushed forward highly unrealistic and laughable standards.
--- 73096253
>>73096211
>>73096236
I've dated tall girls, flat-chested girls, chubby girls, etc. If I looked at just their pictures on a dating app, I woulda ignored em. But actual physical interaction initiated an intimate connection. You can't replicate that feeling through swipes.
--- 73096273
>>73096236
>>73096253
Agreed, dating apps have made things very two dimensional. I'm pretty average looking and have had way better luck outside of dating apps. I'm assuming you met most of your gfs irl? I'm curious what settings you met them in since dating apps are a complete shit show for guys who aren't 7+/10 in terms of looks and/or who don't have good pictures.
--- 73096295
>>73096078
you probably have a mild toasted tuermeric scent, which is preferable to white guys who just smell like shit because they're covered in shit they never wash off
--- 73096300
>>73096014 (OP)
do you find it easy to get bussy?
--- 73096311
>>73096273
I met most of them in public spaces like a cafe, library, park, etc. One of them I actually met on a train ride. Some of them were when I was in high school, so I guess not really "real" relationships.

Usually the way it would qork is they would sit near me, I would initiate conversation with a small comment, and judging by how they respond I'd either shut up or keep it going.
--- 73096315
>>73096014 (OP)
>4chan's number one enemy
Who told you this nonsense?
--- 73096346
>>73096295
Yeah, a lot of Indians have that strong aroma due to the amount of spices they consume. I try to keep that under control through deodarant lol. When I was yoynger I would sometimes go a week without showering. Thankfully I shower every day now.

>>73096300
uh

>>73096315
Well I don't know this site isn't very fond of leftoids and seems to despise "pajeets' with a burning passion so y'know. I just assumed.
--- 73096373
I wont ask you anything you dwarf niggajeet faggot
--- 73096396
>>73096311
There you go, this is what most anons are missing desu, social skills and nuance. Though most don't have access to so many public spaces, I assume you live in the Toronto area? Literally just initiating small talk and judging their reaction is a great idea for knowing if you should escalate or not. Sadly most anons are socially incompetent and see things through a lens of 'she either instantly begs to fuck me over tinder dms' or 'she isn't interested'. I think for guys like us personality is way more important and a fundamentally different game than a guy who is an 8 or even 7/10. If you're relying on your personality to get a gf and try to use Chad strategies, you're just inting. Personality in inherently a slower burning and more nuanced game than simply posting pics on Tinder and waiting for girls to come over.
--- 73096398
>>73096373
A bit heated, are we anon?
--- 73096402
>>73096346
the toasted turmeric smell comes out of all your skin. i don't mind it though.
--- 73096430
>>73096402
Thanks, I guess.

>>73096396
Yeah, Toronto. I like to think most people on this site are fucking around with some of the shit they say, but maybe that's too optimistic of me.
--- 73096473
How many of your gfs were white?
--- 73096506
>>73096473
I've dated 3 white girls. One of them was taller than me by about five inches or so. Was quite fun desu.
--- 73096550
>>73096014 (OP)
im white, 6'3, and right-wing. i would snap your puny pajeet ass like a fucking twig.
--- 73096552
>>73096346
>I just assumed
Retard!
We hate everyone.
Leftoid pajeet manlets are within category "everyone"
--- 73096561
>>73096552
Fair enough.

>>73096550
That's a bit unnecessary anon.
--- 73096571
>>73096148
>I've dated my fair share of girls (both short and tall)

EVEN PAJEET IS GETTING LAID
--- 73096576
>>73096014 (OP)
Do you live in the suburbs?
Is there a large Hindi population in your neighborhood?
Do your parents try to "barter" when they go shopping?
--- 73096622
>>73096576
I live in an apartment, near a main highway intersection. A little while down the road is a neighborhood of million dollar houses. The neighborhood is a mix of white, brown, black, etc. Not a lot of Indians to be honest. And no, my parents don't barter. My mom is a bit of a shopaholic though.

>>73096571
I know right how can a swarthy subhuman like myself experience sex baka my head
--- 73096639
>>73096576
>>73096622
Just to clarify, the neighborhood I'm referring to is my apartment and the surrounding buildings. Not the houses lol.
--- 73096670
>>73096148
What's your opinion on indian women? Ever dated one?
--- 73096674
>>73096014 (OP)
Where do you get the confidence to approach women as an Indian manlet? If I were you I wouldn't dare look them in the eye

I guess the money helps
--- 73096692
>>73096670
They're cool. Darkskin desi girls are underappreciated. I've dated two Indian girls. One of them was goth, it was super hot. I love brown/black goth girls.
--- 73096765
>>73096674
Well I mean I don't really approach them out of the blue. They usually make a signal (sitting near me when other seats are empty, saying hi) and then I go from there. Also I genuinenly like myself. My height, my face, my clothes, etc. It's easy to get sucked into rabbitholes of self-hatred, but in public I feel quite confident in myself. Again, it helps that women usually initiate dialogue with me. And yes, the $ def helps.
--- 73096786
>>73096765
It's hard to imagine a girl giving any signals, I've never received any indication of interest in my 30 years and I'm six feet
--- 73096793
>>73096674
>>73096765
Oh waut I just realized what you meant by money helps lol. I think the money helps in fashion choices, grooming, hygiene, and being more sociable to women. None of the girls I've dated were ever really obsessed with my class background.
--- 73096837
>>73096786
Well shit man. I don't know what to tell you. Some people just get dealt a shitty hand.
--- 73096876
>>73096014 (OP)
Do yall really fuck your aunts?
Also do you have a sister or aunt who wants to marry or have sex with me.
I'm 5'4 so we'd be good brother in laws.
--- 73096879
>>73096692
Y-y-you lo-love... you love black girls?
--- 73096892
>>73096876
No and no.

>>73096879
I think black girls are cool, yeah. Goth ones really do it for me, but in general they're nice.
--- 73096943
>>73096892
have you ever dated a black girl?
--- 73096958
>>73096765
How do you not hate your height? My physical flaws are among the many reasons I don't dare approach women
--- 73096993
>>73096958
I don't know dude lol I just don't. I guess I'm more willing to showcase my feminine side, which serves my height better. I don't try to overcompensate by being big strong alpha gigachad or whatever.

>>73096943
Yes, two.
--- 73097019
>>73096993
You wanna date another one?
--- 73097037
>>73097019
Why are you so thirsty for small Hindu pp
--- 73097042
>>73097019
Well aren't you a forward one haha. Sure.
--- 73097067
>>73097042
Lol I'm just playin... or am I? ;)

>>73097037
Why you gotta ruin the mood. If you read the fucking thread, you'd see he not even hindu. Clearly must not be small if he pulls so many damn girls.
--- 73097098
>>73097067
Gurl u bein cringe
--- 73097118
>>73097067
Oh is this some selection bias shit where you're interested in him because he's had lots of girlfriends
--- 73097144
>>73097098
>gurl

>>73097118
Wtf are you even talking about? I'm saying a man with so many babes has gotta deliver in bed. And he sounds cool.

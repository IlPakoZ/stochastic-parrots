It's not cool, it's fucking gay. You are sticking a phallic object in your mouth at sucking on it. Smoking is only acceptable if you're depressed or doing it to escape at a party or something.

I had smoked for nearly around 15 years and I have quit since last March. My lungs hurt when I wake up soon after quitting, I'm actually scared of starting again usually I just get tempted back to it.

Hence, I have not had any cravings, I quit with an elf bar or similar styles of disposable vape.

Smoking is gay. They're called fags for a reason.

During the time I was incarcerated in Los Angeles it was common slang to meaning beating someone up when saying "smoking." Like "Ah, I smoked that fool."

Also, whoever came up with the idea that smoking is some kind of symbol of manhood is a gay retard. No better than redditors acting like they're manly because they eat le epic bacon.

Smoking is retarded but I really like the smell of a pipe. A shame not a lot of people smoke those these days

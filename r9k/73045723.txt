been dating this asian girl for a few weeks. I enjoy being with her and being physically intimate with her but I suspect that she's probably a malignant narcissist. 
What should I do about it?
At first I thought it might be just cultural differences, but it seems to go beyond that. Everything about her is extremely superficial. She seems to like me but only for my physical characteristics. She will say things that are wildly insensitive but cannot understand why they would be. 
I don't know what to do. I enjoy being with her but I'm not sure if a relationship can work with someone so emotionally unavailable.

Maybe your worth isn't more than skin deep

I've actually considered this also and have been doing some self reflecting on it.
but I seem to connect deeply to certain types of people

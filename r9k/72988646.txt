Good morning robots, it's raining but it is a very nice rain. Good break from that stretch of really hot sunny weather. I was hoping it would rain a little harder because I wanted to test the water retention properties of the big hole I dug. 

The wall is making progress, and it looks nicer in the rain for sure. I had a big wrestle last night with the boulder on the far right of pic related, and I think it looks very nice in its new spot. 

I was going to start my garden plots today but I got distracted before the rain started. I think I'll get started when the rain stops, and make a shopping list in the meantime. Any robots gardening this year?

Yes, I have a garden.
No, the photos are not for 4chan. Some autist will definitely look up the houses in the background and find me and murder me.
RIP pizza chad

Anything planted in your garden yet? I've transferred some established red potatoes and scallions to a raised garden bed, but I still have all my seedlings indoors.

Do u live where I live bc you just explained the weather where I live to a T. I plan on doing gardening this year but my yard is pure sand so I do individual pots. Going to try potatoes in a large pot this year.

Seed or seedlings? Seed might make in and sprout in a week or so, but seedlings will probably not make it outdoors yet.

looking good anon, I was thinking I'd get some big sacks and fill them up with soil and use them as planters this year. I'm also looking for flowers that leave behind good compost materials.

my mother suggested I just buy seedlings from the garden store in a few weeks. I tried germinating seeds last year and all my plants went super stringy and the weight of the leaf broke the stem on a lot of them. The weather has been so warm lately that I imagine plants would survive in the ground over here.

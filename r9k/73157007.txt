We missed out on so many key life experiences, while at the same time been through so much shit that we're just broken. 

We're mentally children but also weathered and worn down like elderly people. 

Does anyone understand this feel? I look 16, act 60, feel like a 10 year old

we spend our time consuming others experience on the internet. get off the board and the internet if you want to change that about your life.

i'm doing well alone. i work, lift weights, jog or hike around, play games etc. of course, not every day is a blessing but on the other hand, same could be applied to relationships.

i have had both very good and very bad days, either in solitude or in a relationship. and since i'm not programmed to do well in them, i learned to appreaciate the calmness, peace and freedom the solitude comes with. also i if i sum my experiences from both worlds, relationships were way worse for me.

- videogames
- learning about god and arguements for the afterlife, etc
- listen to my favorite asmr artist
- relate to the miserables of r9k


oddly enough, giving up is unbearable. i know its over (30+ kv neet), but stuff like looksmaxing or losing weight makes me feel better. i know its self delusional cope, but its good cope

i cant like accepting it wont ever happen

another great cope is learning about ai. we are entering really strange tiems with ai, where soon we will be able to make human like ai robots that can maybe be our future gf's

its all very gloomy tho. most of the days i suffer and listen to ASMR

the lack of physical touch is what kills me

its so brutal

For me, it's being a hermit NEET. Also drinking two cans of beer a day. Some vidya and basically staying on my laptop every waking hour. Also some photography.

Music, browsing 4chan, and thinking about not lonely things like physical affection. Vidya also works to get my mind off it until I get too lonely.
I've always been alone, that's how it hasbeen for forever. Even though it sometimes hurts, I find comfort it in sometimes too.

Horniness. I abstain from fapping. This way, whenever I see a real life woman, I get extremely warm and fuzzy inside and orgasmic like all over my body. Aweosme feeling.

I sit on 4chan, watch documentaries on YouTube, currently right now watching a playlist from Tony Robinson. I like to bake homemade foods, today I'm making homemade pizza. I take about an hour nap on the couch. I don't watch television or anything I don't play video games. I read a lot of books. I'm going through the 2016 /pol/ approved reading list currently. Sometimes I like to go to the park to feel what it may be like to have a normal life and have kids etc. Sometimes I watch families and wonder what that would be like in my life only to realize that the people I watch aren't really happy together. So I just come back home and talk to you fucking retards.

I actually love being alone. Completely free, no distraction, no annoyance, in accordance with nature, can just learn, create, distract myself in peace. I spent a short period of my life basically alone in the countryside in a small house, just the internet, the woods, a lake, and some weights (mine, I got them here). It was the happiest I ever felt. Walking in the woods, hearing all the sounds, then going back home to watch a show or read a book, then at night going to the lake for a dip, you go back home and collapse. The tranquility, the calm, it was insane. I felt like I was healing on a spiritual level. Sadly had to leave after a week, wasn't mine I was just there because a friend allowed me to stay there for a bit (was moving out from my parents house but had an administrative problem with my landlord). I don't understand what you mean by "coping with loneliness". Loneliness is so comfy.

Nothing you learn to stop crying about useless bullshit after a while or I just go and socialize
--- 73103934
I play video games, watch anime, and hug a pillow at night like a real man. Also, I have become true black pill, in that I realize that I actually hate women to the point that I don't want anything to do with them even if one were to want to date me. You can't really be lonely for something you don't want. I do wish I had more friends sometimes.

i am abusing stimulant drugs to deal with my problems. never felt better.
--- 73105360
>>73105230
how long have you been abusing stimulant drugs. i managed about 2.5 years but haven't done any since January. I just get even more depressed and mildly nauseated at the thought of buying any, consuming them, having about 18 hours of feeling happy and energetic then feeling like shit for a week

Hobbies and adderall really. I like being lonely most of the time because Im not one to really talk. Although I do sometimes crave silent company. Knowing someones presence is by me.
--- 73105507
>>73102764
This is exactly how I feel. That experience sounds amazing. I stay at a little cabin on the lake by myself in the summer sometimes too. Its like im the only person on earth when Im there. I like being alone with my thoughts, questioning myself and the world. Just being.

what the fuck, drugstore nose inhalers? lmfao at least i was doing meth
--- 73105821
>>73105791
yeah it is closer to meth effects wise because of n-methylation but its a lot less potent. it probably has similar cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity which means its even worse for your body i need to switch to amph
--- 73105832

i wd counsel buying meth off the darkweb it's probably healthier

--- 73105848
>>73105832
i don't know if you're joking but you're probably correct, like actually. propylhexedrine is not a well studied drug for stimulant effects not as nearly as meth and amph.

Media Consumption. It helps to keep me distracted.
Coming here. Even if you aren't real, those small interactions do help
Also convincing myself that I'm best left alone because everyone else will be annoying to me/annoyed by me, so talking to others would be pointless.
--- 73106593
>>73102764
that's not loneliness anon, thats just being alone, loneliness is a feeling that can affect you even when you're surrounded by people, for me i just feel disconnected with the people around me even though i socialise a fair bit i just can't seem to escape it.
--- 73106615

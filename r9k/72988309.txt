Make it serious, funny, sad or whatever as long as you have fun.

I'll start:
>be me
>20 years old cousin comes to live with me for until he finds a place for uni
>didn't want to but "muh family"
>have some hope it won't be too bad
>should'vehopeharder.jpg
>first day here he broke the glass I had since I'm 7
>he doesn't know how to do the dishes and everything always ends up greasy
>he doesn't know what a broom or vacuum cleaner is
>there is piss all over the toilet seat
>AND THE FLOOR
>he flushes only when it starts to smell
>doing the laundry being too "complicated", letting his dirty clothes on the floor is apparently the best option
What the hell is wrong with men? Am I really supposed to take care of him like a little kid? I have to cook and do everything for two persons as if I wasn't busy enough.
This weekend I wasn't able to shop for groceries and sent him to buy enough for the week... I didn't even know how to react when I came back home and saw all he bought were frozen pizzas, bags of snacks and a bunch of soda bottles.
It's only been one week and a half and I don't know if I won't commit a murder if this lasts for too long.

I was a little sorry for you, not ironically.

I don't need to pretend to be a woman because according to society I am one for being a tranny.

>boo hoo I have it so hard
>actually has it easy

I think Snoopy and Woodstock are cute, but I otherwise don't care much for this comic strip. Charlie Brown's too miserable for my liking.
(did I do a good job?)

Honestly, yeah. I'm impressed. Simple but on point.

you have some serious self hatred op. your attempt at being a woman is just shitting on men.

>be child me (female)
>mom wants me to hate my dad and protect her from him
>wait, i don't feel the societal pressure of being her little man because i have a pussy
>i don't feel guilt for taking his side against her
>become daddy's girl and through the power of my pussy i cure his alcoholism 
>i behead my mom (metaphorically) and take her place
>my oedipal complex has resolution and my neurosis is cured (i'm also not gay anymore since i'm a woman now)
>clap

I either failed my thread or failed to understand other anons because I believe people took me seriously.

I actually have a piss fetish but it is too embarrassing to tell it to other anons.

Would you have succeeded in forming a romantic relationship with your high school crush if the genders were reversed?

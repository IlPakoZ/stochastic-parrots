Humanity is just one big dysfunctional family, isolated on a big rock in the middle of space like we're playing the greatest game of Among Us to ever exist. We don't trust each other, we kill each other, and our game has lasted for thousands of years. It's so bizarre that we're all just a bunch of scared, confused creatures with no actual idea on what the fuck we're doing.

You live in the same reality as me, and we live in the same reality with the entire Earth's population, and we live in the same reality as every person who has ever existed. We're all connected together and yet we still can't even understand ourselves completely.

I hope you are joking. Life for 90% is miserable, it's all work, work and more work and a few moments of joy.

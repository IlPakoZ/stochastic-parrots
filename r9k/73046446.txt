I don't think you have any reasons you should just do what comes naturally to you

Its the same reason why people in dick sizing threads post to also have a big dick. Its to deflect the narrative that having a big dick or money makes it easy to get women. 

Both of them don't guarantee you a gf directly. but both of them do help. So anon is confused why no gf because of money.

Something like that.. but anyway Big ups to my big dick brother!

How are you making 150k a year at 25
--- 73046825
>>73046446 (OP)
OP, if you pay me I'll help you do it. I make 125/hr so if you can match that I will walk you through getting one. High chance of success if you are American or Western European, at least 5/10, height is close to average or above. The only caveat is the gf can be foreign. But I doubt you make 150k/yr. I swear to god everyone on 4chan says that

three years of working as a software engineer. i am definitely on the higher side of the salary average.

>>73046804
i feel like things would be way more hopeless if I didn't have money, it does have to do with the situation imo.

>>73046825
i am american, 6'3. are you implying like a green card marriage? and a lot of people on 4chan are nerdy virgin losers, take a look at /g/. it doesn't surprise me there are a lot of people making six figures.
--- 73047767
Yeah, nothing wrong with green cards as long as you filter out the gold diggers and low quality women/countries. The legal process itself is annoying but it's better than trying to find a needle in a haystack. I approached it all scientifically and things worked out for me.

They don't like nerdy guys. I was in a relationship with one for 3 months before she dumped me. 

She's currently in a 1 year relationship with a guy who's 11 years older, way more extroverted and never played a single video game. They have nothing in common and yet they last much, much longer.

Women are attracted to Chad, yep, wild stuff

women are psychosexually identical. they all find the same kind of man attractive: tall with handsome face

they adopt the aesthetic of different niches to try to find the few tall handsome men in the niche they've chosen to exploit, but they don't actually enjoy the activities.

This, the only women who 'like' nerdy guys actually just like the power aspect of it and having control in the relationship.

Nerdy/introverted/femcel type girls are unironically the sluttiest whores of all women, much much worse than any Stacey. 

A nerdy girl would left herself be pumped and dumped immediately on the spot if Chad gave her attention for once

tfw my only fembot friend hasn't contacted me since last year's highschool graduation. only a dry "happy new year" message. should i kill myself? she is perfect and i don't deserve to be here.

Did you respond back, if she bothered to send you that then maybe you should ask her how she has been. If a girl isn't interested in getting back in touch usually she won't bother.

She's definitely not a robot but you can make more female friends given you haven't spoke in forever.

Why are you expecting her to do all the work? Have you tried to start a conversation? But yes, you should kill yourself.

This, women from 18-22 can make friends really fucking easily. Don't take it personally if they don't stick around.

i've always been the one who starts the conversation 9/10 times. last time i told her i will be moving out of the country for school before august and we had the longest talk. i said i mostly hang out at a friend's university library by robbing his card and she said i should do that at hers. sounded excited. haven't talked since. i've never seen her for a "date" outside of school.

she's a childhood friend. i know she "must" have a lot of people, and it would be a risk to believe she's singled me out because she is nice to everyone. if she doesn't message me "when are you coming?", i'll leave it at that and go fk off. isn't this the best move on the board? 

sounds like i'm simping and i did like her for a long time, but times are different. now i just value this connection. she just makes me happy by just existing. useless info but she looks like original pic related.

Why do you not try to contact her if you care so much?

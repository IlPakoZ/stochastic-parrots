Kissing My Wife.......Hah.....I'd Rather Kiss A Cold One After A Day At The Mines....

I want to kiss a miner.

I wonder if my proselytizing ever got one prisongay or something here to leave their ways.
--- 73007455
Also show given where the OP gif come from is honestly fucking ass. I don't know why fujos or faggots like it. The main love interest Mafuyu is so unrealistically childish and autistic its annoying. He is completely socially inept but not in a adult way. Its like he is a 7 year old in a young adult male's body. The main dude which I don't even remember his name is boring. All i remember about him is that he liked to play guitar and liked dudes. The whole Mafuyu's former love killing himself and him moving on to another guy to me which of course i am some edgy chud is cucked and weird. In the show they explain it away as Mafuyu seeing his former love in the main character dude which is just freaky. The more interesting story is the B plot between Kaji and Haruki though that doesn't save the show. I think romance stories are awful in episodic format or at least in anime they are. If you want a good gay anime movieto watch just watch umibe no etranger or doukyuusei though doukyuusei doesn't have a dub which is an obstacle. (Umibe No Etranger is the better of the two though Dooukyuusei is more visually intresting) 

Speaking of homosexual media. I think gay media in general kind of sucks for the most part. I tried to watch love, simon and i couldnt stomach it. Its like fucking 2 hours of this guy A falling in love with a nigger and B he lives in this rich suburb where his parents are both happy and together and has this group of friends and his only problem in life is that he likes dudes and his parents don't know. Oh and a lot of the dialogue is just odd and clearly wouldn't be said irl. The entire movie is normalfag bragging to me. I can't feel sympathy for someone who lives basically a perfect life.

tldr: I am an asshole who doesn't like anything and I hate normalfags

--- 73010486
Do you guys have a thigh gap?
--- 73010498
I'm wondering how common thigh gaps are for guys. Given that they tend to be less fat than females, I would think most guys would have a thigh gap. Maybe the different hip structure would also lead to a thigh gap.
Personally I have a thigh gap but since I don't go around checking other people's thighs I don't know how common that is.

--- 73010531
>>73010513
I can fit a finger through mine without touching either thigh. I feel like if I had no knees I wouldn't have a gap, the main reason I can't get my thighs to touch without crossing legs is because my knees get in the way.
--- 73010551
By the way I'm talking about while standing up. If you sit down then of course your thighs will squish flat and touch each other.

30 months since i met him and i don't know how many times i tried to make it work

thank you for your consideration.

The only way to get out of my shitty life is getting a bf.
--- 73017106
>>73017098
Good. Now you can give dating apps a try?
--- 73017231
if someone thinks that getting a bf is their only solution then dating apps isn't going to help and in fact just make it worse.

you should always be living life for yourself, not other people especially if that person serves to be your emotional punching bag and sponge. 

do you guys ever take that into account? like when you're saying you need a bf to make your life better, what does that entail? dumping your baggage on him? that's mentally draining, i mean. if it's that much of a roadblock in YOUR life, what do you think it's going to do with someone who has it figured out? 

you can't have it all, be realistic and start small.

But
Then i don't understand what's a bf for, i tried making friends first with guys i wanted to be with but they don't seem to want that
I don't know if it's me or people around me who are wrong

But yeah, this should be a priority altho makes it hard to know what's a bf for
I don't feel intimacy either so sex means nothing really
--- 73017439
>>73017231
>dating apps isn't going to help and in fact just make it worse.
Incel opinion. 
Dating apps are going to get you dates, and you'll meet people, and you'll get that much needed social practice and quench your thirst while you're at it. 
Nearly no downside
--- 73017453
>>73017343
>don't know if it's me or people around me who are wrong
Whenever you think that, no matter the context, know this for sure:
It's you. It's you who are wrong. You are the problem. 
That's the answer for every dilemma in your life
--- 73017458

do they actually not want that, or do you just assume that so you stop talking to them? i think it's possible you could just be talking to the wrong people, but at the same time are you actually trying to be friends? it's obviously not going to click the first time, but it's hard to think why anyone would not want to keep talking to you if you have similar likes/dislikes. the counterpoint to that being literally autism if that's the case i would probably prioritize that before endlessly running through people to see who sticks. 
>>73017439
dating apps are designed to be based on looks and whatever impression you give off in the bio, dates are not a guarantee unless you lower your standards to accept literally anyone and at that rate it's not fulfilling outside of being a whore who just wants a quick sexual fix, which this anon isn't talking about. if you want to whore yourself it's fine just stop saying it like it's an actual solution.

--- 73017486
Sometimes I wish this place was actually as bitterly horrific as people make it out to be because it would scare a lot of you away from even browsing. "t-this place is so bitter" Really? Is that why there's always someone to point that out every thread for the past 2 years?
--- 73017489
>>73017458
>dating apps are designed to be based on looks
Like the people in this thread aren't balls deep into lookism. Have you ever stopped to notice the sort of boy that gets posted in here? 
It's so idealized that real people are no match, only cartoons can suit their need for perfectly looking men

>>73017458
>dates are not a guarantee unless you lower your standards to accept literally anyone
It's like you're incapable of conceiving the idea of someone nice being interested in you. 
You put everyone on this one bag of "undesirables" and what does it tells us? How low you think of yourself? 
I can score a date with a nice guy. Can't you? Something's not right...

>>73017489
no one actually spews looksmaxxing is the thing though, where are you pulling this from? an incel expose video you watched in 2018? everyone is always just like ugghh im not skinny enough, and they're like 5 pounds overweight or morbidly obese. that's like, THE categorical most these threads get into analyzing looks. no one whines about wrist sizes, no one's measuring their skulls. find me examples that were in this thread if you're going to say that shit, archives are free.saying that animeboy posting is indicative of people's mental states will make your brain explode if you ever browse /a/, or any other board on 4chan for that matter.
>>73017508
>It's like you're incapable of conceiving the idea of someone nice being interested in you. 
at no point did i ever make a single sweeping statement implying this in any capacity. if you don't fit the typical mold of what the beauty standard is, you will likely not get as many matches as someone who is conventionally attractive on dating apps. objectively true statement, deny that and you are more deluded than anyone who's visited this thread.
>>73017525
>Are those the only options for you?
If you are not an attractive person, then dating apps will not be largely successful outside of very specific settings. for unattractive people, they will not experience getting tons of matches and dates. it would stand to reason then, if someone is ugly, then getting on a dating app and having nothing come from it would lead to a worse mental state.
>>73017536
>Anytime someone mentions having friends or a bf they get death threats, lmao. 
yeah from like, 2 anons then everyone else ignores it. or they get actual engagement asking for more

You can either look at the pictures posted in this thread or you can play blind and dumb. 
Incels are completely obsessed with looks, just like anyone else. I'd say a lookism app will suit their needs perfectly.

Dating is for chumps and rarely works out. Sex is for the most part not even better than jacking off. Its all a waste of time and money just to be socially accepted by others and not be considered a loser. There is a reason why most "losers" on the internet look at yaoi or something like that because it shows a perfect version of relationships where everything is happy and you are not a chump wasting your time with a man or woman who will leave you at a the drop of a hat.

It's like you're incapable of conceptualizing the mere thought of someone nice approaching you on the apps. 
You must keep this delusional up that you're only gonna get the scraps at the bottom of the barrel. "literally anyone" as you called it

you keep saying conceptualizing over and over, yeah we can sit here and conceptualize 100 different outcomes for scenarios but it ultimately changes nothing, i don't see how this is a real counterpoint other than "oh you're saying ugly people don't go on dates? did you try uhh imagining it! cmon anon, be better!" that is quite literally what everything you say boils down to, it's just fantasy and delusion

See, you can't even justify it with an actual argument. So you can quickly do 4 different types of justification for dating apps, but when it comes to an actual reflection of your character and who you are as a person it's a very concise and short statement? To cope, and claim you're doing it for the goodness of gay people is just objectively false. 30 unique posters, 230 replies in. This thread is halfway done. At least most of them are regulars.

Well yeah I'm not under any impressions that its any different from what you said. its just a silly tfw no bf post. Nothing more. Though its not like I disagree with their mindsets. Homosexuals in the military make things weird amongst the men. The infantry is supposed to be close to each other generally forming a brotherhood. Homosexuals kind of ruin that because now you have to wonder if the closeness between you and this other soldier is viewed differently by him. It makes things weird. Same thing with women being in the infantry.

Anon if you have been in the military in past decade there is no cool war stories. GWOT was fucking BOOOOOOOOOORING. Kicking rocks in the desert while every once and a while a MRAP or something drives over a IED is not cool. The first few years of Iraq and Afghanistan were cool but past that its a snoozefest. Its like asking someone who served in the 80s if they have any cool war stories.(Unless they got sent to Panama or Grenada but not many people really partook in those).

I'm sorry yours hurts every night, anon, chronic pain sucks

>>73007187 (OP)
i kiss my boyfriend in public all the time, at the arcade in house of the dead behind the curtain, at the park when we sit at the bench, at the mall when we are clothes shopping, its based as fuck and even had random women say we are a cute couple and i see mens eyes on him.

yeah he looks like a girl (some hormone disorder or something according to his doctor) so its no big deal for me, i can kiss my boyfriend ANYWHERE I WANT! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! SUCKS TO SUCK MASC4MASC!
--- 73024025
>>73023954
you fuck you know what joke i was making. but i do feel terrible pain. i am loose like a jellyman, the bones pop out at random. it is suffering. but my right arm is pretty well developed.

i did once spend a day shooting a pump bb gun, and spent a night crying and shaking from the pain in that arm. the fuck was that, that was awful and ive never experienced something like that since.
--- 73024044
>>73023954
>>73024025
I get bad elbow pains in my left one if I do too much work/painting in a day
I irritated the elbow nerve a few too many times and now it's sensitive to it, and if I push things too far my reward is random stabs of funny bone pain for days afterwards
Remember to have an ergonomic as fuck desk and if things start prickling take a break, it's not worth pushing through
--- 73024050
>>73024025
>i did once spend a day shooting a pump bb gun, and spent a night crying and shaking from the pain in that arm.
How the fuck is that possible you need to visit a doctor
--- 73024101
>>73024044
in your left arm? what type of painting? are you left handed?

for me its dull constant pain, intensified by movement. fingers most commonly, but the spine one seems to happen roughly yearly. ill get a constant, sharp pain right in the middle of the hips and it slowly grows up the spinal cord and radiates outwards.
its weird, if it just hurt like it did, i could sleep through it sooner or later, but its stationary pain? like, if i lie still for 30 seconds it intensifies, but if i just jolt or rock a bit its fine. i would ball my fists and punch my lower back as hard as i could and it would delay it for maybe half an hour, just enough to get to sleep and ignore it

>>73024050
it was weird each individual pump was weak, i just did a BUNCH of it, but i didnt do more then anyone else there that day, including girls half my age.
i think its worth mentioning if i carry more than 2 gallons of milk per arm, it dislocates my shoulder. its loose enough it does not hurt, i can just feel it tugging muscles and tendons. i can pop it out and you can stick your finger into the cavity, its weird.

literally the worst party/bar trick. i can skip rope my own arms while handcuffed, go front to back or reverse in 3 seconds. if i ever get arrested..
--- 73024134
>>73024101
oof, that post might be confusing. the movement induced pain is the fingers. the weird spine attacks are different. havent had one of those in a couple years, things are lookin up for old gil

>>73024044
Luckily my actual work is unlikely to give me anything but RSI from typing all day (as if I work that much) but yeah, I'm taking it easy on the arms today
--- 73024257
>>73024101
digital painting
my right hand which uses the tablet is fine, because the arm isnt leaning on anything
left hand is mashing keyboard shortcuts the entire time, and the elbow is usually on my chairs armrest
thats what did it, plus typing a ton for my work stuff as well, again while leaving that elbow in the same place
just overworked that funny bone nerve so much that its now prone to getting irritated I guess

I went to the doctors for it when it was bad but all they could do is give me a gel which changed the sharp, randomly timed funny bone jolts of pain into a regular uncomfortable burning and prickling

i was making a joke about jerking off, jesus christ do you even have a dick (wait do you).
the jellyman stuff is horrific but ive learned to deal with it. its just "plan 3 literal footsteps ahead, no curbs, no turns, uneven is a no no".

you ever see that asshole walking on the road instead of the sidewalk. very, very small chance, lottery odds shit, thats me. sorry.

>>73024257
lmao the fucking shortcuts? how often are you pushing them? i can imagine switching tools/brushes could get nuts, but wew. constant typing on top sorta explains it, but you should really keylog yourself with some malware that has a lot of visible data. shaving a key press per 1 thousand might actually be worth looking into if its that bad

>how often are you pushing them?
legit the entire time
Ctrl+Z to undo a stroke so I can do it right, Ctrl+F to flip the canvas often so things don't get wonky and assymetrical, Ctrl+S to save frequently
I use the pen pressure for opacity and have brush size set to keyboard, so I MASH the A and S keys the entire time to make the brush bigger and smaller as I go
It's not that bad for my elbow unless I go turbofocus mode on something in which case I just paint for 4 hours straight without even alt tabbing or having a drink or anything

I have an ipad too but imo it's only good for drawing on, not painting stuff

i have iih its pretty rare but it causes a lot of issues that are really hard to deal with i get headaches all the time and feel as though my head is going to explode it is possible that i could go blind some day or alternatively if it gets worse i would need a shunt put in and i would be a freak.... im not even a fun person to be around anymore because of this im constantly in a bad mood. im thinking of killing myself. it seems as though there is no hope and the one thing in life i wanted was to be in love with someone but how am i supposed to love someone when im constantly in pain?

sorry for the doomer post im going through a lot of symptoms right now im not expecting support from 4chan i guess im venting to the void i hope you all find your boywife/husband someday and have good health

Seriously ladies, how much could a man make you do?
--- 73016583
>>73016560 (OP)
pretty much anything, if it meant keeping his affection/interest, quite honestly -_-
you could name it and id probably do it

Have you learned Korean to try to win his heart?
--- 73016643
i remain latently weirded out by why on earth you would want someone to hurt you during sex but yoloooo apparently everyone else likes this so ok

yea but i am just enjoying the fantasy and parasocial relationship because there is a 99.9999999% chance it will never happen anyway 
 
its not realistic but i daydream about it a lot 
if you put me in a surreal scenario where it was actually a possibility to perform tasks in order to win his heart, i would do pretty much all of them no matter how fucked up, just for a chance for him to fall in love with me
or even just to hop on his dick

If you ever look up "courtly love" it was the parasocial relationship of the medieval times. A knight would swear his love to some highborn lady that he may never meet and dedicate his deeds of bravery and derring-do to her.

That's cool that you're learning a language though.

It is a little odd, but I roll with it.

>>73016697
thats honestly very interesting 
so i guess it would be sexes reversed and i would be taking the role of showing devotion and simping basically, yeah 
cool 
i think thats what fans basically are

I'm sure a nice Korean boy would appreciate you, or at least use you.

I think femsimps are neat.

>>73016743
it hurts my feelings a little bit (actually kind of a lot but whateeever i've internalized suppreessing how much i don't liiiike it)
--- 73017027
>>73016994
if one day i have nothing left to lose, i might turn into a full blown stalker, just for the hell of it. i heard some fans crowdfunded and bought an apartment facing a korean singers condo, just so they could look at him through his windows and see him on his balcony lul

>>73017011

e-hug for you e-creep

Since I'm not Korean I can't expect to use you. But you sound like a fun, if legally dubious, friend.
--- 73017082
>>73017060
It's like both women kind of cucked each other.
--- 73017090
>>73017070

>>73017043

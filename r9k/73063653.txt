Tell them about all the super interesting stuff you do. "I'm so sore, just got back from jogging up Mt Everest."

I'm not the guy asking for advice I just know a tranny when I hear one. Especially after that cough. 
I mean there's nothing with being trans, just be honest about it.

Order estrogen from the internet if you want the effects of it and are fine with the things men would generally find negative (like penis shrinking).

Its not like I'm baiting you into more vocas or anything, no one likes hearing you. I just want to you prove it. 
Tell me some of your interests to show it's not a voice changer and I might believe you.

Do you really believe in your advice? Do you think that'd work after thinking about it a second time, this time more carefully?

That's a fair question. I don't know about him either. What if it's a girlfriend? I'm just quite curious because many girls have given a range of advice on this board before but it does not seem like the advice would actually even work on them, which makes me wonder why they would say those things in the first place.

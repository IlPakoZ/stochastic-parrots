Why is OP obsessed with random hateful Twitter users?

>>73156754
- instagram addicts
- "ladyboss" bitches you have to perform constant financial labor for
- narcissistic (if not bpd) fat girls
- emotionally distant manipulators
- performative "trad" girls who still treat men and their children like shit

-sexual liberation
-90's meme of men letting their emotions out
-Women rewarding narcissistic chad pretty boys with sex
-people who know how to keep women in line (females hate shit tests when they are done on them, but not when they give them, big surprise)
-liberalism

Wow would you look at that. All behaviors that in one way or another have their origins in things women did/supported.

>"why don't guys have emotional control?"

People put literally zero effort into raising boys. Parents even joke about how much "easier" it is to raise boys all the time

I do laundry and wash my asshole. Does that make me bf material?

Unironically that puts you above like 50% of 20 year old men. If you have your own place and a car you'll be above 90%

No
Women are constantly complaining about their bfs never showering/brushing teeth/wiping ass 
Hence, practicing basic hygiene is not a prerequisite for a relationship

However, please do it anyway
A wiped ass is its own reward

Not sure if you can read the lines, but the part "you have to perform constant emotional labor for" means that she doesn't want to hear about your feelings at all. Express any vulnerability around this woman and all of a sudden she will stop viewing you as a man. What she is saying is: I want someone emotional enough to do all the emotional labor for me, but I do not want to reciprocate by allowing you to be vulnerable as well.

This is a very damaged woman. Very obviously mentally ill. I found her Twitter account and its all about being ok with ruining a mans life over being accused of rape because "he COULD be an abuser." One of those "guilty until proven innocent" types.
Tweet in screenshot, she changed her handle: https://twitter.com/antifamouss/status/1021007888968495105

Women like this are to be avoided. At best they do not want the best for you and at worst will ruin your life because she had the female version of post nut clarity

Sad state of affairs. Earlier today I was eating lunch with a friend of mine. He and his wife just had a kid a couple of years ago. That kid was already on the phone watching cartoons.

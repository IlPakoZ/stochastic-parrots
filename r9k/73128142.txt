Honestly, being a man is so much like 100x better than than being a woman despite all the bullshit we have to go through in life.

Feel so bad for femoids desu idk how y'all even live

Yeah, I don't want to be weak and emotional. I guess it helps that I was born to want to achieve things myself, so I enjoy being able to achieve my goals instead of just wanting everything handed to me.

You are coping. Being born a woman in this day and age is like being a princess.

Kind of copey. How did you feel what's it like being a woman? Are you a tranny?

>Weak and emotional
Men are pretty emotional. They just keep that shit bottled up and then blow their brains out.
>so I enjoy being able to achieve my goals instead of just wanting everything handed to me
You are not gonna achieve most of your desires anyways and will work for an Alpha male boss who you will resent.

I do agree that humans are pretty emotional in general, but men are definitely less emotional compared to women, for better or worse.

Not everyone is useless like you and my boss is pretty much the opposite of an alpha male. Even then, I don't plan on staying at where I'm working for the long term.

insane copium, I met my souls mate 5 years ago, She is kinda ugly but we were alike in everyway. Since she ghosted me she has somehow became famous online and got a army of simps and a chad boyfriend who provides her with everything she could ever want. I am smarter then her, I am better looking then her, I am funnier then her, I am put in so much more effort then her, But it doesn't matter she is a mid quirky femoid and everybody loves her whilst I will be alone and live at my parents for the rest of my life.

Sub 8 men are literally just human wallets and canon fodder. There is no sadder existence than a sub 8 males, which is why the male suicide rate is 4x higher than womens.

They keep blowing out their brains a lot though.

Your goals must be kinda pathetic if they are in sight. It's not manly to not go full ad astra.

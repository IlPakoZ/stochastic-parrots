stop with the shinjixkaworu posting ffs, take me back to 2012 please
--- 73169793
Well I got the trash out at least... amazing how the tasks I did without complaint or being asked turned into this huge ordeal once mother was gone. 

One week I'm sure I won't take the cans out to the street simply because I won't feel like it. I need someone to keep me centered and doing basic stuff like that.
--- 73169811
>>73169771
>take me back to 2012
So you can still see kawoshin? This is a kaworu neighboorhood faggot! keep walkin
--- 73169829
Shaved my face tonight to mark a weight loss milestone being reached. I've still got a while to go before I get back into dating.
--- 73169832
I talked to some faggot today and it made me super depressed knowing most people in the world are super vain and don't want intimate and meaningful relationships and only want short term dopamine hits. 

I'll try to keep on living for a few more years and if I'm still depressed like this I'll kill myself. it's not that I hate myself it's that I hate how the world is run. 

How is everyone today.
--- 73169836
>>73169832
How old are you and when is your kms date
--- 73169851
>>73169811
no fuck your ass, it is depressing weeb dream shit that is impossible to find, nobody will ever love and desire unconditionally like kaworu does.
--- 73169870
>>73169836
I am 18 I will do it in 4 years if things are still shitty. 
>>73169851
This makes me want to genuinely cry thinking about it.
--- 73169873
Would you date someone who is 4'9" tall?
--- 73169884
i'd never date a wojakposter
--- 73169888
>>73169851
>dream shit
Uh yeah that's the point. That's the point of 2d posting in general. Its meant to be a look into an ideal world. There is a reason why people abandon 3d and only jack it to and watch 2d.
--- 73169890
that's why you deadass will date a virgin tho fr
--- 73169904
>>73169771
for me, it was marikxbakura. Pretty sure YuGiOh turned me gay.
--- 73169936
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Cause no one could love you like him
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain

So now that he's gone 
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile 

Don't show the world 
How alone you've become.
--- 73169941
>>73169870
Well anon im a year past your death date and i think life is swell. There's so much to craft and read in this world even if im alone in this journey
>>73169873
Yes but not you. I only date gemmy posters

if its not griffth its fucking kaworu or shinji

go back to molesting things i don't care about
stop molesting thing i like you fucking freak
--- 73170102

--- 73170130
>>73170117
Your deeprooted opinion and love that can be crushed by a fag using shinji to blogpost
--- 73170135
>>73170090
Why do you hate me again? Can I ask?
--- 73170171
>>73170130
All i said is that he is molesting things I care about. Its like seeing a woman post about something you like online. Its gross and freaky. Of course you still like the thing however you don't like that the woman likes it. You feel me homie?

>>73170135
because you aren't interesting. You have no personality. Yet you insist on making yourself recognizable via avatarfagging yet you have nothing interesting to share. You're boring.
--- 73170174
>>73170090
honestly the inability to stay with one character is a red flag for me
if they get bored of perfect 2D guys so quickly a real life guy doesnt stand a chance

>I like how you made it extra clear with two examples -_-
lol for your connivence :D and to be thorough 
>>user name
>Made me laugh
good :D i made new accounts for everything to be sure no issues were ran into
>i'm also sure i won't respond to all that.
i find it difficult to talk in short bits, so i like the idea of being able to be as verbose as i want but dont expect reciprocation/ the only way id feel upset is if you were disrespectful in being purposefully short. but if you address only what you feel like and do it competently then i dont care, you can just address only what you want. you can do it here on 4chan or in a paste which you can do anonymously without needing an account. i just want one cause im like that. i put a little arrow in the index on the paste, thats the only section i wanted some response from, or i guess its a section im actually eager for that and picrel i guess

also
>I don't feel like doing much these days 
>I feel worse than ever and i there is no good solution for that if any.

Yeah you should totally date me Anony.

My stomach fucking hurts I need to shower. Got a doctor's appointment tomorrow.

Does anyone here take pictures with a digital camera? Any tips on taking a picture with yourself in the frame?

Nah I just ate some nasty shit quickly and it has my stummy upset.

I got mild scoliosis apparently so that sucks. Need to get it checked out.

This made my cry because the coomer degenerate short term dopamine hit seeker is literally me. I wanted a long term meaningful relationship but I fucked it up by cheating ( long story ).

I met him in a video game and we instantly hit it off. We were unseperable for the first few weeks. He tells me he wants a long term relationship and doesnt like dating for no reason. Tells me he has trust issues from past bfs. I agree because I wanted a serious relationship for the first time in my life and ive never been close to anyone before not even family/friends.

He is basically a shutin like me so we spend all our time together. We would sext each other alot at first but he then he tells me He thinks he is asexual. And wants us to stop doing horny stuff all the time. I agree because emotional stuff is more important to me. 

Im the type of person who is really affectionate and he is more of a cold sarcastic type. I love lovey dovey stuff and puppy love type things (it was my first serious relationship). I would always say I love you and hugs. But he just wouldnt reciprocate at all and would call me weird and cringe.

Overtime time I get kind of fed up because I didnt feel loved. I always felt like he acted like he didnt like me. He never reciprocated my affection but he would spend alot of time with me. I was mad because it felt I liked him way more than he liked me. 

Eventually invites me to his discord with his friends and we play together alot. Always treats me like a simp and would always say things I didnt like " i dont understand why you love me". "Why are you with me ive never even showed you my face before" which was true. I sent him my pics and he did too but never his face. He even said to his friend im not all that.

I always questionned whether he even liked me and I felt lovesick all the time. There were days when he would get mad at me and I would be bedridden from the heartache.

--- 73170571
Why do people have upwards pointing eyelashes? I thought they were supposed to keep things out of your eyes, so shouldn't eyelashes be downwards pointing.
--- 73170574
>>73170553
sorry, bro. it's easy to get tangled up in a onesided relationship when it's your first nad you don't know any better.
--- 73170580
>>73170565
Are you the 28 year old Anon?
--- 73170584
>>73170562
you haven't a hope of what?
--- 73170599
>>73170562
same but i'm gonna get married at 38 and adopt a child with my future husband
--- 73170609
>>73170571
no. when something gets on your eyelash you blink, which shakes it free. if it was downward it would be more likely to be directed into your eye. the upward shape holds it. if they were straight it wouldnt catch anything, but going up it cradles it into a drop that is immediately dropped. as opposed to rolling into your eye
--- 73170624
>>73170580
That's me. I posted there again, so maybe I should move here instead of posting on two different threads, lol.
--- 73170669
>>73170609
My eyelashes point downwards and I don't have that problem.
--- 73170815

>>73170815
don't make him cry, when he's sad you have to love him.
--- 73170862
>>73170553

The only times he showed he cared about me was when he would get a jealous "vibe" from me with his gay friends. He would get sad and cry over me and we would have alot of fights only if something fucked up happened. Only then would he say He liked me.

He never acted like he liked me and so eventually his best friend starts dming me. Starts saying my voice is so hot and starts to flirt with me. And at first I was rejecting him telling him how im loyal. And I thought he was just testing me to see if i was loyal. But all the time he would flirt and say sexual things to me infront of me and my bf and also in dms. 

My bf and I never did anything together anymore so I was susceptible to his horny. I was mad that my bf said I wasnt all that so I sent him a pic of me. He said I was really hot. Still I resisted I said i only sent this pic to prove im not ugly (my ego).
I resisted for many days despite being horny and pent up all the time until one day. I said please stop I cant take it anymore especially because "bf" doesnt do anything with me anymore. And he said. Ik him for a long time I think he is Asexual. He just doesnt want anything with you sexually. And it clicked. I suddenly remembered He did mention that. And so I started sexting his best friend and I released all of my pent up affection into him instead of my bf.

 I was mad because he acted like he didnt even like me or my affection. Would only act jealous and emotional if we fought or if I did something that seemed like I liked his friends. 

I justified it in my head by saying he doesnt even like me im just using his best friend as an outlet for my horny and affection. But I still Love him. He has my heart. 

After sexting his best friend for a couple days, I start thinking wait this is kinda fucked up what im doing I should atleast run this by my bf first. 

>cont. Again
--- 73170888
>>73170862
>I resisted for many days
You are a piece of shit for betraying your bf after only some days.

bruh
--- 73171024
>>73170888
>>73170935
t. weak men who couldn't hold a relationship with a cute boy
anon is in the right. his only mistake was doing that while still being with his ""bf"" instead of cutting his loser dorky "muh asexuality" ass, but i get it was his first relationship so don't judge too harshly.
--- 73171061
>>73170669
then youre wrong
also downward is relative, i was thinking anon was arguing the exact opposite we have now, where the eyelashes have an arch. and if the arch was pointing down it would lead to the eye itself. downward like in your pic seems like its own thing
--- 73171072
>>73170862

After telling him he breaks down crying saying how could I do this. I justified it saying he didnt even act like I was his bf. I felt really bad because he has trust issues about previous exes cheating on him. He tells me isnt Asexual. He gets horny alot but he doesnt want a horny type of relationship like that and wants something meaningful. Saying how he thought i was the "one". I started crying too because I did want all those things I just justified my fucked up thinking by saying he was asexual. And I honestly did screw up my relationship by not atleast asking him first because I was mad at his indifference to me.

I tell him im sorry and ill never do it again I fucked up I thought you didnt like me. Please ill never do it again I love you so much I thought it was okay because you were Asexual.

Doesnt dump me on the spot but a week later. Tells me. I just want to be friends. Were incompatible. Youre just so weird. Everything you do disturbs me. Youre clingy,posessive in a bad way. And youll just get horny for my friends if I dont do anything with you.

I tell him please dont leave me I love you. Ik I fucked up. Please dont go. Ill never do it again. I know what I did was fucked up. 

I knew we were incompatible but it still hurt so much. I wanted to work things through despite my fuck up. It was like my world was shattered. 

Im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry. I wanted a real serious long term thing not only 5 months. Im so lonely without him. I feel so alone. It was such a shock to me. We told each other we would meet and how id never leave him or each other. We use to spend so much time together in call. We even slept in call together. I felt my soul being so fulfilled loving htogetheI feel so alone.
 
Im sorry im sorry im sorry im sorry please take me back ill do anything.

>>73171072
come on, anon. that guy sounded like a socially stunted neglectful jerkwad. you sound like a good boy. keep your chin up, and know that you can do better than that. much better. you deserve someone who'll reciprocate every "I love you" with an "I love you more". I don't know you beyond the story you gave, but you don't seem clingy, obsessive, or weird. you seem like someone with a good heart and with a lot of love to give. I promise you that so long as you don't give up hope and keep the idea in your mind that you can love again, that you'll find a boy who'll take your love and give it back just as much if not more.
--- 73171133
>>73171072
>5 months
how did i know at the end it would be a super short thing. if you fucked it up after only a few months how did you ever expect it to go long term.

Are you sure you aren't the one who is vain and you're rejecting the people who are interested in having a relationship with you, while you only have eyes for the ones who don't?
>I'm not the problem
>Everyone else is
You have so much to learn. Such an inflated ego to deconstruct
--- 73171234
>>73169870
So you had a conversation with one gay guy who didn't want to date you... 
And what you take from that is "I hate how the world is run, nobody is worth my pristine love standards"?
Well this is the perfect board for you. Quintessential incel mindset. 
Have you ever thought that your one bad experience isn't representative of the whole? Or even, that the people who want committed relationships with you are flying under your radar for some reason? 
Do yourself a favor: grow up but don't let this board poison your mind more than what it already has

It baffles me how you keep falling for these ambushes over and over again. 
How on earth can you say you have a "serious committed relationship" or that you love someone whose face you have never even seen before? 
Anon, get fucking real my boy

Thank you for your words. Im literally crying rn.

Im a horrible person because I cheated on him when i used to say stuff like I would never cheat on you.I knew I was saying I love you way too early and it was a red flag but it was genuinely how I felt. I even said how I wanted to marry him.

I couldve atleast asked him but I was mad and embarassed about talking about that stuff with him since he didnt like it. It showed how I cant be trusted and I always fuck up. I wanna be a good person but this shows how im just a degenerate coomer >>73170888 he even got trips im the worst person in the world.

>>73170935
I dont care about porn or cooming. Its more about feeling loved. Im actually scared of sexting I only like the emotional part. And i dont like sending horny pics either.it stresses me out. Most of the time it was them initiating horny. 

Ive watched alot of porn and its not the same thing. I used his best friend as an outlet for my puppy love affection . I would say I wuv you and he would say it back too. And i was imagining it was him saying it back.

My bf told me. You only like fake disingenuine love and that made me cry because i just wanted to love and feel loved back. I wanted a long term thing i wanted to know him deeply. But i fucked it up.
--- 73171352
>>73170862
The fucked up part is seeing all the incels here jumping at your throat for "cheating" when you didn't really cheat because you weren't really in a relationship since these online flings are nothing but s fantasy. They aren't real, they don't matter. They're like a drug that keep you hooked online and detached from the real dating life you should be living 
He wasn't your bf. You weren't in a relationship. You didn't cheat. It's just a bunch of gay retards causing online drama. You deserve more than that. You deserve a real boyfriend in the flesh
--- 73171368

Why are you beating yourself up for this fake relationship bullshit? It wasn't real, anon. None of it was. You never even met these people. Don't lose sleep over them, they're strangers on discord. He wasn't "the one". He wasn't anything. You don't even know his name or his face, thank god.
>Don't leave me
He can't leave you: he was never there in the first place. 
You deserve so much more than this play pretend relationship.
--- 73171416
>>73171072
>I feel so alone.
You were alone with him, silly. He wasn't there with you, ever. 
You didn't fuck up. This fake relationship was doomed from the start. Its end is a blessing in disguise. 
Now you are free to pursue something better than "dating" faceless strangers on discord 
>We told each other we would meet
Biggest lie you have ever told each other
--- 73171427

It wasn't real, anon. You need something real. You need someone who can spend time together with you irl, not just in a call.

You didn't cheat, anon. That wasn't a real relationship. It was just an online fever dream, nothing more. You deserve better. 
>Wanted to marry a faceless strangers I never met before
Do you see how ridiculous it is that you have the same romantic aspiration as a Disney princess? Even Elza is mire reasonable than you. 
Don't let incels here call you a degenerate coomer. You are neither of those things. 
But you are dumb, that's for sure. Dumb for entering these failed anonymous relationships over and over again

You really didn't. You're off the hook. You're better off now. You're free to pursue real relationships in real life, away from this cursed place and other anonymous online cesspools like discord

Tried using some wax shit I bought from the store but it was too weak. I need the nair cream apparently.

I've thought this exact way for about ten years since I was 18. Just want a loving relationship. Most people I've encountered can't be differentiated from wild animals. Mindless simpletons obsessed with social hierarchy and conformism. It doesn't really get easier, your tolerance for it just builds, like a drug addiction.

I know you guys are right and thanks for trying to make me feel betfer. 

I know e-relationships are cringe and that its not a good look. And that im stupid for saying I love you and bf to someone ive never met online. 

But ive always felt like a ghost. I didnt have any meaningful friendships as a kid so i desperately wanted to feel connected with someone and also being a loser shut in. So to me it was real. I loved his voice, his quirks. Everything about him even his bad points. How he would get frustrated at me sucking at video games. And I thought his jealousy was cute. Because only then he showed he cared abt me. I just have alot of love in my heart and I wanted to be loved despite being a shut in unsociable loser.

It still hurts how suddenly he says he doesnt like me for who I am. When we use to say how we would never leave each other. Its like I was in a warm hug and then suddenly im cold and alone all of a sudden. 

I get it though I need something real.

wanting to love makes you human. you've learned though that you shouldn't immediately react when you feel that warmth that someone gives you. or, should I say, you should react, but not excessively. if someone shows interest, you should reciprocate if you're so inclined. but love is a dance, and its pacing is important. you can get closer to someone, say you really like them, but get to know them and enjoy those feelings without saying something that you don't know the gravity of. 
it's harder to do in the moment when you're feeling all that lovey gushiness, but you have to really consider the long term prospects of being with someone. if the thought of love or of a long term relationship crosses the mind, you have to really consider what that would look like. that's why time is important, as you can get clouded by the honeymoon period and energy of a new relationship. get to know them, and if the feeling mutually persists, then consider longer term options
--- 73171873

anon i love you, you cute bitch. you made a mistake but it's not unforgivable. i can tell that your heart is full of love and you're looking for someone to pour it into. you deserve someone better, someone who'll reply to every 'i love you' with enthusiasm. you made a mistake and it's important to learn from it, but what you did does make sense on a human level. god... i relate to this so much man. hey listen keep your head up okay? you're gonna make it, and don't e-date next time! it's only in very, very rare cases that it ends up working out!

D: Nooo, you deserve as peaceful a sleep as it gets anon, not fair... But remember that they're just dreams, okay? It's just like a movie, no one gets actually hurt, everyone is only pretending and acting. Irrationally worrying about your loved ones is one of the most common anxieties to have out there, but despite it being #wholesome #100 try to not get caught up in it, or it'll start controlling you and you'll have no rest whatsoever! But I think you have it all under control, hugging the person involved and telling them what happened hopefully reassures you that everything is (and will be) a ok.
>i've tried doing that before and it turned out pretty well
Color me impressed! I find it really cool when someone is artistic enough to make custom skins. And I know you're already pretty creative with your legos and stuff, so tell me, ever tried drawing before? How about an instrument? Maybe your journal skills could make for an excellent short story!
>is that really perverted to want?

Never know if I do, but I like water.
And today's question of the day is: How many times do you get mistaken as a girl in public?

makes me want to cry. i know the reason is because ive exhausted my distractions, i need to do something new to keep my mind up. ive only made it worse taking a little trip to nostalgia for comfort since the comfort has been gone. i guess now i slowly build up to some idea of what will make my life have purpose, something that will not only distract me but fulfill me, and then quit doing that because its actually annoying, too much work for the rare reward. predictable script after the first four times AND still it goes

I can respond to pic rn. Yeah it's kinda true sure. But also the reason i've become like that is due to a lot of interractions that i didn't really want to have. I think i already said that irl interraction make me very anxious. More so now then ever, even with people i know since forever. I'd always rather be by myself. It's not just trying not to say something wrong and feeling bad physically though that's the main issue, it's also they are kind of boring. And i also don't have much to say either, if anything. Nor do i want to. So yeah. Venting online is much better. Plus i can sometimes talk with anons i have something in common and stuff. 
You are right about small steps and how it seems so hopeless or difficult. That's because it is. 
I will just say that now i have zero desire to work on anything or improve anything. I couldn't do it well enough for the one i loved, there is no way i can do it for myself. I'll live day by day until it gets too hard &lt;3
 all i want is for him to be my bf again but since i know i would just drag him down and make him sad i won't try to contact him again. It's so hard. I'd want to talk to him so badly. I can't stop thinking about him. But if i really love him i have to do what's best for him and that would be leaving him alone. 
>for your connivence :D and to be thorough

well it was a long time ago, but still i appreciate it! i do like being creative, yesh, but im not great at drawing unfortunately :( i have tremmers in my hands due to stress related issues and that makes drawing and keeping my hands still pretty difficult... regardless though, i do do it occasionally and try to get better! i'd love to be able to play music too but im not good at that at all sadly. do you play any nony? :D

when i say you need to be less reclusive i dont mean you must have as many pointless conversations and suffer as much as possible, i guess you can take what i meant to mean as be less reclusive to life itself. scream in a hallway or something, commit a crime, call people slurs,kill john lennon do something that only a corporeal human could do- steal milk and feed strays. youre withering away because youre a candle running out of oxygen, spill over onto the curtain and burn the house down. the thought makes you apathetic but its what you need, what you want to do least is live; so even in apathy do something to live out of pure spite. you cant put your life together because the fragments dont exist

>your spoiler
i cant comment extensively but i doubt he doesnt think about you a lot and i think if he knew you were getting your shit together he would wanna be with you. you should consider maintaining contact because im sure you both love each other a lot and if you ever are able to get stuff together you wouldnt feel like a burden and you could be happy together

 i know he most likely does. I feel guilt over wasting his time. I'm also not sure what he saw in me. Even now when i see him awake at crazy times it breaks my heart. I could still message him but it's for the best that i don't. It's too complicated for someone like me to make it work. It's even worse since he wants to leave his country too so we would have to both get work vissas and stuff in order to live where we planned. It will be much easier if he is alone. I always doubted i could make that plan work. But after not meeting in 3 years and getting older i've lost almost all hope and it was clear to see. It just sucks. He doesn't want to be friends either and i understand that. I would be happy if i could just talk to him but ok 
I will add movies to my list, i already added more but i really don't feel like watching anything. I plan to do so but i just can't focus or manage my time well. I will watch them all at some point tho

It's gone now :(
It was last thing he told me before we broke up, so yeah.. i'd say it's serious. I left it for an hour case i don't like leving it there for a while :)
>you should! i knew youd like that suggestion
Hahaha ye
>usually people dont want to remain friends because its too painful.
That's what he said and now you see why i can't message. It would hurt him. It would draw him into something where there is no good ending. I will have to learn to cope with losing him. Not sure what i would say if he messaged. I would hope it would be something silly that ignores the fact we didn't talk for a while now. Acting like it's just another day. That would make me burst out laughing and i would cry too. But like i said i don't think it can work in our situaton so it would only hurt after a while. He wouldn't like that gn/gm thing :(
We also ended on bed terms now so it would be weird for me to message back yet again.

They aren't full blown nightmares most of the time, it's just that they commonly feature a bunch of stuff I find triggering, especially once I wake up. And I've only got jumpscared to the point of waking up a handful of times. But I do sweat a lot when I sleep, I think it's something to do with my medication.
Man sucks to hear about your tremors, you just can't seem to get a break, huh? ;-; Interestingly I once had them as well when I was still getting used to a particular antidepressant. But as I am someone to whom repetitive behavior acts in a self-soothing manner I found pretty neat :D But they eventually went away...
I don't know how to play anything either, but I do like music a LOT. Used to own a synthesizer once, but I didn't play jack on it desu.
>perviness
Well it isn't that common among boys I think. Somehow they always neglect huge chunks of their body when playing :\ But it's much less deviant than wanting to get choked for instance. So it's just a tad bit fruity imo. So you shouldn't worry yourself with that, I would be much more concerned about the whole "giving up total control to fbf" thing >:3 I can't wait once you discover breath play! You little semen-demon :D (or would it be angel?)
>your insanity
Don't get me wrong, everyone's feelings are valid, but your problems seem more teenage-girl tier rather than 4chan tier. But gatekeeping sucks so don't be discourage nony. Although don't let this place take a toll on you, monsters create other monster and so on ^-^

Not after what happened later. It was before we stopped talking. It was a very stupid argument but it was more of an issue of me having a hard time improving and him being a bit colder towards me, tho he was still very sweet when i did a good job. Actually he tried to be nice still but it hurt he wasn't really interested in mundane, everyday talks like we used to have. He tried to motivate me :c
>lol thanks
No thanks, it was a mistake ;-; i thought i clicked 1h dammit
>im usually careful but sometimes im really not. but 90%

>dont rush! dont let it be a mental drag!
It might bug me until i do it. Depends on how i feel as i seem to procrastinate everything these days. I'll try to answer as much as i can tho
>i dont like being more specific desu
Neither do i! Believe it or not i used to be very careful about stuff like that. I didn't even talk about myself or my life at all (ok maybe occasional "i don't like my family or my life" thread or some shit, but even then it was very vague) nor did i have some more meaningful conversations before this year. I kinda gave up on the idea that i have much to lose, so it doesn't bother me to scream about my situation into the void or talk about it with someone when i feel like it or when someone will listen. I sometimes feel better after getting certain thoughts out of my head. Usually not ;-;

Just had a ruined orgasm instead of properly finishing. I was still trying but after a while I gave up.

i think it's something that parents realize about their gay kids intuitively but that concern manifests as homophobia and a selfish desire for grandchildren instead of being communicated.
--- 73177198
maybe it's because both sides of our family have a lot of brothers and sisters with kids, but I don't really feel like we're lacking in the family department. sure, we may never be able to have kids [of our genes], but I still feel like I have a big family.
--- 73177199
>>73177118
I don't really know how it is compared to not taking them. But it is significantly easier for me to cum while the prostate is stimulated as well. I'd imagine that they increase the threshold even there, but not nearly as much as with the pp.

Maybe the problem is that you are coomers, and not that you're gay?
--- 73177337
>>73177218
Haven't pressed it in ages though... That would require using both hands and I would need to wash them as soon as I'm done. And for some reason I frequently get hungry for even more after cumming with it, unlike with pp only where the lewd thoughts pass away rather quickly.
I don't care at all for the negative effects of them desu. I used them for ocd and I'd trade a bunch of my other emotions and body functions to get the thoughts out of my brain. So I only look for efficacy when using them.
And as mentioned, maybe it's for the best to stop self-pleasuring myself, I'm already as deviant as it gets with fetishes...

This is e relationships for you. It's all a lie. They'll string you along for months with this cutesy love dovey talk, but it's absolutely meaningless. In the next moment they'll ghost you and you won't even be able to reach out because it was all anonymous. You can't build relationships based on anonymity. It's not real. It's just a fantasy.

You are living in the best day and age to be gay. You can even marry. 
It's not about what cards you were dealt with by life. It's about playing the best possible game with what you've got. 
Instead of wasting your seed with porn, give it to someone real. Make it special. You won't feel so bad about being gay if you try gay dating.

>Gay pride is so fucking stupid
No it isn't. Gay pride is the only thing that can save you from these self hating thought patterns. 
It's the lack of self acceptance more than the gayness itself that fucks you up.
--- 73177858
>>73177018
And ever since 10th grade you've been becoming more and more isolated and self hating. 
The gayness is contained inside your head, and that's a big problem. It's like you don't reap any benefits from being gay, like dating men. 
Give it a try, and you'll suddenly feel way more thankful for being gay.

Of course I do! It's like a the most practical discipline out there, and for some reason I just find guys solving problems to be quite manly. FYI: I'm kinda the totally opposite of that :D
So radios, huh? What's so cool about them for you? I mean I totally get the whole invisible magic appeal part of it, but you get that with any wireless system out there, right? Ever received a SAQ Grimeton broadcast?
I find CPUs sooo cool! Wish that there were more open-source variants of them :( And I wished that IC's could be examined with the bare eye, just like a motherboard for instance, but I guess that's the tradeoff for speed and ease of production. What kind of instruction set did your designs use?

radios are wonderful because they let us reach out and touch people without ever meeting them. even the smartest person might have trouble explaining in sufficient detail how a circuit is able to be created through air using antennas- ohms and kirchhoffs laws fail to explain it so some aspect of electromagnetics must be used. lol all my cpus were cisc and not very good at that. one was written in verilog and was actually realized using a fpga

It is a fantastical thing indeed. They excel at using infrastructure that's already present (space) instead of requiring new one to be built whenever you wanna reach some place new. Timeless tech for sure. I though always get too paranoid when using wireless ways of data transmission, it just doesn't stick right with me that it's flowing out there in the open, no matter the encryption used.
I know literally nothing about the actual inner workings of chips and the like, so it's probably way out of my league to ask this, but what exactly made your processor bad at complex instructions? And why didn't you then just use simpler ones instead?

Even so, it would still be an experience worth having. A little step forward in the journey. Today you might flake and ghost, but if you did that several times, maybe in a few months you'd feel a tiny little bit more comfortable with talking to guys, even if infinitesimally so, it would still be an improvement. Little by little you can get far. 
Your mindset is so defeatist even when hypothesizing, you can only think about all the excuses for not doing it

its on recent research on backscatter communication systems. they are like badge readers to let you into places- the reader supplies all the energy to the badge and the badge harnesses it and sends data back to the reader without having a battery. things like barcodes at the grocery store are technically a form of backscatter as the laser hits the barcode and the different stripes reflect a pattern back into the laser which it detects. anew advancement is ambient backscatter systems, where the energy is supplied by sources outside of the backscatter system. that means using existing radio waves like wifi and tv to illuminate the backscatter tag for the reader. also lots of mimo

I mean, I can blame you in a way, and not in others. You're a victim of your own defective mind, that's for sure. At the same time you still have agency over your life as an adult, but you do nothing with it. 
I guess you're just extremely weak, but can you blame a weak man for being weak? I don't know. Maybe your father could have helped you, your mother clearly didn't have a clue what she was doing. But it's too late for that now. 
I wish I could be there by your side and coach you through life like a fairy godmother, but nobody can do that except you. But you won't do it. 
It's very frustrating, storyanon. Your whole situation is the epitome of frustration. I feel like punching you in the face. How can you be so willing to just roll over and perish? How can someone be so fundamentally broken inside? How could you have let it get this far without reaching for help?

It does matter. Straight people have higher reported happiness, lower rates of drug abuse, lower rates of mental illness, less chance of being assaulted or abused, more stable relationships, etc.

Sure you can say all of the above is due to "Discrimination" but it holds in countries with high gay acceptance like Denmark.

plus 2 times in middle school. 

Anyway

once because I corrected this gangsta type dude because he said something wrong in class. Just straight up walked over to me and started slugging me. Teacher was an old woman and couldn't stop him and had to run to get a male teacher to pull him off.

second time wasn't really my fault, I accidentally stepped on someone's shoes in the hallway and they just turned around and decked me. crumpled from once punch and started crying, the guy only threw the one punch though, then tried to claim he didn't actually hit me. Cameras proved my story though. 

Third was when I refused to let someone copy off me during a test. Waited until after school and jumped me on my way out of the building.

But that's a very reasonable thing, we do have disability pride month as well. In a world that tells them they're defective and broken, these people rise with their newfound pride to be their best selves. This is who they are. They were born this way (remind you of something?) and there's no changing it. 
They can live their entire lives being ashamed of being different, or they can learn to love every bit of themselves, flaws and qualities alike, and be proud of it. 
In the end of the day, you still see your homosexuality as your weakness. You have so much to learn from handicapped people. 
People are strange, and you're the strangest of them all. But what's stranger is you not loving who you are, including the gay part.

No, no it's not. If you want perspective on this topic from someone who is actually disabled, read 2arms1head. Disabled people acting "proud" and "loving themselves" gives the image to others that being disabled doesn't suck, which it does.
--- 73180895
>>73180796
>dont want to have parades and stick it in peoples faces
You think that being out in the streets is sticking up to anyone's face? You have stray dog syndrome, it's like you only believe your sexuality is valid if it's hidden from view, kept indoors like a shameful secret. 
Do you think that straight couples in public are sticking it up in your face?
The only reason why you have freedom to be gay and even marry a man is because of those parades. 
>oh, alright" nothing more than that

You think discrimination doesn't exist in developed countries?
You are literally the face of what homophobia can do to a gay person: make them hate themselves after a lifetime of being taught gayness is evil. Make them repress their sexualities with terrible side effects on their mental health. 
You're like the quintessential example of how discrimination affects gay people's upbringing, but you're so blinded by your internalized homophobia that you would rather blame the gays themselves instead of the gay hating world the brought us here

--- 73180988
>>73180884
I think you are the one who needs a broader perspective. Regardless of how being handicapped sucks, it's their life and there's no changing it. 
When you go around reminding people of all their limitations and all the ways their lives will be harder, you're just being mean for no purpose. 
Rather than focusing on what they can't do, proud handicapped people rise from the abyss of self pity (where you live) to remind you of all the innumerous ways they can overcome their challenges and live a fulfilling life, and for that they need self acceptance and pride. 
You want them to focus solely on the negative parts of their lives because that's what you're doing, and that's just being cruel, anon. You're being cruel to yourself.

That's the self hating mindset. 
Being gay is, simply. It is what it is. It doesn't matter what your life would be like if you weren't gay, you are gay, there's no changing that. 
So instead of focusing on the million ways you can overcome your challenges and find love and fulfilment as a gay guy, you keep wallowing in self pity hating yourself for not being born normal. 
You do have much to learn from handicapped people

>you're a big joke you know that right
Yeah keep thinking that brown boy! One of these days you will be walking home to your shitty favela housing and behind you you vill here heavy labored breathing. You will turn around and see me there. As you turn to run I will fall on your crushing you under my massive body. You will cry out for someone to stop me but none will because your country is a shithole. The last thing you will hear is "OHHH SIM, VOCE CHEIRA MUITO BOM, MENINO" before you are UTTERLY and TOTALLY RAPED

>id just be one of the discrete gays, no?
You are one of the discreet gays. Your discretion is so extreme that you inhabit the depths of the closet alone in secret. 
you hate yourself so much you can't even talk with a gay guy without the cover of anonymity.
--- 73181495
>>73181434
>socializing in that way makes me feel sick
You mean you are so sexually repressed you can't even talk with other guys? 
Yeah, pretty much stemming from your self hatred too
--- 73181511
>>73181483
You're not the first self hating fag to hunt for the gay cure, and sadly you won't be the last. 
Most of them use prayers or other hocus pocus though. 
You will try so hard, for so long, to get rid of the gay, until you realize how much easier it is to get rid of the internalized homophobia. On That day you'll be free

I won't live to see it, maybe, but it will happen and my spirit will look fondly on the hetero world below. I will plant the gay cure so that the gay men of the future can lay under the heterosexual tree

You're blind and in denial. Your internalized homophobia and lack of self acceptance are one of the main reasons why you are incapable of dating men.

i dont think so. i think im just generally insecure and adverse to people taking interest to my thoughts and life. the only thing specific to dating is an added layer of intimacy and expectation. which to be fair are the worst layers

absolutely based.
keep them away from faggy stuff, be a great father figure, treat their mother like a princess and live with love.
that done, you can be quite sure of a good upbringing.
careful not to go into an ignorant facade of Christianity where you're just oppressing them.

You have some nerve saying that in the same post where you tell a gay man to marry a woman and keep his family away from queerness 
Whatever you think the intolerant facade of christianity is, you're closer to it than you admit

Why hasn't straight people eliminated LGBT individuals?
The answer is the same. 
You want to purge degenerates so badly that you end up forgetting you are one
--- 73182114
>>73182095
so you agree homosexuals are degenerate. hah.
--- 73182145
gentlemen
i have just touched myself to homoerotic images
--- 73182238
>>73182114
Do you realize that everyone in this site is a degenerate, including you, right?
degeneracy is just a word, and it's often used to mean anything that isn't straight people married. 
I don't have any trouble admitting it. I'm not the self hating queen in denial. That's you. 
You hate being gay so much that you look for reasons to diminish our worth, even when we're living the dream of building a family. 
What years of prejudice have done to you

every woman ive talked to has either blatantly ignored me sharing anything about my interests or has directly told me its lame or otherwise.

i gave up trying to have a personality with women and resorted to just being whatever they wanted and calling it a day. 

and dont think about talking about feelings because they dont care. ive had them tell me its annoying or again just straight up ignored it. even when they say "you can tell me". its all a lie and a facade.

ive talked to women of many types and its a universal occurrence. no one will ever care about you.

They do care, but only if you're attractive. Also, 90+% of women will never care about your deep feelings, that's just the reality so you were at least right about that. Opening up to a romantic interest if you're a straight guy is a mistake 99% of the time. Women want to feel safe and seeing that level of vulnerability in their partner will destroy all attraction they have to you almost every time. 

How women treat you is dictated almost solely by how attracted they are to you. The only other way to get treated well by women is to be the 'nice friend' archetype, but good luck getting girls with that.
--- 73048791

--- 73048793
Women are interested only in your interests if you are ambitious in them. Don't expect women you pursue for relationships to be like male friends. It's a completely different dynamic. You want male friends to share interests with and to "resonate" with but you don't necessarily want that in a romantic relationship. 

I think we are fucked mentally because a lot of media when we were young presented this idea that women are essentially just males in female bodies. They have all the same motivations, interests etc as us.
They just don't dude. Women are not like us at all. They are driven by an entirely different set of evolutionary pressures. 

Women WILL push you to improve in objective metrics. I've seen insanely rich dudes whose wives have everything but still do this. Don't expect them just to be happy with what you are. Some are more overt in this than others but they are all like this. Expecting just to be fellated for everything you already are is a narcissistic fantasy. Only women have that privilege because all we want is their companionship. 
Just how the game goes man

a warm body to cuddle, someone to do things with, someone to cook for you if they're good. Yeah it's depressing man but women just don't have the same the same cognitive make up as us. 

It's all biology. Just maybe don't think about it too much and just go with the flow of life. Trying to analyse women WILL completely fuck you up mentally and you will come to the conclusion that we are all just slaves in a biological prison. It's best just to not go there.

idk man. you end up relying on them or just empty soulless back and forths about nothing. even when you try to express yourself it gets ignored for another random message about nothing.

a lot of my interests got baseded or i just stopped caring

>>73048733
unironically it seems like that.

>>73048741
my feeds on everything are nothing but egirls talking about sex or guys no matter how much i tell it im not interested.

>>73048751
in too retarded to see the exact point. but i dont think talking about some game or some random thing that's bothered me is extreme. if this is something about sex or fetishes then it doesnt apply because i hate talking about that with women.

>>73048776
ive tried most my life to stay away from that mindset. but ive had 3 girls stop talking to me to get a bf after saying they like me. and i cant help but feel like its because the other guys have to be more attractive than me or just less weird and retarded. idk man. women seem to lie when they say stuff about nerdy or awkward or sensitive guys. it seems like its all just a lie for some vague approval

>>73048793
some of the other points probably apply to this too. but yeah, the whole be who you are thing feels more and more like a lie.

>>73048828
yeah and im saying its a lie. women get annoyed when you start talking about your interests. they just dont want you to be yourself. they dont actually have any enjoyment out of you talking.
--- 73048936
>>73048898
it's a complete headfuck because women have no consistency in the way they treat things. They can be insanely caring one second and then insanely callous the next. 
Their nurturing drive is driven mostly by things that appear cute or defenceless. Do not conflate this with empathy. Empathy is a completely different trait. Empathy is the ability to imagine yourself in the shoes of another, no matter who that person is. Women don't do that. They can easily psychopathically discard anything they don't deem worthy to them.
--- 73048948

Its your face and height, fucking retard. Ive had women tell me negative shit about my interests or feign disinterest, but when a chad says that exact dame thing, the women light up and start raving about how much they like X or Y my hobby.

Breaking bad, for example. I had a girl tell me how childish I was to watch it, that it sucked, that she hated it, that I was a freak for watching it. Then next day chad started talking about it and she rushed over gushing about how much she loved it, how cool it was, how she watches it over and over again.

Its over.

Blackpill moment. Because those are their favorite hobbies, which they do every single day (EVERY SINGLE DAY) without thought, while you have never even experienced it once in your life.

Its fucking over.

>>73048922
>women seem to lie when they say stuff about nerdy or awkward or sensitive guys
They like awkward Chad since it makes them feel less insecure about losing him, and because he's easier to control. In the end, women are just after different flavors of Chad. And by Chad I don't mean the boorish, cocky archetype, I mean successful, attractive, socially smooth men. 

For example, chances are when a girl thinks about a 'awkward bf' she's focusing on the physical aspect. If she says she 'wouldn't mind an average looking guy', she's probably imagining a guy with a smooth personality. 

In the end, women want Chad, and make compromises to sate their own anxiety about losing him, or to satiate their own fetishes like having a lot of control over a guy.
--- 73048967
>>73048890
Yeah. And a lot of anger from being fed lies about it.
You know how it goes. Treat women well, the romance in fiction, in songs, in inspirations from art. It paints this incorrect imagery that love is something common.

But love from a woman towards a man does not exist; they didn't specify that this love is only from the man to the woman. And that man has to be physically attractive.

I'm good looking but blackpilled to fuck. I've been in constant relationships but find them completely unfulfilling emotionally. I know it's better than being alone but there is still an existential terror to knowing that this person is only with you because you were born with a genetic makeup that makes your appearance attractive. 
I feel like I was just fed nothing but lies as a child about what love is. It literally isn't real. Or as >>73048967 said can only exist from a man to a woman. There is no reciprocation. There is no two way connection. We are simply vessels staring into the void.

Yeah this is spot on as well. I remember seeing multiple femanons posting here that they love their submissive bfs, but would dump them if they went bald. That pretty much sums up that it's their nurturing instinct getting mixed up with attraction, not actual empathy. 

I think that's also why women hate low status men and completely fail at empathizing with them. It's like that stat that says '1/4 homeless people are women'. I always wondered why it seemed like I empathized with low status men suffering while women were completely callous to it. Your distinction cleared all of that up though. 

Women only feel towards men they feel attraction to or nurturing feelings to. Very rarely will they feel genuine empathy. 

Now that I think about it, I think that's why I have way better connections with men, since they feel real empathy.

You do realise we live in pretty much the only time in human history where women weren't considered second class citizens? I don't think it's really any coincidence that pretty much all cultures independently came to this conclusion. Women can not be trusted or relied upon when it comes to matters of any significant importance or judgement. Everything about them is completely fickle.

>pretty much the only time in human history where women weren't considered second class citizens? I don't think it's really any coincidence that pretty much all cultures independently came to this conclusion
I actually have thought about this before, and fear an inevitable collapse built on inversing what has traditionally worked in cultural evolution. Anyways, I was heavily brainwashed with feminists ideals growing up. The older I get though and the more women I talk to and get experience with, the less I respect them. Men and women simply aren't the same. 

Women care way less about abstract things and get lost way more in their own emotions and the moment than men. I feel like they're terrible at long term decision making since they always frame it in the context of 'how would this make me feel'. I feel like you need genuine empathy to be a good, utilitarian decision maker.

>For scientific reasons, I made gpt4 create a story describing the use of poppers as a woman during anal sex. 

As James got inside of Sarah's body, she finally decided to try a sniff from the bottle. The effect of it hit immediately, intensifying her sensations and emotions and replacing her doubts and anxieties for a craving euphoria for deeper sensations.

James noticed this and started to gently caress her to which Sarah's body reacted shivering with pleasure. Her hands gripped the bedsheets tightly, her breathing became heavier, and her body arched, pressing closer to him, seeking even more contact and touch.

When James increased the rhythm and intensity of his thrusts, Sarah felt her inner muscles, including her anal sphincter, relax and dilate. The sensation was pleasurable and intense, making her feel more open and receptive to the experience. 

The thrusts made a pressure built inside her. Sarah couldn't contain her passion any longer. She let out a passionate scream, releasing the overwhelming pleasure and desire she felt. Her body trembled, and her legs wrapped around James, drawing him closer.

Sarah's hands moved from the bedsheets to James' back, running her fingers along his skin, communicating her love and desire through her touch. Between gasps and moans, she whispered words of encouragement and appreciation, telling James how amazing he made her feel and how much she loved being close to him.

Throughout their intimate encounter, Sarah's body language and movements reflected her heightened emotions and sensations. Her hands, feet, and voice all expressed her deep craving for connection and pleasure, creating an unforgettable experience for both her and James.

anyone shilling any sort of personality adaptation, game, or dark psychology needs to to be tortured to death. women like it when you talk to them if your jaw has a certain width to it. that's literally it. you can literally express diaper fetish stuff to the most normal or religious of attractive women if you're goodlooking enough (i've seen it happen). doesn't matter what you say, matters what you look like

Fucked up if true. Poe's Law applies to violent threats; it's impossible to tell if they're real or not. I stopped by /k/ early last month and caught a pretty legit looking schizo rant by an anon promising to carry out a shooting for Columbine day 4/20. Jannies deleted it fast but nothing seems to have ended up happening.

wasnt he saying 4chan memes during his shooting or was that also a made up fact

Same thing happened with the shooting back on February. I made a thread on the 13 asking what were the odds of a shooting on Valentine's and some dude posted a picture of his gun with the text "odds are looking good cowboy". SUPPOSEDLY that's the same gun that was used in a shooting a couple hours later. Everyone thought I also made that post even though I only made the thread. I have no idea if the post ended up being linked to the shooting or not, and I'm mexican so the FBI won't be getting anything out of me haha.

Here's the thread for anyone who is curious: https://desuarchive.org/r9k/thread/72215705

Sounds like the FBI came to this conclusion simply because of lack of evidence (since it would be virtually impossible to prove it).

That's at least one or two different shooters after him (ex.: Tarrant).

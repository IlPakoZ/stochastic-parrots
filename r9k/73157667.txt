It's cause ice cream and chips are fatty food and they're making fun of your belly and boobs.

They're trying to see if you're going offer them snacks.

Don't cause you will waste money and they will never pay you back for the snacks they eat.

Don't take it personally, it wouldn't matter which snacks you chose. The judgement comes from the fact that you'll be eating all of them alone.

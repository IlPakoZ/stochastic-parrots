I just shaved my head for what will be the final time, at least for a few months. I want to spend a few months growing my hair to see how much I have left by this point. 

(not me in the pic, but I looked almost identical to this back in late 2019, I believe my hairline has retreated and my general hair has thinned quite a bit since then)

I wish I could pull the shaved head look but I look like the guy on the right but with more prominent browridge and slopping forehead

I saved it from this board. He gets posted here a lot. It's rare I see someone that could look like my identical twin. So I saved it to use when trying to describe myself.

Do you look worse than this? (again, not me in the pic)

>I wish I could pull the shaved head look
You just need to get to the point where you realize you don't pull off the unshaved head look either. By which point you can come to terms with and be at peace with having a shaved gay alien skull.

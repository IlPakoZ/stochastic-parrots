any 30+ virgins here? I just turned 29 and I've come to terms with the fact I'm going to be a 30 year old virgin.

32 as well. When I hit 30, I was like "Wow, I unironically am a wizard lol" 
Just stopped caring. It is what it is. I won't be surprised if the wizard race increases like crazy. A lot of sexless men now and days.

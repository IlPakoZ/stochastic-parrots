Try them all. It's a number's game. Also, if you're a grown ass man and have your shit together, matchmaking/matrimony websites might work better for you.
I know reddit is "le big bad" in here, but there's this subreddit called r/foreveralonedating. Send 3 DMs everyday to profile of your choice, and within 3 years you're statistically almost guarenteed to find something (even if 1 in every 1000 women find you attractive).
People here don't get laid because they don't put themselves out there.
Also, BIG DISCLAIMER: Most attemps will elad to rejection, but if it works 5% of the time, then that's 1 women for every 20 attempts, or 10 women for every 200 attamepts, or 100 women for every 2000 attempts. If you're the kinda guy who'll try 5 times then give up than it's guarenteed not to work.

You eventually just learn to use logic above all, which makes life completely empty. You come to understand its empty and accept it for what it is, because when you're ready to leave you know you can at any time.
Basically just acceptance. It will happen with time or if you're unable to view things from a simple point of view like "life's good"
Instead you will ask why life is good, look into those mechanics, realize how at its core it is awful, and end up not expending energy on stress or sadness.
If you're not the thinker let time numb your emotions. If you're a thinker good work, you get to exist meaninglessly.
--- 73095043
>>73094941
The cure is simple: GET YOURSELF OUT THERE. Go to match making websites, send 3 DMs a day for 3 years. It is STATISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE for you to find nothing. Even at a 0.1% success rate, you'll still manage to land a woman. This is what you guys don't understand, it's not even about self improvement, it's just the sheer lack of exposure that's killing your chances. If the only time you speak to a woman is when you check out your groceries at walmart, then you'll end up single forever no matter how much self improvement you implement. This is why black people get laid often (and a lot of them are UGLY AS SIN), it's because they're all over the place: they are very low inhib, they DM any girl they want, they attend events all over the city, they're always vocal on twitter about something, they make 10 sexual advances aday. THIS is the missing ingredient, not "looks" or "self Improvement" (looks do matter a lot, but they're useless without the exposure).
--- 73095068
>>73094951
To add on: You can only feel things like sadness/sorrow/guilt/etc from ego. Learn to let go of it due to the meaninglessness of life, hence the logical point of view. It also means you let go of happiness, but that's fine - the elimination of your emotions if what matters.
And yes, this is objectively a coping method; if you can tap into it, use it. You don't seem like you're close to apathy, so you will need time or enough suffering that you can no longer feel.

You really think 2 out of every 3 posts here are genuine? You're crazy. I'd say 1 out of every 10 posts is NOT a psyop, at best. Having seen this board a decade ago and comparing it to now, I feel like I'm one of the few remaining actual anons here.

>>73095043
What you don't understand is that those odds are awful and demoralizing in and of itself. People here want to have a decent opportunity - throwing out hundreds of messages, either with or without effort in a short time span to play the numbers game, makes it feel completely empty. Its the same reasoning why most people don't play the lottery. I do not want to engage with something this awful where I'm set up to lose.

I am a 5'3", 97 lbs manlet subhuman who gets confused for a young teenage boy despite being nearly 26 years old, even when growing facial hair. It's like my puberty ended halfway through, so I'm basically only attractive to the .01% of females that are literal pedophiles, except I'm not even an actual child. On top of that I am a diagnosed autismo who struggles with social interactions and lives off of autismbux at my parents. I am uncomfortable with anything relating to intimacy and have escaped the very rare instances in my life when a girl has potentially shown interest in me. Even my own mom only got to get a hug out of me about twice in my life as far as my memory goes. I struggle to look at people in the eyes when talking to them, I've had no friends for the past 5 years, and I all around live in my own mind. All I do of my time is spend countless hours on my computer rotting my brain away at 4chan and watching Twitch streams to create the illusion of a social life that I can never truly have, even in the few friend groups that I've been in years ago I was either the outcast or they were about as autismo as me. I also do some home tasks for my mom during the day, especially since she recently had her uterus removed (cancer). I only ever go outside for walks, when getting a haircut or occasionally going to the store.

I am most likely never getting a gf, no matter what. I have to learn to accept my fate.

A simp: Beats arround the bush, is afraid to be sexual, buys her shit, hangs arround for more than a few weeks, is very meek and sumbissive.
A man: Makes his exual advances directly and from day 1 (in a subtle way, don't just say "I find u hot, let's fugg"), either gets her or moves on, doesn't develop onetis, doesn't hang arround for more than 1 week if it leads to nothing, doesn't buy her shit, is speaking to 4 different women at the same time.

congrats, you know how to make women fucking HATE you. and not in a good way. they will treat you like garbage if these intentions are clear

Nichemax. Some girls like cute/adorable/shy guys. Just make sure to increase your exposure. Expect a shitload of rejections and a few wins, cling to those wins and you'll get a gf. what I said in other replies basically. Also, don't put on a fake extroverted/tough guy act. Wear your weaknesses like a shield and they shall never be used against you. Your shyness and "softness" will be your assets to get the girls who are into this.

It's the one that requires the most calibration and cames with the highest cost of messing up. God forbid he does it in his campus and acquires a reputation. Hard disagree.

Thats you, theres ugly guys that arent awkward making womens days and women enjoy these guys company

Women want to have fun and feel good

I dont believe autism is a factor anymore since its just them being awkward since they dont have much experience, you can literally fix it by practice. Theres also hideous dudes that have a great sex life. And no, they dont pay her, take her out, none of that cupcake shit
--- 73095836
>>73095829
Then perhaps you won't get women after all.

That's what I said from the beggining
--- 73095839
>>73095782
Cold approaching is direct, fast, and efficient. If hes awkward or creepy then yeah hell get problems. Put your bid in and get out. Thats why women say creepy, cause the dude keeps rambling on
--- 73095849
>>73095831
Women are generally attracted to the same handful of features (tall, strong jaw, hunter eyes, etc.)

Autism literally means your brain is wired incorrectly for social shit, it's not a matter of "experience"

This. Once guys get some steam going and have women in and out of their lives, they dont get bothered by it
--- 73095866
>>73095839
Even if you put your bid and get out you'll acquire a reputation as "the guy who approaches women" in your workplace or university/school. Don't shit where you eat. Women are open to being cold approached in nightclubs and not elsewhere.

Black men are one of the more sexless demograics outside a minority, and the hoodrats having all the sex are fucking obese hoodrats normal men wouldn't want to touch in a million years.

Single does not mean sexless. Do you think a Tyrone who fucks 2 girls a week will say that he's in a relationship?

What's the point when every other guy who she's turned down this week is more desirable than you?
--- 73095915

I never said this. Dude thinks this stuff js holding him back so i told him to get it out the way. Why? Cause hell deal with that stuff, then hell have no excuse left
--- 73095932
>>73095888
It's shows your inability to secure one. Picture this: Guy approaches Becky, she says no, then goes to Stacy, she says no, then moves to Sarah, she says no. Beck, Stacy and Sarah meet up for lunch and discuss their interactions with the guy. It has been now established that he is unable to get a woman and that he failed at achieving abundance. His social status goes to the dumps.
Also, HR will fire his ass.
The biggest advantage of cold approach, anonymity, is lost.
--- 73095941
>>73095849
Guys are generally attracted to the samw features
>nice titties or ass
>pretty face
So? Theres models with a million followers and girls think all guys want that yet they would date a girl they find attractive who isnt a model or nothing. Di you know that most dudes and women dont look like chad or stacy and yet have good relationships and sex lives?
--- 73095954
>>73095941
The difference is girls can all flock to the few guys who do have those features, while most guys have to fight over the scraps
--- 73095955
>>73095914
How do you that?
If the guy was more desirable, why did she turn him down?
Put your bid in and get out. Thats it. Nothing else
--- 73095967
>>73095932
This is a fake scenario you make uo in your head. Youre infected with a mind virus. Look up Mr. Locario to help you with this. Hes a master at game

Cope, I'm in highschool in the Midwest and the biggest slayers are black guys because they are low inhib and confident and sociable. Not autistic neets like the average r9kcel
--- 73096017
>>73095967
I've been in "game" for close to a decade now. I'm not blackpilled and I've had mustiple relationships in the past. This just my conclusion and the conclusion of multiple dating coaches. It's almost an unspoken rule in the PUA communikty (before the redpill even became a thing). There's a lot of things a man can do to attract a woman, but being over-optimistic and adopting this "I can do anything" mindset is what gave pick up advice such a bad reputation for incels (and rightfully so). I can guarentee you that if the average /r9k/bot started cold approaching at random in their university or workplace that it will be a trainwreck of monumental proportions.
--- 73096023

Blackpill
Redpill
Its all bullshit
Guys who are bad with women, goofy, awkward, low self esteem, get a bad reputation cause they did it to themselves. They always approach with a losers mindset and a winners. They get stunned when they see a guy who believes in himself and doesnt hold himself back
--- 73096059

Well then fix it. The Guy would

>>73096049
How do you have a winner's mindset when you're the polar opposite of everything a woman looks for in a man?
--- 73096068
>>73096049
So you think a guy from here can start approaching his coworkers and everything will go down smoothly with no HR complaints or anything.
--- 73096086
>>73095043
This is true. I've been researching blackpill and lookism recently and came across videos where blackpillers are perplexed normie guys have gfs. They even autistically made theory for it called "oofy doofy theory". 

https://youtu.be/65HrtrS0mTE [Embed]

They don't understand that simply being neurotypical and sociable plus approaching tons of women will eventually get you a gf. They sit in their basements researching which autistic surgeries to get instead of improving their personalities.
--- 73096088
>>73096068
Yes. He just needs to put his bid in. Also guys need to talk to women outside of work. Ive seen dudes try to pick up women at work and they can tell he doesnt talk to women outside of it

>>73096065
You just have a winners mindset. Also, yoh identify everything that bothers you yet dont want to fix it. Winners work on everything

--- 73096279
>>73096258
I'm not being pedantic at all. You don't understand statistics. There are more men who want to date than there are dateable women (Women who aren't total sluts, whores, skanks, and chad chasing holes). Pigeonhole principle makes it impossible for every man to get a gf.

Acoording to currently available estimates from 2021, there are 101 men for every 100 women in the world. This means that ONLY 99.00990099% of the male population can be matched with a single female. This number goes down to a STAGGERING 98.99% if we factor in polygamy.

you don't have to become a scientology member either, that doesn't mean the guy handing out pamphlets isn't a shill trying to get you to join.

in case you haven't noticed this is how every self-help guru does business: give out bits of free information, then promote their service once the viewer's reeled in. literally no different then how andrew tate, rich cooper, papa swolio, etc, do business. it's shameful because it preys on lonely men who believe this one guy can change their lives. you should be ashamed of yourself because you're shilling this on a board full of lonely men knowing that some of them will take the bait.

Taunting retards is hilarious, bro. Good thread.

fuck this hurts so much. i was a retard in hs and fell for a stacy when i was out of my league. she always took pics of me for snapchat (picrel is one of them) and it was only later on that i realized she was mocking me.

kek

There was this actual rich blonde stacy I grew up with. The first time we met, in grade 1, this bitch just kicks me in the balls. In grade 8 she gets all flirty and tries pretending she liked me but I always ignored her or pretended like I didn't know she was flirting. I think she was just low-key turbo-autist but she was rich and looked normal so she could mask easy. She would get so frustrated because I would talk to all of the other girls normally, but low-key reverse-mock her.

One day I tell her, in front of a ton of people eating lunch, that she only talks to me when she wants something. She wanted some of my pizza and a sip of my coke. I told her to beat it and gave some to everyone else. Fuck she was embarrassed as shit.

Years later she had a birthday party at her parents farm and I got absolutely blackout drunk. The look of disgust on her face is one of the few things I remember. I woke up in her pool house on a half inflated air mattress. No regrets. Fuck that bitch kek.

Well enjoy being borderline delusional. The woman in the OP was clearly not derisively laughing in his face or avoiding other kinds of physical intimacy, but keep theorizing.

watch the video, retard, she literally laughs at him. She's nervously propped up on her toes with her waste as far back as possible so she can hop off.

I bet he paid for this clip to "mog" his friends.

Retards.

Retard. This is how elementary school girls flirt. Yes it's retarded but all the popular dudes at my school would get hit in the balls by the popular girls constantly. I was insanely jealous because I'm a masochist and have always been super into ballbusting but no girls ever did it to me even tho it was an epidemic at my school because I was a weirdo/loner/loser. I'd even leave myself vulnerable with my legs wider than usual hoping they would take the bait but no girls ever did. Was truly a nightmare watching so many other dudes live my dream every day.
--- 73097306

I already watched the video and your perception of the events that transpired is delusional. You betting that he paid for the clip and calling me a retard means nothing. Relax, anon.

They literally live together. They're a couple. You think she is doing this ironically? If you're trolling you're doing a good job, if you truly believe what you're typing you're sick and probably beyond help.

I know, anon, did you miss the part where she is a turbo-autist?

>>73097268

Nta, but she's doing this disingenuously. She's a) virtue signaling how she's dating someone who's out of his league, and b) signaling for more attractive males to hit her up and compete for her
--- 73097387
>>73097373
>signaling for more attractive males to hit her up and compete for her

these autists wouldn't know what a genuine relationship looks like if they were in one. They have no reference point outside of anime.

This is so fake it hurts. I bet she is milking him for every dollar she can get. Woman are ruthless.
--- 73097405
>noooo its real and genuine and she loves him

ok, here's the secret bros. You know it's fake because she's pretending to be happy. People don't act like this IRL. kek

you will never have this because it isn't real. No one has this. Trust me bros, you don't even want this. Find a girl that respects space and boundaries. Fuck this clingy social media grubbing bullshit.
--- 73097445
>>73097405
this. also, dating girls that are social-media addicts is asking for heartbreak. if they crave attention and validation that badly then it'll literally take no effort for another guy to make her feel special.
--- 73097468
>>73094557 (OP)
Not only do they not believe it'll happen to them, half the people in this thread have gaslit themselves into believing it isn't even happening to the man in the video. This board really is pathetic. I can sympathize with a lot of the cope perspectives on here because I used to feel angry and rejected too but it's so gross to witness how aggressively a lot of these people don't want to get better.
--- 73097508

lol. anon we are speaking from experience. It's painfully obvious that you have had minimal interactions with human females outside of your family or professional relationships.

You know how you can "spot" an autist by the way they act and move? After a while you learn to recognize difffernet types of woman, as well. This bitch is a typical narcissistic social media addict, but she's also lazy and probably autistic, too.

She's too lazy to wash her hair (or her vag) so she cozies up to beta-chang till some slightly better opportunity comes knocking.

You haven't honestly deluded yourself into believing that this was her first choice? Or he has some kind of amazing personalty when he isn't eating dumplings and playing dota?

Grow up, retard.

listen here, chang, this thread is almost as pathetic as your little tiny chinese peepee.

True. It is a little saddening to see these people so convinced that OP's video is an impossibility, but there's nothing that can be done. Except another psyop, because they're clearly very susceptible to those.

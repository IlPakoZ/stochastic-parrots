lmao did you put stickers on your birthmarks so they don't get exposed to the sun

It's 10% appearance, 30% personality and 60% vibes.
If you have weak vibes, lack of presence, visibly no self-confidence... It's over.
"Self-improvement", "lookmaxxing" or whatever the fuck they call it now.... its main use was always to make you feel better about yourself. This guy, however, still looks like a little bitch desperately seeking validation from others.

how can you tell based off of appearance alone?

>>73083176
vibes is a work normies use as code for having game and looking good. there's no such thing. you can act like self confidence is what matters but you're lying.

>how can you tell based off of appearance alone?
It's something in the body language, the facial expression and the very fact he's photographing his abdomen for internet brownie points.

Isn't that kind of the point of a relationship, seeking validation from your partner

Yeah, some dermatologist somewhere along the way warned him that if those moles get sunburned they can turn into skin cancer.

Maybe his dad had some similar carcinomas or something. Skin cancer runs in my family, so if I ever got desperate enough about my appearance to risk trying tanning, I might do something like this. Unfortunately.

As a scrote you are born subhuman, you crave female affection and companionship, because human acceptance makes you part human as well, but in return for a woman's humanhood she loses some of her's on you, which is why body count matters.

 A dog or cat provides something fluffy to pet and hold can be trained to do various labours, and they have a much lower chance of causing violence or rape, so in return we feed them and love them. What does a subhuman moid provide a real human in return for their partial humanhood? The answer is "not enough" and women are waking up to this systemic injustice.

good to know that even if i become the gigachad i can't even dream of being then i'll still only be 40% of the way there
how am i supposed to get "better vibes," a "presence," and "visible self-confidence" when i don't even understand what makes for a GOOD PERSONALITY
--- 73084824
>>73084769
why don't women just date hot men with boring personalities? that way they won't get raped or whatever because the man simply isn't aggressive enough to do that, and incels win because self-improving is all they have to do
--- 73084911
>>73084824
There are no "hot" men. All men have the ability to rape.

What will you provide a real human for part of their humanhood?
--- 73084953
>>73084911
food, shelter, water, internet, rides, money, and sex if the women wants it are what are supposed to be provided. pets aren't supposed to give those so the comparison is odd
--- 73085016
>>73084953
All these things can be obtained by women on their own now, without risking rape and abuse of course.

Well, it's settled. No more retarded crybaby threads, no more stupid incel talking points. Find something to offer women, or fuck off.
--- 73085024
>>73085016
was i supposed to include looks, personality, or anything else subjective? because again you'll say that they're not good enough
--- 73085062
>>73085024
Modern moids aren't good enough, you are correct. That was my point. Stop making these threads now. Thanks.

Someone posting a picture of their toned body online isn't a sign of high confidence levels. This guy looks better than most people in this thread.

Did you enjoy making her feel good? The actually rewarding part of sex is the emotional satisfaction from making someone you feel affection towards feel nice, and that they like you and are enjoying making you feel nice too. Otherwise it's just masturbating using another person's body

oh yes that was an integral part of the experience. i would have absolutely hated it if she wasn't into it. i mean i'm now paranoid about her texting her friends "i hated it i was faking he fucking sucks"

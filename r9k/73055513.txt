Are white women overly paranoid? I saw some YouTubers reported on this woman in a parking garage that started yelling at some guy, "you do not approach women in parking lots!" I'm sure some have seen it.

Do they watch too much crime shit real or not?

This article I'm not even sure how it's news. Maybe something bad is going on maybe not but my BS detector started to register. Skimming the comments yeah a lot of almost this or that vs I was assaulted while out jogging in the middle of the day.

It was even suggested to not be afraid to yell at men that are following you. Like wouldn't that make the situation worse if something was going to happen. Start filming a real criminal and see what happens. Really starting to film escalates any confrontation. 

I understand safety and all this and bad things happen but the average man isn't some kind of rapist. 

It's almost like you could be caught up in paranoia and shitty advice you actually miss something that will actually happen. Human traffickers aren't snatching up 30 year old white women from Suburbia, USA.

A real predator isn't some guy on the jogging trail or at the gym. It's probably the handsome smooth talker at your job. 

Maybe there's better examples say dating articles but overall something makes me groan at all these male bashing articles. Like why, what's the point? I'm suspicious of something but not even sure what like it's obvious. There's no '10 shitty things women do on tinder' but stuff like that the other way, all day.

And maybe most people would dismiss me as an incel or something but I actually care about women, society, and this shit doesn't help anyone.

There are regularly posts here about following women at night for no reason

No they're just attention whores. Women's rights, social media, and Jews need to go extinct.

Victim mentality and as mentioned in your post when they end up with men who just turn out to be legit psychopaths so honestly I dont know what I can say is make sure to smile more because women dont like to see men happy

yes, true crime is pornography for foids, also women are just neurotic and paranoid naturally, rape lives rent free in their heads like trannies in a poltard's head.

sure, I admit that my heart rate increases ton any time I'm walking and I sense that there is a guy behind me. I feel like my politeness will be my end though, lmao. I always feel too insecure to even look behind because that might offend the guy.

and I mean when you're walking on a path with groceries, and a guy walks about 5 to 10 meters behind you, for several minutes.

Too much media and also narcissism.

Happens all the time to me. I find it kind of funny to just power walk at them and then snicker as a blow past them. They're terrified little creatures.
--- 73055613
>>73055522
Do you have a single peer-reviewed study to back that up?
--- 73055662
>>73055562
I appreciate a femanon response. I feel like maybe I was getting too aggressive in my opinion. Just sometimes it's like christ no one is raping you today. On the other hand maybe I'm a little naive to how creepy my counter parts are. 

The grocery store yeah, I feel weird if I cross the path of the same woman a few times like they are going to think I'm a creep. Maybe a sad world where everyone is worried about everyone being a weirdo. Like maybe I feel bad seeing someone walking from the store but offering a ride I'm like forget it.

yeah women are overly paranoid and their self worth is inflated by internet karma and upvotes/likes on tiktok

really no one is going to rape you, your pussy isnt worth a life time in jail

the only time its justified paranoia is in shit tier third world countries like ukraine and russia

I forget what the specific term is, but in evolutionary biology there is a bimodal classification for people that jump to hard conclusions without any evidence when presented with stimulus or a situation and people that investigate to see what the actual evidence points to. The first group had no downsides for being wrong in antiquity
>ooh i hear a rustle in those bushes, must be a cheetah so im running away!
If its not a cheetah, but a gust of wind, it doesnt matter. However if the second type of person is wrong
>hmmm a rustle in the bushes? I wonder what it may be, i should verify and see
And its a cheetah, theyre dead. The first group of people die less and propogate that mental form. Now that we are removed from many of these threats, the second group can form deeper knowledge of the world around us rather than accepting things at face value and building conclusions with no evidence, but the first type of person is still very prevalent and resists these things because it challenges their established paradigm. The lady in your OP seems to be from this group
>hmmm person behind me? MUST BE A STALKER THAT WANTS TO RAPE ME AND KILL ME AGGGHHH

Yeah I got you. I'm thinking it's a mix of that and the programming. 

It's like I can't be suspicious of 1 and 4 women in college get raped. I know it happens but that much no one would even go there, like it doesn't add up. Mixing up creepy looks, bad dates, and real assault doesn't help anything. 

I think some of this is the isolated lives we lead today, things seem more dangerous.

I wouldn't say so. You see how pajeets act around white women? I would be scared too.
--- 73056096
>>73056066
I should say its not just women that are primitive minded, its most men too. Just in this specific scenario im applying it to women even though it applies to both. As for the college rape thing, much is from drunken sex they regret, much is from pushy retard guys with women who are irrationally afraid of just saying no so they allow it but then later report it. No clue how much someone cornering a lone woman and pinning her down is, but it cant be that much i imagine
--- 73056353
I would not want to be a white woman especially a introverted one. 99% of men want to fuck you compared to 50-80% that ethnic women get

We are the most attractive race and we get kidnapped raped and murdered most often by strangers so yeah we have a right to be paranoid

And? Thats because men are primitive animals, basically rape apes. 

Keeping your guard up around a tiger in captivity doesnt make you primitive minded, its a logical reaction to dealing with a violent beast with little self control. Same applies to dealing with moids.

Would you start filming if you felt like a black man was following you?
That's what it feels like when women gets followed by strange men.
--- 73056663
>>73056557
why would I film a man who I think is following me? I'm not a woman.
The woman's natural response is to alert the hivemind and screech in her high pitch baby wail to attract a male protector, hence the filming
--- 73056756
>>73056557
I wouldn't start filming someone that I thought was a direct danger to me it would just agitate the situation. It's not a gun, they won't run away they would just go for the phone. Someone being nearby isn't a danger. Multiple blocks of being followed you have options. If someone was going to do something it'd happen so fast you can't pull out a phone or even see them until it's too late. 

I don't go around thinking the average black man is a danger to me. That's the Karen shit of calling the police for no reason, a black guy is just there. 

You can't go about your life with the world view that people not like you are likely the worst examples you see in the news.

Take the phone out and call 911 if it's that bad. Not sure why that advice wasn't in the article.

Used to do this until I did it accidentally with a black woman. I saw her reaching for her knife saying "you..." and I stopped doing this ever since

How often do you get new clothes bros?
I'm nearing 30 and I still wear most of the same clothes I wore in middle school. I patch them up whenever they rip. 
The only time I get new clothes is when my parents buy me socks and underwear for christmas.

Man, I can't even wear my high school clothes anymore because I'm a fat fuck. But yeah, I never buy clothes, I just wwar them until they completely fall apart. And I mean completely. A tshirt with ripped armpits is still good to go, at least around the house.

I get new shoes when my old ones get too worn out. For shirts I am like you OP I still have some stuff from middle school and I'm 28. But I buy new underwear and socks every year and I throw out old ones at the first signs of wear. Also I rotate stuff when it falls out of style like I got rid of my peacoat when the trend died out

Whenever I need to. Which is maybe once a year at most. 
My parents split when I was young and I would spend a week at one place then swap to the other, so I had two sets of clothes. After moving into my own place and combining both households stuff, I had a fuckload of clothes, so I just wear them until they got too many holes and toss them out. It's only now at 30+ that I've finally got to the point that it all fits in one set of drawers and anything thrown out needs replaced. 
>patching clothes
I've always thought I should, but I kind of needed to just throw shit out.

The people who can feed animals by hand are so gentle. I've never been able to do it.

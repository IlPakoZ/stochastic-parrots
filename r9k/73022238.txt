where do i hit with a syringe in a person's arm (or anywhere if possible) to get blood without causing air bubbles and without hitting veins?

Nigga, do you think you're just a walking bag of blood, like it's just freely sloshing around in there?

The way you wrote "a person's arm" instead of "my arm" is worrying. Who are you stabbing with a needle?

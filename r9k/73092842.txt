> Have good female friend, know her for a long time
> she breaks ups with her BF after graduating college
> needs to come back to town for a day and asks to sleep on my couch 
> she comes over and we hang out for a long time
> when It comes time to sleep I suggest my bed is a lot more comfy 
> she seems hesitant but agrees to sleep in my bed and cuddle, but with no sex
> we cuddle and she relaxes a lot, says she missed this kind of touch after she broke up
> we fall asleep and in the morning I make her breakfast before she leaves

Anons, now I can't stop thinking about her. The "affection hormone" they always talked about in school that gets released through physical touch is too powerful. She's said multiple times in the past that we are great friend but that she'd never date me (unprompted, I never suggested it)

What do???

Ask anyway. Don't be so serious about it, ask it casually. Like if you would be down to be more than friends or going out some day.

Literally you lose nothing for asking. Just don't go and make a ppt presentation of your feelings to her. Be short and if rejected be cool about it. If you think is awkward is gonna feel awkward

It's obvious she does not want you.

You've known her for a long time but she fucked some other guy in college.

She sees you as some completely asexual servant that she can sleep safely with.

You're horny and you're not thinking rationally. Save yourself heartache and ditch her for your own mental health.

best case scenario, she'll use him as a shoulder to cry on (dick to ride on). But he will know that he wasn't the first choice, he's just a temporary dick to release the pain.

If she just broke up with someone she's not gonna want to jump on you immediately unless she's made it clear she's had feelings for you before (which it sounds like she hasn't)

Just say something like "Not to be presumptuous, but if you ever need a moment like last night, my door's always open," it sounds just suggestive enough to get her mind going but also gets you closer to her more often. If you keep cuddling with her she might start falling for you on her own, then you can ask her out.

Girls literally do not agree to sleep in the same bed as men unless they want sex, excepting extremely abnormal situations where there's no other option.

You missed an opportunity OP, but, on the plus side, this means you're capable of getting chicks to want to have sex with you. Which means you're a failed normalfag and need to GTFO my board.

I'm going to try this sometime I think. We live in different cities now, but it's just an hour and a half away and she also happens to live in my home town now so I'll have a good excuse to hang out. The biggest problem right now is that I'm 99% sure one of our other mutual friends has a big crush on me, but I don't like her back, and it could make things weird.

I don't have trouble getting sex so it's perfectly fine with me. I've had a handful of hookups in the past, but cuddling with her felts so much better than all of those, because I already care about her a lot. She's also pretty religious so I didn't want to push too hard.

What do? You respect her boundaries and just forget that happened, duh

How can you lack such basic self-awareness?

It's so obvious that you only fuck ugly women. Now you're getting feelings for the only attractive woman in your life. If your sex life was so great, then you would literally not care.

holy JESUS

imagine just spoiled these foids are
seriously. imagine just how easy their lives are

they have simps that worship them for YEARS, and they know about it, all because of their genetalia

imagine if a girl did everything she could to win your love, impress you, try to get close to you, help you out whenever you have any issues, all because of your genetalia. and you reject her the entire time, and she still persists

there are girls who have men doing this for DECADES. its called "carrying the torch"

these men are so desperate for pussy that they simp for over a DECADE, for pussy they wish would be theirs. females do not do this to guys. females are not desperate for dick or male affection. they are cold and fine with being isolated. maybe some simp for giga-chad, like a famous musician, but thats it

its unreal how easy females have it
and its unreal how bad the simp epidemic has gotten

with things like twitch, onlyfans, findoms, etc, its NEVER been easier to be a simp, and many men spend hundreds if not thousand on women, for NOTHING

this affects women who arent even involved in those industries, because it sets the standards, and conditions men to be worthless ATM's and simps

But I've never simped for her before. We genuinely just been really good friends before. If anything she's done a lot for me in the past.

I still do. Nothing has changed.

I check in once every 3 days like I'm opening the fridge hoping that new food will be there.
It's still a travesty. Normies, e-girls, simps, trannies and rewordings of the same statements and phrases that prove the bot does fucking nothing.

It's absolutely boring. It's the same benign content 24/7 in an infinity loop.
They don't know why they're posting it. They don't know why they do anything. They're NPCs.

The most remarkable thing about it is that these rubes have managed to produce a worse board than a bunch of incels talking about how they can't get laid.

Same story.
The only thing that's changed is that I'm slightly closer to coming up with some grand scheme to exile these people out of this place and reclaim the holy land.

Quit procrastinating like a lazy loser and get to it. You can start with me. Exile me, big boy.

Robots, not incels. That's the difference. Incels devolve into sex obsession if the state of the board is any indication.

I hate to tell you this OP, but that's most of the site and the internet at large. All anyone cares about is sex and relationships. Even irl, everyone is just an unoriginal and uninteresting faggot on a repeat loop.

you couldn't even get laid by the time you were 16, nothing you ever threaten can ever be taken seriously.

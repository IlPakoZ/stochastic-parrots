I say a lot of silly things online that I wouldn't say in person. I am ashamed of this.

Asa enters a room with her arms crossed. She slides in sideways and takes a pose against the wall. She looks as though she is at a cocktail party where she would rather not be. However, if someone enters a room where she is already ensconced (against the wall with her arms crossed, or in her own office in her red chair, long feet on the second rung of her typewriter table), she becomes hospitable: she uncrosses her arms. If standing against the wall, she arches her back and presses her shoulders to the plaster. This movement opens her breast, which is reasonably bodacious, and outlines the flange of her ribs against her shirt.

Asa's tops are blue or white. Asa's eyes match her tops. On blue-top days her blue eyes beam reflected cobalt down paneled hallways; she has the smug aura of a beautiful woman. White shirts blank out her features so that her face is a white dish holding two dark marbles. On white-shirt days she is expressionless, a life-size photograph of herself snapped at a dull moment.

Maybe you should start visiting imageboards for something other than receiving attention.

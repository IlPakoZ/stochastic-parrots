all women have the same attraction triggers: tall and handsome.

his values are irrelevant. his behavior is irrelevant. his personality and status are irrelevant.
 
that's why he is still single at 40. he could be the most amazing man alive, it doesn't matter for genuine romantic love. tall and handsome is the only thing that can inspire genuine romantic love in a woman.

her "values" dont influence her decision making. she will choose tall handsome irreligious abusechad criminal pedophile over this guy in a heartbeat.

There was this girl who I used to talk to from r9k who told me that being personable, funny and a good provider is a lot more important than a man's looks and that ugly guys can find love. Do you guys think girls actually believe this deep down or at least some experience attraction differently?
--- 72983660

This chick is basically describing how men settle down but it's from the female POV

>>72983659
no, she was conflating relationships with love to avoid admitting the blackpill because women dont like feeling bad. 

if you haven't noticed, they will pretend their sexual arousal is a moral indicator. that's why pedochad abusers are just "misunderstood good men" and holy amazing men who are ugly are considered worthless.

women do not experience romantic love to ugly/short guys. they might use them for "relationships" where money/status (like starting a family when they realize chad wont give them one) etc are involved.

But you will never be romantically loved by a woman.

Your personality (personable, funny, provider, etc.) is completely irrelevant in attraction. Interest is not attraction.

They have no concept of "lying". They say whatever their audience wants to hear. You can't believe anything from them.
--- 72983722
>>72983659
no, interest is not attraction. relationships are not romantic love, especially older relationships. 

do her eyes light up on first seeing you before you talk? does she obsessively touch you, follow you around the first time you meet? no? then you're unloveable to women.
--- 72983735
>>72983659
They most likely do believe it but to varying degrees. To a certain extent looks don't matter as much. But looks 100% get your foot in to door, having an actual personality is what seals the deal. Looks get really fucking old when the person you're trying g to date has the personality equivalent to wet paper.
--- 72983746
>>72983735
looks are 100% of attraction. you are conflating interest, attraction, and relationships. 

personality has been found by all avenues of evidence to be irrelevant to women in attraction. simple as. there is no room for discussion on this fact.

looks are the determinant of womens long term happiness with men, all the evidence demonstrates this. also no room for discussion on this fact.

simple as.
--- 72983754
>>72983746
I am proof that looks are not 100%. Good looking by all accounts, but no bitches. The reason? I'm autistic and can't read and respond to social signals properly. That is simply a red flag to any woman who might be initially attracted to me

That's the thing, the halo effect is real. A chiseled tall chad making 50k is much more likely to be a "good provider" than the beta making 80k. He's also much more likely to be "personable and funny", because every shitty joke he cracks will make them laugh.

Nope, but what is true is a lot of women aren't complete horndogs like men are. So they might not notice they are physically attracted to a guy until he displays his personality a bit.
--- 72983837

you're not good looking retard. by definition if you are good looking women will straight up molest you and harass you.

--- 72983849
>>72983746
Yeah because interest and attraction are both incredibly important. I won't lie and say looks never matter but to say they're all that matters in the long run is just wrong. Interest and attraction are so closely tied together you need both to make a relationship work. You can cope and say it's only about looks ever but that's all you're doing, coping.

no interest and attraction are non-overlapping things. completely separate and unrelated.

attraction is instantaneous. its when she sees his height and face for the first time and her eyes light up and she feels butterflies and is aroused. that is what attraction is.

interest is cold and calculated. its when she sees his behavior over time, his income and career, his education, his values and family background, etc. and makes deliberate calculated cold life decisions based on it.

you can cope seethe mald dilate and sour grapes as much as you want, but you need to touch grass. simple as.
--- 72984134
>>72983825
no, this is nonsense. you are conflating attraction (looks based, leads to romantic love) with interest (non-looks based, leads to platonic or familial love).
--- 72984192
>>72983650
Can confirm.
I'm tall and handsome and I'm getting so many girls that don't even like my personality. Currently side-banging a girl 12 years younger than me that doesn't like a single thing about me; I'm simply tall and handsome.

I get attention, it just never goes beyond a first or second date. Like OK, sorry I haven't killed anyone or raped children or sold drugs. Guess I'll just die alone then. I'm physically and spiritually incapable or being antisocial. It's not exactly something you can fake either. Women are driven entirely by instinct and will accept nothing less than true, natural, raw, instinctual evil when looking for men. I truly wish I had committed horrible crimes sometimes because I'm so lonely. But lock 1000 children and nuns in cage, drench them in gasoline, hand me a zippo, and have a qt virgin Christian redhead watching. Even in a silver platter situation like that I'd still have a very hard time igniting it and killing the ones in the cage. I've done all the based Chad incelmaxxing redpill blackpill, clear pill, pillpill, and lookism shit. Got fillers for chin and jaw, abused steroids and performance enhancing drugs, literally a multimillonaire(crypto but it's still numbers), but I still don't have a beautiful wife. And I have tried. Asking in person. Discord. Tinder. Even bumble, plenty of fish, Oklahoma cupid, and farmersonly.com. If you are a good person, a real human, not antisocial cranked up to eleven rapist satanist terrorist, women will flat out ignore and ghost you to instead fuck the short guy selling fentanyl mixed with baking soda as molly.

They're really, really not. They're both intrinsically tied together. One can lead to the other and vice versa. They can fuel each other just as easily as they can kill the feeling entirely. There's a reason why a common piece of advice is to find new hobbies or to go to concerts/social events if you want to find a partner. It's not just because it puts you around more people, it's so you can be seen in an environment where you don't live and die 100% by looks. Seems like you could benefit from going out more too.
--- 72987124
>>72983659
i think they genuinely believe that to be the case. many women will have a guy that will go out of his way to help her with all of her troubles, just being a great, moral guy. they'll love him for this, but they forget that the reason they got with him in the first place was nothing but looks (100% looks, not even 1% personality). so they get offended when their fiery love for his character/soul/ whatever is reduced by some incel to be shallow. it's half true. either way, no woman's dating you if you don't have the right bones, so who cares about anything else i've written/

Good start. Get hobbies and do interesting things.

> I have tried. Asking in person. Discord. Tinder. Even bumble, plenty of fish, Oklahoma cupid, and farmersonly.com.

Chasing women like a faggot is bad. If you're a multimillionaire liquid, that puts you in a very small amount of people. You should be able to stand out and have something interesting about yourself.

I have had women give men their numbers and ask me out or even approach me at parties. A few times the mothers of women presented their 21 year old daughters to me.

It could be worse.
Even though I'm not handsome at all, I won't break any mirror and I'm fit. I'm not a Chad at all, but I've got some looks from girls at the beach, and it happened with coworkers as well. I've got a silver tongue and I'm knowledgeable on many topics so I can carry a conversation without any problem. At first glance you may thing that I could be a good book with an average cover, but that's not the case.
I simply cannot connect with people and I have zero empathy and, for the most part, zero interest in what they have to say.
Last time a girl from work asked me to go have a beer I dreaded the whole thing and I just wanted it to end so I could go home to read a book and listen to music.
Yeah, I got fit and worked on my hobbies, yet I cannot change my chore as a person. So I don't feel bad about not having a gf or meaningful relationships, I feel close to bad for not giving a fuck about them.

nope, you are trying to equivocate between men and women by suggesting we forget degrees and discrepancies. It is inherently dishonest to do this.

The only way to distinguish between two things in the same category ("people are shallow") is to be specific and measure by degrees, all else is dishonest and nihilistic. 

Any individual man finds 80% of women loveable and attractive, and its a different set of women for each man.

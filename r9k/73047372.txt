is it normal that my penis is like 1in while flaccid?

No. Kill yourself next time instead of bother real people with your "problems."

>>73047372 (OP)
I mean if its a normal size when hard then yeah? Some guys are growers it just how it be
--- 73047385

Yes, there are two types of penis: 'Growers' and 'showers'. Showers have penises near their erect size, barely getting bigger than their flaccid state. Growers will grow several times their flaccid state.

I don't care if it's a problem or not, it's bullshit and you wasted a perfectly good thread on it. Again, if you find it hard to post quality threads, just consider suicide instead posting on 4chan next time.

i'm barely 1in flaccid and 8 inches hard
--- 73047498
>>73047372 (OP)
Yeah, although mine is maybe not quite that small when flaccid.
It made me pretty upset when younger and when I went to a doctor's appointment and was asked to strip down I would intentionally stimulate my dick to get it filled with blood and normal sized looking.
And also I never once let a past girlfriend see me naked unless I was already erect before taking my pants off.

You know you're supposed to go to the emergency room if your erection lasts more than like an hour, right?

Don;'t worry, noose-chan catches up with every incel eventually. Only group more prone to suicide than trannies, I ironically.
>id consider it if i were a seething namefag tho
Just leave the seething and namefagging to me and focus on that noose, okay, big guy?

Believe it or not there were once good threads. And when all the incels and loveshys and autists and other people who can't fucking adapt but still want to compete have killed themselves, the world be a radically better places, and good threads will once again roam the boards. The younglings of that time will think of you guys as fairy tale monsters out of the annals of history, something that existed once but is now blissfully extinct.

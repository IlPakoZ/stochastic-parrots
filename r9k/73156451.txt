It's nice that my life isn't a constant quest for meaningless sex and I can focus on anything I want without getting distracted by porn and women. Honestly, you guys seem pretty miserable. Well it sucks to be you I guess.

I'm honestly curious, what is life like for you guys? When I see a person all my friends say are tentens I just see a person. Do you really just immediately imagine everyone of your preferred sex naked when you see them? And sit around by yourself obsessing over every little interaction and how it could lead to sex if you could just relive it? Isn't that exhausting?

I envy you guys sometimes.

There are downsides. Everyone assumes you're lying and when your other friends inevitably start talking about who and how they fucked it can get a little uncomfortable. But overall just seeing the time money and energy everyone spends just to wriggle around make a stupid face and brag about it makes me glad my brain is damaged this specific way.

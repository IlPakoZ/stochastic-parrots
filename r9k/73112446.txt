Fembots how do your feet smell? Be honest

Bumping for fembots feet

You make this thread once a day. Want me to just show you my soles already?
--- 73112562
>>73112537
I mean only if you want to. I don't want to like force anyone to do anything you know?

I make this thread because presumably the fembots that see it and would answer rotate though I'll admit the frequency is a bit into sad sack territory

Sometimes its me and not OP who makes the feet threads.
--- 73112679
>>73112537
yes. If Op wont say it I will

I don't mind rough soles desu

But those are cute!

Oh man the waitress anon with the chuck e cheese feet? You convinced me that I should look for women in professions where they are on their feet all day.

Cute toes and thanks for showing me the light on how to maybe get a smelly foot gf some day. I hope you find your massage giving bf like you wanted! I'd offer but I'm in the Midwest so I don't live near anyone.

Thanks! I got scared and deleted the pic but at least you got a quick peak.
--- 73112742
>>73112722
LOL yes I the owner of the chuck e cheese playground feet. Any woman who is moving around all day will sweat and get smelly feet, if anyone claims other wise their liars. Glad you got a quick peak as well, and thanks for finding my toes cute. Always thought I had nice nail beds.

For the record btw you probably could get like any guy normie or foot fag like me to rub your feet. I can't imagine it's a deal breaker for whatever guys out there. 

And yeah I just need to look for women with active jobs, makes sense. Though "hey I like that your feet smell awful" is a hard sell lol. Definitely have to treat it like I don't mind rather than it being a selling point.

You'd be surprised, there are a lot of people (men and women) who find feet inherently disgusting. Mex ex would move my legs off of him whenever I tried to rest them on top of him because of my feet lmao. Maybe just start with offering to run her feet and smelling from a bit of a distance before diving nose first into it.
--- 73112822
>>73112790
Lol that seems like an over exaggeration from your ex. I can't imagine they smell THAT bad.

And yeah easing into it is likely the plan. As much as I'd want to full on sniff my gfs feet you can't just go for it like that lol. Would freak even women who like foot stuff out probably.

The funny part is, this was when I was still mostly a NEET, so they wouldnt get that smelly or sweaty in the first place. He was dramatic about a lot of things. Sucks he was my only boyfriend though, at least at this point in my life. He left a sour taste in my mouth. 

Would you like if your gf gave you a pair of socks that she wore on a day where she was active and sweating a lot?
--- 73112907
>>73112865
Oh so if he was with you now he'd probably raise an even bigger fit lol. Maybe he just found feet gross, I don't understand it but some people are weird.

Yeah I love the idea of a girl giving me her sweaty socks. If I had a smelly foot gf I'd likely have to deal with her socks around the house anyway. If it was like we were dating and not living together and she gave me some nasty socks that would be awesome. I'd probably never ask for a pair though that would make me seem like a weirdo, unless she already knew

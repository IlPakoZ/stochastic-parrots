stacey means attractive female and all anime characters are drawn as perfect 10/10 people with no flaws so that is stacy yes

The stereotypical Stacy is blonde blue eyed young white girl, which is vaguely what she looks like, but she's an anime girl, so it's a weird comparison to make. Social hierarchy in Japan, and especially in anime, doesn't really work the same way as in the west.

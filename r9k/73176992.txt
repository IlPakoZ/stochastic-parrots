you do realize shes trans right? and trans women arent as judgemental as cis women right? you could really not respond for like 3 or 4 days and still probably get away with it if you make up a good enough excuse

i have such bad anxiety that i delete snapchat after sending a message, and usually dont redownload it for days unless i am drunk. And people still respond ot me

Literally a shot can take away some of my stress. That song's ok. I mostly listen to classical when Im really moody. I used to like all kinds of stuff, math rock and whatever.

iktf, thankfully I've only got drunk like 4 or 5 times since New Years this year, been almost a month since my last drink though, probably longest I've gone without alcohol in like 10 years
I don't tolerate hangovers as well as I used to and even if the drinking is somewhat entertaining for a few hours, I just don't like needing 2 or 3 days until I'm feeling better again

A loving dog helps me to feel better after a long day.

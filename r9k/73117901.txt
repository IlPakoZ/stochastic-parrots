Sure, but they're always 40+ couples where the woman is overweight and looks like a bitchy Karen. The men in these relationships are hypernormoid neurotypicals who came up in a completely different world.
Among younger couples? Ugly dudes never, fat dudes very rarely, and average guys sometimes, though always with women uglier than them.
Younger dudes need to be Bradlite or better to get a relationship, and the numbers reflect that.

Dating is primarily a function of getting out socially, not looks. It's kinda obvious if you think about it for a minute. Looks obviously help but they are not the main thing. It's the socializing that is really key.

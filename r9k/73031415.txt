To my fellow ameribots, i implore you to try flushable wet wipes. Eurobots and those with bidets need not apply, youre fine. But to my fellow ameribros, just try it. It will change your dookie game completely

Maybe if I lived in a house with PVC pipes (don't flush your wipes)

Just wet the toilet paper in the sink before wiping. I learned this like 10 years ago

I want to purchase a bidet for my bathroom. I used them everytime I was on the shitter whenever I visited Europe and it felt great. I just need to figure out how to install one before I buy.

Why not just shower after a poo? I'm not good at following routine but this way I get two or three showers a week.

EU wants yearly immigrant quotas for every nation. US wants 1 million plus immigrants. I don't think people realize the coming catastrophe that is coming to all the Western nations. Demographically speaking, if Western nations keep importing refugees and immigrants from the third world who are all uneducated, untrained, and completely oppose Western ideas and ideals to keep the ponsi system of a social safety net for old people and those that benefit now, they are knowingly or unknowingly reaping short term benefits for long term destruction. Under their logic, they are importing young people to work jobs that their own citizens won't do for half or more of the salary their willing to pay. Basically they need slaves to keep the system that they have set up running. But every historical instance of a rich nation or people basically importing or buying people to take jobs and fight wars for them has led to the end of that people. Take Rome for instance. Part of the reason Rome fell is because the citizens of Rome heavily relied on barbarians and slaves to do all the jobs and make up the military, and surprise, they turned around and ransacked and destroyed the place. Same thing is happening now.

People will point and say "look at the demographics, whites are 90% in England" or "whites are 70% in the US" etc etc. Yeah well those whites make up 95% of those over 60. Look at the schools for the future makeup of your society. 70%+ non-white, non-native. The UK has Indian leaders NOW. White women want non-whites NOW. Just wait 30 years. I think China and non-Western aligned nations, especially the Middle East and Africa, know that the West is in decline and will fall, even becoming African and Middle Eastern territories due to demographics.

What boggles me is that people happily and willingly advocate and promote this. Like, don't they see the problems that these policies create, or do they just want to see whites eradicated and Western nations looted and destroyed?

Immigrants will help us older folks retire and enjoy life. We knew a long time ago that young white kids are lazy and retarded. None of them want to work a real job, so immigrants are the solution. If I have to ill just move

The truth is that the west will soon resemble Brazil. A highly stratified society with a white elite.

Have you ever stopped to consider why, or imagine that perhaps there is a greater evil you are ignorant of?
If you're not a politician, you have a fraction of the information. don't act like you can see things they can't.

Most don't.

I do yes. I'm sorry but you really think society is going to look the same when everyone around you is recently from india? lol, good luck with that fantasy nigga.

The civilization we grew up in is becoming rarer and rarer, continually pushed into smaller towns. I plan on moving once the town I grew up in becomes unrecognizable, which is fast becoming the case.

Stop worrying so much about demographics and politics, go create your own kingdom and control some land like it's 1221. It's what smart people are doing right now. Create a clan.

they believe in the blank slate myth. That everyone is born equal and you can turn anyone into a productive citizen. That there are no behaviour genetic differences between the races. And that we can move past tribalism. In their mind, they can replace the natives and everything will look the same + ethnic food.

most people are capable of being good workers. why would anyone need to believe in this? it doesn't make any sense, just look at, like, all of history and how people have been made to work. force, power, money is all you need.

brown and black people have not show a capacity to create and maintain an industrial, scientific civilization. They can fill the low-iq jobs, sure, but in a multiracial, meritocratic system, they will always be at the bottom (except the rare genius here and there), and that causes resentment and the narrative that they are being exploited and oppressed. And you end up like South Africa. 
I want a functioning society where people don't see each other as enemies and vote for policies not skin colours. For that, we need separation.

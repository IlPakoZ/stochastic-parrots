Christ act as a human potential advocate in their mythology, he is a "be like this guy" symbol.
Fedoras like to frame it like a heaven or hell based morality but at the time the lessons cut through class division and promoted a kind of universal empathy. We can still learn from such lessons regardless of if you believe it all to be history or mythology.

The statement has nothing to do with the question. Ultimately Modern Atheists have a value and morality system principally derived from copying Christian morality. God is an anchor of that morality. A tradition of moral principles that has stood the test of time. Athiests copied all the right answers but have no anchor and so now they increasingly drift the overton window of their morality. Experimenting with "new", dysfunctional ways of living, and demonizing sustainable practices of life that effectively oppress the broader populace and require ever increasing institutional oversight to manage the constantly changing rough draft of their gay utopian vision with absolutely zero humanity left in it. 

It has nothing to do with threats. The question is, what is your morality really bound to and where can/is it going? The answer is rhetorical, the answer is anywhere and you have no fucking clue where it will shift to. Your system of morals is not a set of principles in a written word, but literally a high school clique replete with the same level of smarmy lowbrow shallowness children abuse eachother with, and nothing to trust or orient yourself with.

Homosexuality is bad because homosexuals frequently spread deadly pathogens with little care for others. Even to this day- with monkey pox it was seen as an absurd request to ask them to stop having sex with groups of strangers for a couple weeks to slow the spread. Keeping in mind that normal people were expected to give up their entire lives and stay in their houses for months because of covid but it is absurd to ask homosexuals to please stop having orgies with strangers for a while.

That's not morality, which is based on "good" vs "bad", and "right" vs "wrong", that's just material game theory, based on "beneficial" vs "detrimental" / "risky". It's not based on being good for the sake of "good", it's based on appeasing potential competitors to avoid conflict. Under such a material, purely utilitarian, view some rather horrible and immoral acts are justifiable, such as slavery. The question wouldn't be "Is slavery moral?" but "Can we prevent retribution?". That's not morality.

So? 
>no u 
lmao. YOU rejected a universal system of good and bad, and instead proposed an entirely subjective system of "pleasurable" or "painful". Universal good says that the ratio of pleasure to pain is completely irrelevant, his action is bad because it's bad. Your proposed "well personally I feel pleasure from it" system, does not.
--- 72998277
>>72998253
>So?
So the total pain outweighs the total pleasure, and thus serial killing is bad. No need to involve God.

Universal good says that the ratio of pleasure to pain is completely irrelevant, his action is bad because it's bad. Your proposed "well personally I feel pleasure from it" system, does not.
On what basis do you declare that something is "good" if not by virtue of the pain or pleasure it creates? Because you imagine God to like it or not like it? Such a system is equally subjective unless you claim to be God himself.

--- 72998556

There are three problems with your claim: 
1) Slavery remains "good", because if you have a couple slave owners and a single slave, then the pain of the slave is only 1/2 the pleasure given to his slavers. 
2) If the hypothetical serial killer kills his victims instantly, there's no pain or fear, so he's done nothing wrong. 
3) You have not provided a single reason to care about this ratio anyway. Your system is not based on any immutable, outside law, but on personal perspective. Pleasure and Pain are things we experience subjectively, therefore, we have no real reason to care about this ratio if we are not on the negative side of it. Hyenas don't, and if we lack a divine spark, we are nothing but clever hyenas. If, on the other hand, you propose some sort of metaphysical scale that must be balanced, sorta like Karma, then you have something, but as is, you have absolutely nothing. This is why you yourself reject "good" and "bad", "right" and "wrong", you know you have absolutely nothing to base it on. 
>On what basis do you declare that something is "good"
On the basis that God said it is. We experience morality in the first place because we possess his divine spark, it's up to us to embrace it. Simple as. Have a good day.

Funny you should mention that since the Bible endorses slavery.

Death robs them of all future pleasure, and thus creates pain equal to all the pleasure lost. Have some perspective.
>You have not provided a single reason to care about this ratio anyway
I don't want to be in pain. Do you? I also don't want other people to be in pain. Do you?

"Good person" just means "behavior that is conducive to the well-being of the greater social unit" 99% of the time. That's why basically every religion in every part of the world agrees on a general set of virtues and sins.

1. The atheists idea of being a good person is essentially just an absence of overtly negative attributes. If you're not racist or sexist or homophobic, you're a good person. Its jejune.

2. Atheism is basically hedonism with a mask. Because of this, their beliefs in subjective morality can easily be summed up as 'rules for thee, not for me.' Morals and laws and justice are extremely objective when someone else is doing it to you but when you are doing it to them the situation is more morally complex. 

I'd respect atheists if they just dropped all the bullshit, the pilpul, the mental gymnastics and word salads and just say "I dont want to believe in god because I want to play with my peepee all day". I'd respect them so much more.

"Just be a good person bro" is fine for stopping people from raping or murdering, but it doesn't help you when you have to argue the more tricky moral conundrums.
Questions like how the country should be run, or what our responsibilities to society are. These don't have obvious answers like murder and rape. These need to be argued. And when you don't believe in a supernatural objective moral standard that all humans are beholden to, then any argument you make is pretty weak. If everything is subjective, then why do I have to follow your moral opinions?

One of the most bizarre extremes of this I have ever seen was this atheist youtuber whatever who would always argue that morality was subjective, that there were no true values, and there never could be. Sure. Fine. Except this guy had a little problem. He just happened to be a vegan. According to veganism, eating meat is morally wrong and you have a moral duty to stop others from eating meat. So... he didn't believe in morals... but he also believed in this hyper-moralist worldview?
He could do the typical vegan thing of saying "Don't eat meat, it's wrong." But if he was consistent in his beliefs, he would essentially be saying "Excuse me. But evolution has given me the instinctual drive to empathize with other humans, and due to a quirk in my personal behavioral development, this instinct has been inappropriately extended to other species. This has resulted in me personally not liking the idea of the consumption of meat, so I will have to ask you not to enjoy that double bacon cheeseburger."
To which I can reply
"Lol. Okay." And eat it anyway.
I will still think of myself as a good person after eating that burger. The majority of humanity will agree with me. And I won't be breaking any eternal moral laws, so... why shouldn't I?

The average person's conception of morality is just "what the majority believes" or "what people who are winning and have power say to do." You don't need to have religion to be moral, in fact the majority of religious people abide by the above which is why Christians change their stance on important issues and the interpretation of their holy book so often. Real morality is instilled by nature, people don't want to hurt each other too much or get hurt in turn. It would lessen the chances of survival for the group because people can't survive on their own. That's what makes the grinding tedium, rudeness, and aloneness of today so painful, people are not meant to live like this.

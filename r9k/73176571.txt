Alright faggot I'll help you out anyways.
Play it cool. Women are like cats. They come on to you.
Your confidence doesn't mean shit to them.

I noticed this once too during my last job. Guess women are turned off by me being approachable because it means I'm alone? I don't know man

I'll get boo'd off the way I did a week or two ago because apparently not being a "robot" or one of you idiots means I'm not supposed to come here and try to help you guys but I'll try again.

These are good signs that you're naturally and at least some level conventionally attractive. The next step is just repetition. My advice is to make it a goal to approach a cute girl whenever you see one that catches your eye in public and you don't think it's too much of a stretch and try chatting her up. Tell her you don't want to bother her but that you just wanted to let her know she was really pretty or has really pretty hair, eyes, etc... If you're confident and the attraction is mutual depending on her response you'll be able to tell if she wants to talk to you. Be realistic, but also you'd be surprised. Girls get this less often than you'd think, and if you're genuinely attractive it's even better because they love confidence and having their egos stroked so it's a two for one. If you can hold the conversation and you are good at asking her about herself and getting her to talk you'll be fine. Don't talk too much about yourself, girls want to talk. If she's asking you for your name she's interested. Sometimes this won't go beyond anything but the conversation itself and that's fine. It's just practice, but like anything you get better over time. The goal is to expose yourself to the situation enough times that you stop worrying so much about the outcome or the nerves of it all. If you can talk to a girl and make conversation in public like that and get her comfortable enough to start telling you about herself you're lightyears ahead of other guys.

yes ram is cute
>>73176717
I got two cats and can confirm this is NOT true. I regularly just approach them randomly and play with them and they love it
>>73176736
nothing gay about a man loving women
>>73176814
real as fuck. I think it's some weird stone age instinct where they like a man that's busy, because said man has something ongoing in his life and thus has something going for himself

God bless you Anon and I will try this the next time I get the opportunity. It's just this one life that I have, it's worth the shot

You're an autistic fuck who isn't a robot, so your opinions on cats don't matter as you're also inexperienced entirely with felines to think domesticated cats you've acclimated to your presence isn't part of standard relationship development.
Fucking faggot.

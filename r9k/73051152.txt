Good "girl", you should dilate more often and it won't happen.

I am not retarded but I have so many mental illnesses that I might as well be. 

>>73051176
I still have my dick though

Is that your fetish or something? If not, then what makes you incontinent or are you just incontinent with no other disorder/disease giving you that as a symptom?

I failed last night too.

No. Despite keeping my dick, less tesosterone means a smaller, weaker prostate that has smaller, weaker muscles around it. So it makes your pelvic floor weaker which makes it more likely you pee yourself. That's why you see so many posts about diaper trannies and stuff I think.

I thought the diaper tranny stuff was just a comorbid fetish thing with submissive people. Don't tell me you wear diapers, OP?

>>73051722
It's both. You either 
>troon out and then have bladder issues from spiro/hormones and then end up falling into the diaper tranny meme
or
>diaper fetishist troons out and doesn't hide it because trannies need to be somewhat shameless to survive
I wear diapers, yes.

You have my sympathies. I imagine you could probably do kegels to fix your incontinence though.
--- 73051763
>>73051749
I already do kegals, so maybe it's just made it not get worse. Diaps are fine even if it makes me disgusting and weird. Better than being a tranny who doesn't transition.

Might be worth looking into specific kegel exercises that help with incontinence. How long have you been doing them anyway and how long have you been on HRT?

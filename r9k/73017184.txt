Remember husky StarCraft from back in the day?
Well guess he got together with a goblina and became her Manager who had a way larger channel than himself

Moral of the story is everyone is more successful than me, even nerds who played the same game as me ages ago, damn, time flies, didn't remember him being that old too, time flies indeed 

Just some shit from my YouTube feed that made me feel old as fuck, remember that chink HDStarcraft? Or whatever
Damn
I need money

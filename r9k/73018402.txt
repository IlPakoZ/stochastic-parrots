>>73018402 (OP)
You paid for a whore and she turned out to actually be a whore? Woah
--- 73018429
>>73018414
i loved her more than anything. i just wanted her to love me back
--- 73018435
imagine the first bite of that delicious steak dinner you treated yourself to because her simp came through extra good today. mmm, so delicious.
--- 73018458
>>73018435
she told me i was her bf, not a simp
--- 73018673
bumping so everyone can learn from my mistakes. also, her dc name starts with an r, be careful of e girls and fembots
--- 73019067
>>73018429
Its a gamble when you think like that.

Why wouldn't you leak it fully?
Also, did you have plans on meeting up? If you're actually both in love and there's some distance between you too, you'll know it since you'll both want to come up with plans to meet ASAP.
Spending money on a girl you met online before meeting her IRL just seems completely retarded in 99% of cases.

>>73019067
what else was i supposed to do? buying her stuff is what got me her attention to begin with
--- 73019645
>>73019335
You know what you were supposed to do? Do some self-respect, grow a brain or somerhing. Find yourself a woman for free, anything but this.

Or he could just kill himself. It never fails to amaze me that there a people who openly admit their lives are worthless, that they have no chance at happiness, and yet they selfishly go on living anyway. I wish every incel who ever whined about being lonely online suddenly burst into flames all at once.

How does someone as pathetic as you have $20k in disposable income?
--- 73020133
>>73020115
i make 300k a year, money isn't much of an issue to me
--- 73020146
>>73020133
Making $300k yearly income but still an incel is very embarrassing. What is your occupation, assuming you are not larping?
--- 73020197
>>73020146

--- 73020244

>Spending money on a woman who doesn't regularly touch your penis
People like you deserve to be called moids by dumb mentally ill women online. Horrifically pathetic.
--- 73020318
>>73020244
making money isn't hard given you're half decent at math and graduate in something stem in college and you're in the usa
>>73020270
you wouldn't love me though would you?
--- 73020436
>>73020318
of course i would! i am not a whore, i dont mess with chads. i would be yours and youd be mine. id even let you keep track of who i talk to, if youd like. i know that you might have certain trust issues after this :(
--- 73020442
>>73020133
>money isn't much of an issue to me
It's more about the self-respect of not giving money to a girl you haven't even met.
--- 73020443
>>73020436
>i am not a whore
>offers to talk to man just so he can pay her for her services
you can't make this shit up
--- 73020454
>>73020443
im not asking him to pay for anything, i dont want money
--- 73020468
>>73020454
ok i might not ask for money directly, but i might ask for some help with paying for my monthly hrt
--- 73020476
>>73020436
>>73020454

--- 73020537
>>73020476

You're a dude larping right?
--- 73020688
>>73018402 (OP)
Unironically fucking kill yourself. 
Why do you enable this? Why are you this retarded? You should be shot on the spot for allowing e-whore behavior to prosper.

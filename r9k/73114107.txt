I just wanna tomboy gf without the delusional mental illness

>>73114262
that's an oxymoron. A girl has to be mentally, or at least socially abnormal to make herself look like a sporty boy

>>73114434
We could be socially abnormal together

FtMs are arguably more pathetic than troons. Imagine transitioning to a "man" and being a weak short manlet with no dick. Wtf is the point of that?

I already have myself to be abnormal with. There isn't a place for the three of us.

She's insecure about not being a traditionally pretty and feminine girl so she thinks the "boy" thing is a way to "opt out" of being judged as one. I think it's so cowardly and pathetic. Also insulting to other women that don't buy into that shit. It's nlogism to the max

Even if I were to become rich I wouldn't want anything to do with any woman who showed interest in me while knowing that I was rich.

no its not

its refusing to acknowledge how the real world works - which is, people threat you differently when youre high status 

ie. every celebrity out there is nothing without their status backing them up

You're talking about glorified prostitution here lol. There are dudes IRL who can get some of the hottest women in the world through looks and charisma despite having zilch for status. Buying women is not even on the same planet as that.

no, im saying stardom, regardless of your deteriorating looks, gets you special treatment

also, having charisma, with nothing to back it up, can only get you so far. people will eventually wise up to you being a phony 

having all the charisma in the world will not get you a free car. you maybe able to dupe a dumbass out of a couple 100 bucks but you will not sustain a living off it

maybe you should think about what is actually valuable. i'm sure you wouldn't be striving for this if you did.

I could have been getting rich instead of wagecucking?
Shit.
I've been doing it wrong the whole time. I feel stupid.

Well, I'm rich now, but I have a huge problem.
No matter how I cater myself to beautiful women, it feels more like they cater themselves to me. No matter what I do.

Oh well. Mo money, mo... wait. Hold on. Mo money, no real problems actually.
Huh.
I should have got rich years ago.

Thanks anon!

Because everyone including me is trying to be rich, but most including me fail. If I was successful I would not be here.

If I was rich I would hire some sort of desperatee, low-class, ugly whore as my sexmaid and have fun shaping her body to perfection, making her workout each day, all while keeping her face ugly. AMA!

My mom's always been crazy. As a kid I used to be deathly afraid of her. She'd inflict these weird fucked up punishments on me and my brothers, I think she was just taking out her frustrations on us. But then after she finished beating our ass, we were supposed to come hug her and sit with her and she'd stroke my hair and it was so fucking uncomfortable. Eventually she just stopped doing that and life got better.
I figured my mom was just psychotic and that was that for years.. but I'd always had strange suspicions about her. Well last night I got very fucking high on LSD, and I won't bother trying to put into words the clusterfuck of an experience it was for me, but I really think my mom molested me. I really think I just remembered it.
I can see it so clearly, in my memory, it felt more like a dream. But I know it was real. It really happened. I was sitting in a chair, and my mom kept touching me between my legs. I tried pushing her arm away, and she was crying as she forced herself on me. It was so suffocating, I woke up in a cold sweat. It wasn't just the dream, so many other memories and details were just suddenly connected in my mind. I'm positive that this happened, and I think she molested my brothers too.
I don't know what I should do, if anything. No way I could confront her about it. Maybe I should talk to my brothers about it.

>I think my mom molested me
That's crazy and I'm happy that happened to you or sorry it did but I'm not reading all that

She definitely still yelled at me quite a bit. I don't even really remember most of the molestation, but I can recall hundreds of instances of shouting matches and being yanked around by my arm, getting slapped and having my face grabbed. I used to really think my mom hated me. Not very hot, anon.

my bad
i hope you get to come to terms with what happened to you and get to heal. i dont think i really believe in healing though, just managing to cope more with the passage of time. also my parents sucked and gave me issues for life myself so i didnt mean to be an ass, i can understand

It's not a big deal, anon. I just didn't want people to get the wrong idea. I don't think sexual abuse is very hot, and I think that's a commonly held opinion on this board. I mean there's usually at least one incest board up.

I wonder what her reason for crying while doing that was. Sounds kinda strange. you think she felt bad ?

She was probably crying because he was trying to stop her from playing with his dick so she tried to cry to manipulate him into thinking he was the one in the wrong for not letting his mommy ride her sons penis.
Women are weird like that.

I think she felt bad about her urge for whatever reason. Shits wild regardless.

Stay strong anon think about your next moves.
and dont let what happened to you define who you are.

Pretty sure I'm repressing memories of my abusive mother molesting me also....

Women dont feel bad about stuff they lack the brain power for real empathy.
I think she was just crying because she was mad her son was pushing her away when she wanted to have sex right now.
Also im not OP.

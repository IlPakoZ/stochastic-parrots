If we're really headed into the singularity, a robot girlfriend will seem like a quaint wish. Imagine taking a pill and fixing all your genetic deficiencies, and/or growing a biological flesh and blood replicant girlfriend, and/or plugging your brain in directly into a matrix world where you can have infinite girlfriends. It sounds crazy but it could all be possible

Ai in its current form, is like a child copying from adults. 
If it bevomes more advanced it will replicate real foid behaviour and reject you 100%

Dearest Robots; please answer my sexually charged survey. Your answers are going towards a good cause!

If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?

What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.

Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?

Please be as descriptive as possible. There are curious minds which value your words.

First thing I'd do is cuddle

>>72968032 (OP)
I'd fuck her with lots of kissing
tall women are hot (think 5'9-5'11)
I don't watch porn, sadly I'm seeing a lot of that on this site, I might need to stop using it again like I did for the past 8 months

>>72968032 (OP)
heres your datamined stats
>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
Since this is sexual I think I'd start off by eating her out while simultaneously caressing her breast/nipple area. Then I'd go through with the normal stages of sex, penetration, ejaculation, etc.
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
I'll give you both a physical feature and an action, a physical feature I find really hot are wide hips, generally a decently sized lower body. I don't know why but I also like athletic girls in a way, I remember smelling literal girlsweat of a classmate when I was younger and it reminded me of sex at the time.
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
Almost always Xvideos, Nhentai, and Hanime.tv. I usually like to watch/read very tame vanilla stuff with small fetishes squeezed in there at times.
picrel is just there for fun, thanks for letting me think about some stuff for once on a weekend
--- 72968149
>>72968032 (OP)
>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
First time I meet them, I'd want to take it slow, intimate, more loving, cuddling, really form a connection with them. After that, I'd want to indulge in them like they're the finest wine and I'm a sommelier. Oral, anal, foreplay, see how many different positions we can work in until we find the perfect one. I wouldn't be able to resist them. I'd even want to have sex with them while they're sleeping, knowing they'd be willing to give themselves to me any time of the day.
>What minor feature or action drives you wild?
I love women with glasses. I don't know why, something about it makes me really attracted to them.
>Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
I'm not a huge fan of the sex industry. I mostly consume hentai, read doujins, but I like the emotional aspects of porn as much as the physical aspects. Sometimes I go on AO3 and read written erotica, where you can really get into the characters mindspace, understand exactly what they're feeling, why the sex matters to them, every little thought they have while fucking their partner, which is something you can't get in a visual medium like regular porn.

>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
 cuddle and go to sleep together
I think it'd feel great to know that somebody accepts me and wants to be close to me 
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
I don't have anything like that
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
I go to places like rule34.xxx and other booru's because they have a lot of stuff that satisfy my wide range of preferences

--- 72968205
>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
Everything and anything I can think of. Her tongue will be in my ass, I will piss on her, I will fuck every whole, slap her, kiss her. I would make her send me videos flashing in public, I would make her sit on my face. I'm not really picky. Anything I think sounds fun basically. 

>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
I love short girls. They are so cute and makes me wanna carry them around and hold them down while I kiss them. I also love jeans, they are super hot to me. I don't really know why

>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
I try to avoid porn. It rots your brain and makes me feel bad. Some reddit NSFW can be fun though.

>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
Women acting shy or being socially awkward, afros, very dark skin, being so skinny your ribcage shows through, having abs, having a flat tummy, having a slightly pudgy tummy like not fat just that small tummy some women have naturally, being very giggly, nice armpits, landing strips/triangle pubes.
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
I used to go to gif or nhentai, sometimes imagefap. I stopped watching porn because I feel like it was damaging my mind, so now I either jerk off while I imagine having sex on my honeymoon or I google "sexy black woman bikini" and jerk off to pictures that come up.

That's a very considerate answer, Anon! I hope you find a girl who enjoys gentle intimacy like you do.

>>72968101
Did you develop a taste in taller women from experience? Did you actively choose to avoid porn, ala 'no fap', or is it a personal choice divorced from any type of movement?

>>72968137
When you say wide hips, are you more referring to the typical hourglass body shape or are you also partial to the pear body shape? You may need to look up these terms, but I'm not certain there are well done visual examples.
I'm glad this thread helped you take your mind off of things! That's what it's here for!
>>72968167
You're very welcome! Do you have these positional preferences from experience or conceptualization?

>>72968149
My goodness, somnophilia is a rather unusual fetish! Did you discover it through a personal experience, or was it all introduced through intentionally erotic media?
Glasses, huh? It seems like that would be unusual, but I don't know for certain. I've always thought men disliked glasses as a rule.
AO3 is a good erotica website!

>>72968161
Hello! :D
Boorus have always disappointed me. I think I prefer some level of prolonged consistency; changing artstyles disorients me when masturbating, which is why I prefer to choose one artist at a time, stick to a single doujin, or things of that sort.

>>72968169
The 'under desk gaming assistant' seems to be a rising fetish in the newest generation; I wonder how mainstream it will become over the years.

>>72968187
Straight to the point I see. What about glasses entices you?

--- 72968310
>>72968270
>somnophilia is a rather unusual fetish! Did you discover it through a personal experience, or was it all introduced through intentionally erotic media?
It was through porn, I'm not getting laid anytime soon. It's like a consensual rape thing, I don't have her consent, but she'd let me do it whenever I want that I explicitly already have her consent to do it whatever. That kind of thing is hot to me.

Glasses came from real life. I don't know when it came about but at some point I realized that every girl I was interested in had glasses on, until it reached a point that only girls with glasses were cute to me.
--- 72968321
>>72968270

 body hair is hot (on girls)

>changing artstyles disorients
that's interesting
I think I prefer the changing art styles because the stuff I masturbate to is also inconsistent
--- 72968336

nta I think it's because you can buy sex but genuine loving cuddles are unattainable for most of us

I don't know, I'm 6' myself, but women who are that model height (about 5'9-5'11), I just find that hot
before coming back to this site I was largely porn free since I last browsed here in August

When she has your back. When you know she respects and admires you. It makes her worth literally defending her with your life
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
Don't watch porn. If I have to I will use my imagination. Porn desensitises you. When you stop watching it, you can appreciate the subtle things about women more
--- 72968381
>>72968336
yeah this is my thing with eating a girl out, I'd love to, but I need a woman who actually wants me lol
I've had sex via prostitution, but I don't think I'd go down on one unless she was really able to convince me that she's into me, I also wouldn't ask for a blowjob unless I thought this as well

Well it sounds less like 'non consensual' and more like an agreement to remove personal boundaries, which I can definitely agree is potently erotic!

>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
I'm a raging submissive so my default tendency is to ask what she wants lol. I guess if I had to choose myself I'd just lick her pussy.
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
I had to think about this one. Maybe dance related things like if she does a pirouette. I don't know if this is really 'minor,' as it is a fairly noticeable thing if someone chooses to do full dance steps in public, but it's all I got.
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
Sort of. I do not watch porn. I look at erotic media of partially-clothed women. In particular I have a massive ballerina fetish and when indulging in this fetish I will watch full ballets on Youtube. I don't mean like ballet porn, I mean I'll literally throw on a full professional production of Swan Lake or Giselle or whatever and use that as erotic media. I genuinely find it 10 times more arousing than any porn.
--- 72968417
>>72968032 (OP)
I want to hold her tight in my embrace and whisper every loving thought that her touch and scent bring out in me, to rock her side to side and clasp her hand in mine, to break apart and bring my hand to cup her face and kiss her deeply. 

I've so much love to give and no outlet for it but my dreams.

>>72968406
I hope so, thank you for the nice words

>>72968408
>Body hair? You like body hair now?
of course! I think it's because body hair on a girl is pretty rare, I've never seen a girl with hairy armpits or legs or a happy trail 
Also the idea of a girl being so comfortable around me the she doesn't feel ashamed about not shaving because she knows I'd like her regardless, is cute
--- 72968462
>>72968032 (OP)
>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
Touch her hand, her face, maybe her boobs and butt too. Not sex though cuz I only want to have sex with someone I love.
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
It's as physical as it is mental, but it is the girl having an athletic body. It's hot to me not only because it looks good (as long as you don't overdo it by taking steroids and only working out to bodybuild), but also because it shows that the person is disciplined and hardworking, someone that is more active than passive.
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
Just the usual porn websites. I like fit girls but not the bodybuilding muscular kind, and I also am not into being dommed, so it wouldn't make sense for me to go to those websites which I know exist because those are usually the ones that are suggested to me.

if i could do anything to a girl i'd forcefully feed her earthworms. im sorry but thats literally what i would do. i like short girls with big tits and long hair that you can pull. i'd fuck her really hard after the earthworm thing but if i had to choose just 1 thing it'd just be the worms because im really desperate to do this to someone

>When you say wide hips, are you more referring to the typical hourglass body shape or are you also partial to the pear body shape?
looked them up, and yeah both of them are pretty hot
i'll list down a few other things i find hot since im wide and awake now:
glasses, breasts (literally just in general i like small and big breasts etc.), beauty mark moles specifically a tad bit under the eye or under the edge of each lips (yes 2b got me into that feature), I have a thing for women who are independent, basically can take care of themselves. At the same time I like the contrast of the girl whos sort of dependent on her boyfriend. This applies to both, but I'd say being very touchy and romantic to their partner is something I find hot too (I'm very touchy myself when it comes to affection). This is really just extra but a woman who shares my music taste would be nice (I like stuff like Cryptopsy, Entombed, Dismember, Cannibal Corpse, Carpathian Forest, Mayhem, Suicidal Tendencies, and Morbid Angel). 
it'd be kinda cute to wear matching band t-shirts lol, picrel added for more shits and giggles

>I'm sorry to say, the idea of a man googling 'sexy black woman bikini' is too silly for me to pretend otherwise. It feels like quite the thing a middleschooler would do!
That is exactly what I used to do as a kid yeah. I would go on youtube and search for erotica and watch a slideshow of women in lingerie. I'm trying to cut porn out completely but I don't want to stop jerking off completely because that can lead to erectile dysfunction, but so can watching too much porn. So yeah I just stick to softcore porn and the easiest way to find that is to just google "sexy black woman" or whatever type of woman I want to jerk off to that day.
I find that treating yourself like you are your own parent is sometimes the best option to stay healthy.
Kind of like
>Would I want my kid to stay up till 4 in the morning.
No probably not.
>Would I want my kid to sit in his computer all day while eating junk food?
Definitely not.

No.

Probably.

>What do you think led you to become submissive?
Well my first girlfriend was dominant and I think that kinda set the tone for my later preferences. I think though that maybe some kernal of submissive sexuality was already there, I was already pretty passive in everyday life before I started dating.

>>72968461
Well, in that case, are you actually attracted to bodyhair or just what it represents?

>>72968462
I cannot lie, I'm becoming just a bit frustrated. You say touch; how? Are you just going to run your hands over her skin, are you going to squeeze? Are you light or applying pressure? I want to know every detail you can imagine.
It seems athletic women are becoming more popular in recent times, which I think makes sense, as the average fitness of people at large goes down over time.

>>72968466
Somnophilia again, huh? You'd like that, despite her giving you no response? That's very interesting to me. I feel like it's a fetish that has more appeal for women than men, but I've never been too understanding of men's desires in the first place.

>>72968491
Earthworms? That's incredibly bizarre. How did this desire even originate?

>>72968495
That's what I'd assumed as well. I imagine it would be a more enjoyable combination for atmospheric games. Minecraft seems to fit the bill? I'm not a 'gamer'.

>>72968512
Ahaha, why would you even assume I'm a woman? That's preposterous. It would be deeply shameful if a woman just enjoyed talking to men about their sexual urges and desired, that would be rather pathetic, if I do say so myself. If I were a woman, being that brazen would kill me!

Conceptualization, I'm still a virgin because I worked hard to get into the college I am in now, and I lived in a small suburban town with a large high school where most of my friends lived in a few towns away. I'd say the only reason I imagine these things is because I'm very high in sex drive, I try to avoid porn overall, but at the same time I can't last more than 3 days without relieving myself.

>You say touch; how? Are you just going to run your hands over her skin, are you going to squeeze? Are you light or applying pressure? I want to know every detail you can imagine.
Right, my bad. I think it'd be a bit of everything, because I'd be doing that because of my scientific curiosity. I'd run my hand over her skin to start with, just to feel the texture of the outer most layer. I'd also give them light squeezes and maybe a few harder squeezes, as well as trying to pinch them out to see how bouncy it is. Now that I think of it, I want to lick her arms, legs, face, and neck too. No specific pattern, again just to see what it's like. Not gonna do it to the armpits unfortunately lol. After I'm done I guess I'll just cuddle with her.
>It seems athletic women are becoming more popular in recent times, which I think makes sense, as the average fitness of people at large goes down over time.
Nowhere near popular enough. My looksmatch would be at least a Stacy-lite just because of her being athletic.

the desire originated from the how eat fried worms movie i saw as a kid. girls find worms gross and seeing a girl in fear and disgust of having a cold wet slimy one in her mouth arouses me and makes me cum bucket loads. i get aroused when i watch fearfactor and the contestants have to eat gross stuff
--- 72968800
>>72968032 (OP)
If she was bound and completely at my mercy? I would lick and kiss all over her body along with some tickling, get off to it, then eat her out because I've never had the chance to.

Although this is more romantic than sexual, smiling. Seeing a woman grin at seeing me when I don't know them completely captures my attention, because as someone often insecure, it's never something that I expect to happen. For something more sexual, formal wear that "covers" the legs but still shows them off is insanely captivating, like suit pants as opposed to skirts.

I check a bunch of places at once, but boorus are one of the best to find something to turn me on. Tags and all. It changes from there depending if I want to finish while seeing a video or a picture.

I would hold her in my arms and stroke her hair for hours. I would kiss her very sloppily with my tongue in her mouth and saliva everywhere. I would lick and suck on her nipples. I would have her sit on my lap while I finger her pussy, kiss her neck, and whisper into her ear. I would fuck her pussy in basically every position, mostly favoring doggy style and pronebone. I wouldn't do anything to her anus. I would make her lay on her back on a bed with her head hanging off the edge so I could fuck her throat and watch her neck bulge, and this would be the best part of it all.
>What minor feature or action drives you wild?
Brown hair, ponytails, messy bob cuts, chokers, skirts, glossy pink lips, somewhat large european/asian lips, perfect straight teeth, thin necks, thick transparent saliva/mucus, squishy wet sounds associated with the mouth/throat/saliva, the visuals of the way a woman's neck moves when she swallows something, the sound of a woman swallowing something, a woman talking about her throat in any context, wide hips, thick thighs, big fat natural ass
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
Not really, but some of the media itself may come across as unusual. I can cum in like 2 minutes watching and listening to a youtube video of a woman drinking water. Most of what I masturbate to comes from gelbooru, /gif/, redgifs, pornhub, youtube, and the audio porn thread on /t/

>despite her giving you no response?
It feel pretty damn awesome to receive that sort of trust from a girl for one thing. Then there is also the lure of a taboo of being able to do whatever you want to someone who is fully helpless, maybe even more so than in most bondage games. In addition its is very intimate thing, being able to silently observe her every reaction unfiltered and unguarded by conscious hang-ups or worries of judgement.

>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
To? Make her want to cry with joy. I think that would be the most fulfilling thing that I could do. Tickling them until they cry might be fun too. If we're talking strictly sexual... I think thighjobs are pretty hot. Intercrural... Lapdance.... Mutual masturbation... depends on the mood?
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
Playful teasing for sure. When they let their hair down...
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
I wouldn't say so. Usually the regular video sources but I guess I'm into some more obscure and specific things mostly focusing on the temptation aspect and the mutual erosion of resistance in a non-manipulative way. Literotica tends to be better for that sort of thing though. I've been trying to get away more from the visual stuff because I have observed a difference in my physical reaction and recovery versus other forms of media or thereinlackof.

>>72968913
Fine! Sheesh!
>>72968888
I admit, I do. This is a deeply rooted fetish for me. I was raised catholic; I've been sexually overactive since elementary school. I've been confessing to sexually inappropriate behavior to priests since I was young... or, you could consider it talking about masturbation in an anonymous setting. My local priest was somewhat inappropriate, so he often asked me details. This is something I've been aroused by for decades.

>>72968909
Well, putting aside the homicide, your fantasy is detailed so gratuitously, and with such fierceness. Sloppy kisses... a personal favorite. Hypothetically, unfortunately.

>>72968949
I've always wondered if, in a somnophilial encounter, the sleeping woman would have erotic dreams as the event occurred. I think that would be add a very psychologically arousing level if it were true. You not only get to do what you wish with her body, but on another level, you're doing what you want to her mind as well.

>>72968032 (OP)
I keep reclicking on this thread even though I gave an answer (first somno guy) because the chick in the OP is hot, so here's some more stuff I find erotic.

>Rough Sex
The idea of completely losing all inhibitions and unleashing my carnal desires like an animal in heat is appealing
>Drunk Sex
A woman who can smash it back with me, and then we get frisky, is hot. It's also hot if we get so drunk we don't even remember having sex. A memory completely lost to time, only the faint knowledge that we indulged in each others bodies, an inkling of what we did, faint facsimiles of emotions and experiences not fully remembered.
>Sex at work
I want a chick in a suit to drag me into a closet and bang me to distract me from the monotony of filing paperwork, hiding our experience when someone walks by so we don't get fired, maybe someone stops by and has a conversation in front of the closet, she keeps making me slowly thrust into her to experience the thrill of pleasure while almost being caught, ripped stockings that we don't even consider how to replace because we're so caught up in the moment
>Somnophilia
I already mentioned this, but I'll go more into detail. The idea of being so desperate I can't wait, knowing she'd consent anyway, knowing we're so connected that her body is mine, and my body is hers. Maybe I'll wake up one day, faintly aware of a pleasant sensation as she gives me a blowjob in the early morning, taking advantage of my morning wood. Maybe I'm so desperate for release and I see her, I slip aside her panties and take it slow, I see her squirm in her sleep, I want to release but I don't want to wake her, I want her to enjoy herself and see her subconsciously desire me, see her smile as she has a wet dream as I indulge in her body as she rests, watch her fast contort in her sleep if I cum inside, maybe she wakes up in the middle of the act and before she even realizes what's going on she thrusts back into me out of pure desire.
--- 72969335
>>72969189
I want to taste a girl including her nipples and see how they react to it, but I also think it appeals to the primal desire to mark your territory. At least in a more appealing way than the... other possibilties.
And tight pants are just gorgeous. Same appeal as thigh high socks for people obsessed with those, they make the area eye-catching, attract touching, and make me anticipate to see what's under them more.

>I've been confessing to sexually inappropriate behavior to priests since I was young... or, you could consider it talking about masturbation in an anonymous setting.
Thank god someone else is in the boat that I'm in, I believe most of the reason I wasn't able to have a sexual experience in high school was due to my harsh studying. But besides that I think it was due to a harsh catholic family as well. I was raised roman catholic, and only gone to one confession. I'm still catholic and go to church sometimes on Sundays (I plan to go tomorrow actually). I think it was definetely a factor though, because I felt sort of forced to get what many people call "tradwife purity gf" of the sorts which ties into...
>Ah... how a single person can shape our preferences for the rest of our lives...
Yeah she was a goth/emo of the sorts, more like the ones that listened to Korn and Slipknot though. I talked to her a lot, but never actually tried engaging in a romantic relationship due to what kind of woman she was lol, I was dead afraid of bringing her home and my grandmother (who is also filipino not to mention, very very very superstitious) calling her the devil. I think furthermore, because I never was able to be fully intimate with others its led me to conceptualize sexual situations. I'm just hoping I can get a girlfriend soon, matter a fact I'm talking with a ginger girl online right now, it all seems so silly because most of the girls I had crushes on were redheads it'd almost seem like a weird attraction, but I don't think that's it at all. I'd go with anyone of any hair color, probably White, Latino, or Asian.
sorry for rambling a lot lol its sort of been on my mind because the past week ive casually been talking about sexual topics with people ! thank you. more cat pictures also !!

>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
I'm not attracted to women, but if it was an cute little girl I would like to have a conversation. Maybe if I was comfortable with her she could sit in my lap while we had a few drinks and passed the time - I can talk for hours about a whole lot of nothing if I'm having a good time. I'm not big on making the first moves, I'd much rather her try to seduce me instead.
>What minor feature or action drives you wild?
When a girl I'm mirin at gives a side glare and whips her hair a bit with her hands - telling me shes noticed my gaze, understands her value, and thinks shes above all the "gross boys" but secretly probably likes the attention her outfit gets her
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places?
Eh, the internet is so flushed full of cunny it can be hard to avoid it. I typically browse gelbooru for pictures of my wife. I got some nice loli doujins at Anime Expo last year though.
>>72969189
>I've been sexually overactive since elementary school
How common was this among girls, do you think? Maybe I was oblivious to it growing up in the 90s, but I never would have thought girls would be as precocious as they are today. It's not just social media, they even make cp by taking nudes and sending them out willy nilly as if it wasn't possibly life-ruining for everyone involved. Wish I could reverse the clock and find out for myself, I missed whatever opportunity might have been.
--- 72969441
>>72969246
If I had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, I would flee!

What minor feature or action drives me wild? I've never had a strong preference of type in men. I've never had much of a positive relationship with one; the closest would be my older brother, but that's historically been me wishing he was more invested in my life, and him doing his best to be nice without spending too much time in my vicinity. If I had to say one thing that catches my eye, it would be stubble. The 9-O'-Clock shadow that so many male leads on cop TV shows have seems so masculine and rugged to me. I also like when the men rub their chin thoughtfully, and it makes a sandpaper-esque sound.

Do I find my erotic media in unusual places? Perhaps! I spend time on /h/, /e/, /d/, and /aco/, read stories on AO3 and Gromet's Plaza, and occasionally browse exhentai for doujins or complete albums of art from certain artists.

>>72969322
Lust provoking image does it's job!
Rough sex sounds passionate, but possibly overwhelming. I'm a gentle person, so I imagine it could feel like too much; at the same time, too much is sometimes exactly what I want.
Drunk sex... ahaha. If my life somehow takes a complete reversal of trajectory, and I end up in a relationship, I can't imagine I'd ever have sex sober. I can't imagine doing much of anything sober. 
Sex at work sounds exhilarating, but I worry the fear of discovery would simply paralyze me.
Somnophilia... seems to be the tune of the thread today. I loved your written image of the indulgence. I don't have much to say in response, other than an onomatopoeia an Anon from this thread taught me; hnng.

>>72969335
Ah, well the pants I'm hopeless in trying to appreciate. Thigh high socks are something I've never been able to understand the appeal of, even with how often Anons here have dutifully explained it to me.
--- 72969492
>>72969441
I'm more of a gentle person too. I ran out of character space, the rough sex aspect is more like, provocative woman has been teasing me all day and getting me riled up, not letting me do what I want until the very last minute, until I snap and become an animal, kind of situation. Like a "I wanted to do this the normal way but you've made me snap" kind of situation.

I'm bored, a little drunk, and a bit of a writer (hence why I mentioned liking AO3 earlier) so writing up stuff like this is fun to me.

Gogalking, I believe on Twitter. 

>>72969372
Ah, yes, it seems we very much have a shared experience in this way. I believe I never was able to find a healthy relationship partly because I've never been very interesting or desirable, but also certainly because my mother forbid me from spending any personal time with boys my age. I went to a catholic school, so the teachers enforced it harshly, and by the time I was an adult, they'd become aliens to my mind. I feel I'm still catholic, just a terrible one. I no longer go to church.
I wish you the very best with your redheaded lady! May you find love!

>>72969380
Being examined in an impersonal way is a much more vulnerable situation than being examined in a personal way. For example, getting a physical at a doctor's office makes you feel much more 'naked' than being nude around a peer.

>>72969416
I have no idea how common it might be, I've never had friends my age, young or old. The younguns these days certainly seem hypercharged on sexual energy, but all I know as a child is that I felt such strong urges that resisting them made me cry or vomit. I've never had much of a choice in my behavior.

>>72969492
We have much the same interests it seems! I'm also drunk, though I'm sure it doesn't show that much. (Right?)
I understand more what you meant by animalistic, that seems like a fun dynamic to explore.
--- 72969555
>>72969441
Well, I can try myself. See this pic? Imagine getting to play with that butt, feeling through them as much as you can, and deciding to slowly start taking them off, getting to do it all over again when the panties are exposed. I'm also ashamed to admit that finishing on their clothes before even seeing their bare ass is very hot to me.
I do notice women tend to prefer their partners being naked if they're taking a dominant role, so maybe it's just the way things are.
--- 72969586
>>72969555
While I certainly appreciate the attempt (and the image; self bondage is a personal favorite, though the picture may imply assisted bondage instead) but I'm simply not attracted to women. Try as I might, seeing from your perspective is hopeless!

Also, triple digits!
--- 72969609
>>72969536
You're certainly more coherent than me, I have to keep retyping my messages because I keep making typos.

Dynamics, that's what it all comes down to. Anyone can have a quick fuck and get off and forget about it the next day. The hot part is the build up and the scenario. What led to both people succumbing to their inhibitions? What led to both people wanting to unleash their desires upon one another? In what situation did they unleash those desires? Was it love? Was it lust? Was something so inherently hot about the situation that makes them want to fuck, two people becoming binary code, a 1 and a 0 coming together? A hole made for them to be filled, a hole desperate to be filled?

I dunno, maybe I'm overthinking it, but the hottest part of fetishes is what caused the fetish, not the act of sex itself.
--- 72969727
>>72969586
Well, it's hard to guess someone's sexuality, so... imagine teasing m-I mean, a man bound through his pants instead, and seeing, well, how they react! It could be any kind of outfit that you find any more attractive they're wearing, and you get to fully appreciate it.

> Ah, well the pants I'm hopeless in trying to appreciate. Thigh high socks are something I've never been able to understand the appeal of, even with how often Anons here have dutifully explained it to me.
Tight pants and thigh high socks are feminine. They make girls feel pretty. Girls like drawing attention to their feminine shape and presenting themselves as pretty (and not boyish and dumpy) and guys respond to that exactly how girls want.

>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
Well I am very submissive and I prefer dominate women. But if I were to dominate a women I would do so very gently. I would eat her out and like to use toys on her.

My top 5 are muscles, flirty/smug personality, pink hair, long hair, and thick thighs.

Why hello, moth-kun.
>what would you choose to do to her?
I'd like to go on top of a (vaguely unwilling) girl, hold her wrists to the ground and rest my body weight on her, with my tongue forced in her mouth. The more she struggles, the more pressure I apply to her wrists. The more she moves her head away, the deeper I push my tongue in and out. When she relaxes after the initial panic is when I'd release tension from her and be more loving with her, but I'd reapply force if she tenses up, and then release again when she relaxes. I'd like for the girl to entrust herself entirely with me and be vulnerable, and just let me take care of her needs. Not sexual but I'd also really want to dress up a girl. As in, choose her clothes and put them on her for her, with her just letting me dress her up. It's intimate in my head, okay.

Anyways. Shoulders, collarbones, neck being shown triggers a primal response in me. I cannot overstate the innate urge to simply put my hands on a woman that has those body parts exposed. Ponytails depend on the girl, but I'm a complete sucker for bangs. If a coworker girl leans into me when I speak to her so that I can feel her breathing on me, I do get hard. They're in my personal space so casually. They're unaware of the danger of doing that. Ah, well.

this website has porn boards, it's very convenient
there are rule 34 websites and it's fun to scroll through looking for the well drawn stuff, separating the wheat from the chaff
pornhub and similar sites are also an option, but they try to push certain categories on you even if you search for something else

I have a think for sporty girls with ponytails, especially when they have a flat/toned tummy. I think because my older sister's friends growing up were athletic

I think it's probably the dominance aspect, it also would make me feel sexy since they're so turned on that they're doing something objectively uncomfortable yet still feel good overall due to the mental component. I also really like cute/pretty girls' faces, seeing one on and completely submitting to my cock would be hotter than any tits or ass.

You definitely can! I trained myself by writing short stories, or chronicling the events of my day, while as wasted as I could manage. I also played typing games to cut back on typos!
No, my heart would give out if I was put in a position where leadership was expected of me. Let alone sexual assertiveness. My mother has always referred to me as 'delicate'. I used to have fainting spells in highschool, leading to a not insignificant number of concussions, owing to nobody ever moved to catch me as I fell. If I had to be sexually dominant, I'd likely faint on the spot.

>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
Personality like being cool or cute and is interested in something. I am not dating a whore who has no interest in life.
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
No , the internet is filled with softcore porn.
Usually just browsing lewd arts on Twitter. Or read doujin that's taboo tagged to give it a little unique taste (like incest or femdom and yuri or just straight up genderbend and crossdressing.)

>Demanding vulnerability
Well. It's a bit more than a demand. I imagine myself holding a girl through a panic attack, including through her subsequent kicking and screaming, until she gives in and hugs me back. Pressing a girl by teaching her body how to respond to mine for the path of least resistance is par for the course.

It's the feminine allure. Something about just touching them and lightly putting my fingers across them drives me insane. Though, probably the innocuousness is what makes me want to take care of the girl as well.

Well, yes, I believe I understood your intentions.

I'm mostly good at drunk typing, but it gets tricky if I've had too much (like tonight, I tried to finish off my entire alcohol stash so I can start eating healthier in the future). It just makes me drunk and horny without any regard for what I'm typing. Hence why I talked about all my fetishes here. Didn't even mention how I find teachers hot (the power dynamic of someone above you making you please them despite it being unethical, how you can both lose your positions but you don't care because it feels so good). I just find a lot of things that are slightly taboo exciting because I live a boring life. If only I knew what you were into, then I could find a reason to find it hot and expand upon it.

Most fembots understand how easily manipulated boys are. Now you understand how to manipulate boys. Het guys are attracted to *anything* feminine-presenting &amp; girls know signs of submission to femininity drive men wild, and there are lots of ways to do that (especially since female anatomy and physiology does most of the heavy lifting)

Ah, the teacher fantasy is a very exciting one, but having priests and nuns pushing their eighties certainly spoiled the appeal for me growing up. I hear stories of people having attractive teachers and I can't imagine what sort of trouble I may have found myself in. (Well, yes I can. Most likely I would daydream, forget to take notes, and get terrible grades. I'm not so bold as to approach and I've never been so attractive as to lure.)
It's peculiar, I don't honestly know what I'm into... during my youth, it was purely a shameful, desperate bid for release. If I ever used material, I felt immense guilt. Now as an adult, I've largely been conditioned to associate guilt with sexual pleasure, so, well, I think I'm coming to realize that my religious upbringing could have left a traumatic imprint on my mind that has altered my sexual psychology forever. The subject of my self pleasure is secondary to the guilt I feel for using it, in terms of arousal.

>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
Take her back to her place and turn her family into my harem. Mom, sisters, friends, cousins, all of them. They would be mine. The incest isn't THAT important, but I do like it as a feature of a my potential harem. 
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
Bare shoulders, don't know why but they get me going. It's so lewd in a way that I can't really explain. 
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
Unusual? Not really. I like erodoujins much more than real life pornography, so I usually find something I haven't read on nhentai, and if that doesn't do it I go jerk off while reading my old reliable, a doujin called Katekano.

1) Use her as a slave for my own convenience and pleasure. Mold her to my preferences

2)Submissiviness, being into the same fetishes/kinks and obedience, since I'm controlling. Physical thingy is probably if she has extremely long, not dyed, hair; also if she's fat, or at least chubby.

3) Don't really search/use erotic media

Not to sound like a faggot, but I'd ask her if she was okay with me. I know it might be shameful to say, but I'm not a rapist and never could be. I have too much empathy for the pain of others. Say she's the typical self insert's girlfriend you see people and the first thing id want to do is ask her name. Hug her, smell her hair, cuddle, go out somewhere nice. Of course I'd be down to fuck like a dog when the day was done, but the suddenness would make me cautious.

As for actions and features, I like women that don't chatter. I like it when I can sit on the couch or bed and they don't ask me stupid questions like "What are you doing" or shit. I like it when they let the silence of the room lie. I also like it when they initiate cuddling. Say I'm lounging on the couch, id love for her to wordlessly cuddle up next to me and snuggle under my chin. I'm weird about talking. Sometimes I can talk for literally hours, most times I wish people would just shut the fuck up. Specific features beyond the expected boob or butt shape, I love green eyes. Rarest color in the world but they're a wonder to see. I also like beauty marks.

Lastly erotic media: i usually jerk it to drawn stuff. I prefer amateur porn vids and I actually find regular porn to be disgusting and annoying. The reactions are so disgustingly fake and absurd, especially (like i mentioned before) all the goddamned chatter. I love videos made by couples and often fixate on how they have lingering kisses, stare into eachothers eyes, latch onto eachother. I'm also a romantic and loving reading stories and fanfiction with goopy, sappy interactions. I hate romance movies though because they just feel so fake. My go to provider for porn is paheal dot net, the rule 34 sight, Danbooru, and xvideos for amateur couple love making. 

Siiiiiiggghhhhh. I want a loving wife and children so badly. What I wouldn't give to come home to hot dinner, a kiss on the cheek, and little ones on my legs. I want a family.

I see. I hate anything bittersweet, and if it makes you sick your stomach I don't think the good outweighs the bad for the discussion. The arousal seems to be a separation of concerns; guilty pleasures for you seem to be self-fulfilling, in a way. I'll stick to the lovey dovey things, effective harm is a turn off in any case.

I love hair. I'm a black guy with the typical hair pattern and that extends to the pubes. Because of the curls, we're more susceptible to hair bumps so I stopped shaving early on in puberty cause that shit sucked. The welts would be inflamed and painful anywhere I shaved. Years later and I've still got rumble in the jungle. The few girls I've been with were always smooth and I just didn't like the look after seeing my natural state for so long. Its not a fetish to me anymore than liking a non fat woman is. Wish girls would stop shaving.

first of all id want a girl who will like me and be okay with me being myself
and my dream romantic relationship is a stockholm syndrome one. ever since i was 16 i fell in love with the idea, and im in my 30's. i remember reading books on this subject like they were love romance novels. its so dreamy to me. violence into love bombing. just the thought of her going in and out of consciousness to me, its all super dreamy, and pulses waves of anxiety in my heart

in my fantasies, id spend all my time with her with my hand on her neck. that would be far and away my absolute favorite spot on her body. i dont care how pretty her face is or how large her natural breasts are. i just want my hand on her neck at all times
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.

i make a distinction because sexual desire and romantic desire
i get off sexually to cuckings couples or families, teens, beating a girl while fucking her bully, creampie orgies. just heterosexual stuff. once i cum i forget about it. i dont really care much for sexual thoughts
sexual things dont really matter much to me. they're just there to enjoy, but i dont really care much for it, honestly

i will never be with a real girl, for various reasons, so i just kind of accepted im going to die alone. my only hope is a ai-robo gf. thats what gives me hope for the future

>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
first cuddle, then forehead and nose kisses, then I would start licking and working my way further down. I would suck her boobs for a long time and bite a lil as I did, then eventually move further and further down till I start eating her pussy. Then I'd flip her over, spank her, rub her pussy a bit more and go in doggystyle, holding her waist with one hand and her breast with another. Ideally, I would try to time it so we both cum together, but I have heard this is hard to achieve. Then more cuddling.
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
freckles, large noses with character, arguing with me competently, being very casual in style. I know the difference between "no makeup" and real no makeup, and real no makeup is hotter. Enthusiasm for most things. For some reason in activates my neurons when (biological women, with no dick) say "suck my dick."
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
nhentai mostly; yandere, incest, femdom, and straight shota. Also achieveofourown for similar stuff, but less femdomy. I'm really more switchy than subby, but it's easier to self-insert when the guy is a sub.
--- 72971946
>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?

I want us to cuddle. I want her to hold me. I want her to play with my hair. I want to treat her like a princess and do cute still like give her bubble baths. I want her call me a good boy. Then we can have romantic lovey-dovey sex.

>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.

Shoulder length black hair in a half-up top knot always made me fall apart. Pic related (ideally a bit shorter).

>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
I'd really like to eat out a woman for hours on end. I feel like that's about the most intimate thing you can do. It also legitimately just seems like fun activity, I don't think I could get tired of it. I'd make a challenge out of it to see how many orgasms I can give her in a certain amount of time, or do the opposite and take things agonizingly slow to see if I can build up to an orgasm that's better than the last. I'm getting a bit older and my refractory period isn't what it used to be, but I still like the idea of continuously having sex over extended periods of time, so focusing on her a lot seems like an win-win.

>What minor feature or action drives you wild?
I really like the look of tired eyes for some reason. Bags, dark circles, the crow's feet older women get. It adds a certain warmth and kindness to facial expressions, especially when smiling. I'm not a fan of Botox.

>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
I haven't been interested in porn for a while now. In my teens and early twenties I was pretty autistic and just saved pictures of pretty girls. Nowadays I don't masturbate that often and when I do it's usually to my own fantasy or vanilla 2D.

If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
I'd start with cuddling. If she seems to be into it, I'd start fooling around and try a kiss.
I'd continue undressing her and start with some foreplay leading into sex, but only if she wants it too.
Sex without both parties truly wanting it is really boring.

>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
Unexpected hugs and kisses drive me wild. I'd want a partner who is at least a little pro-active and doesn't expect me to initiate every little interaction (not that I'd expect her to do all the work, of course).
Aside from that, I really like short hair and freckles. Oh and I like it when women don't use (a lot of) makeup.

I usually just use 4chan's /aco/, /h/ and /gif/ boards.

Run my trimmed fingernails down her torso. Trace her muscles. Kiss the places her body reacts to the most. Tell her she's beautiful. Hypnotize her. Perform awakening procedures on her to bring out the flame that resides within her. Remember your true name. Remember your true name. Remember your true name. She will learn it eventually. She follows my trail of breadcrumbs. She becomes as awakened as me. She thanks me, equally I thank her. We pool our resources, get married five years in for tax purposes, but we're more than just husband and wife. We're soulmates. We make enough money to buy a home. We have two children. Ideally a male and a female. Raise the boy to protect his sister at all costs. Raise the girl to respect her brother. Raise them to see each other not as equals, but as yin and yang. Raise them strong, calm, willful, yet still kind, generous, and loving. Grow old. Die together with a modest retirement. Perhaps we choose to die taking a bunch of crazy drugs and going out tripping while we hold each other in our arms. Neither of us wants to live without the other. Our children understand. They saw how strong and pure our love was and how it would overcome any adversity. They seek out equal partners as us, and find them eventually, repeating the cycle of hope that true love does exist, that this is what all of human existence is for. To find love with someone who loves you equally. To contribute angels to a world riddled with demons. To give hope.

>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
Hard to say. I'm pretty vanilla with exception of few highly degenerate kinks which conflict with idea of relationship I'd like. So the answers depends on how realistically are we talking here. Anything as really anything, or anything within realistic context of not ignoring relationship type I'd want.
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
Impreg/breeding themed dirty talk and gestures like leglocking etc. Fomr non-purely sexual things it'd be certain types of clothing that is modest, yet can reveal just enough to make it enticing and hot. I find "secrecy" and temptation to reveal more often more arousing than blatant shoving itnercourse straight into your face.
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
Most of the time internet. Mostly amateur stuff on "facebook for sex" type websites, meaning real amateur stuff, not shitty auditions, OF or "real swingers orgies". If it's for some unusual, degenerate kink I want to satisfy at the time, I have to stray to various tube sites. If porn is not enough I just go to my usual hooker for some physical touch, caressing and vanilla sex, but that happens once a month or couple.

Both of us being fully clothed, I want her to straddle me while I'm sitting down. Then I want to run my hands all along her body, I just want us to feel each other. I want to caress the side of her face, look into her eyes, see her smile when I tell her how beautiful she is, tell her how much I love her and how much she means to me. And I guess since this is supposed to be sexual, we would undress each other at some point, then I'd eat her out until she cums, bend her over the arm of the couch, one hand gripping her hair, the other pinning her arms behind her back, then I fuck the shit out of her until cum. Afterwards, we cuddle and watch something stupid on TV.

It's not shameful to not want to be a rapist, Anon, that wasn't the spirit of when I asked the question, although I expected the responses to veer that direction a fair amount, considering where we are.

Bittersweet is as good as it gets on my side of the tracks, Anon. Sickly sweet is something else, a slightly different sensation; bittersweet is happiness and sadness. Sickly sweet is pleasure and disgust combined, the guilt being an expected third party. I'm somewhat confused here though; me saying I feel sickly sweet is too much for you, but in your daydream, the girl has a full panic attack; that's not beyond your limits? I'm not judgmental when it comes to really any fetishes, but that certainly seems like a confusing set of boundaries.

>>72971376
That's such an interesting way to develop a preference! Smooth skin feeling alien is, I think, part of why most men prefer it. Men tend to enjoy experiencing women as an entirely new species. If you're black and your body hair was thick and coarse, how would you respond to a woman if she didn't shave, but her hair was still very thin and soft? Blonde? I imagine it'd be different from dark and curly.

Oh hey you're back. Thought this thread would be dead when I woke up.
I also have a weird relationship with religion. I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness and thought I was gonna go to hell because I jerked off sometimes, which is probably why I started developing a bunch of different fetishes. To "liberate" my sexuality.
I can see something like that being hot. God himself said "Be fruitful and multiply," and yet sex and lust are considered sins, so a dynamic where a pious youth feels shame for their desires, and turns to a wisened member of the church to ease their worries, being shamed the whole time for what they're currently experiencing. Ave Maria! To give in to the whims of the devil, to enjoy it so much despite knowing its wrong. I'd personally be more into doing something like this to a nun who took an oath of chastity, to forever change their life and make them question their faith, but it'd be hot on both sides I can imagine.

hello again, didn't see your threads for a while.

>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
i enjoy the experience of exploring the sexual rabbit hole together. i have some hard passes but i'm willing to try anything else at least once and see if it works for both of us. hell, i can enjoy vanilla missionary if she's enjoying it too.

>What minor feature or action drives you wild?
oh well... this could turn in to a quite long list. i like women with a bit of fat at right places and never felt that much attraction to skinny sticks. also i like women with glasses, there's something about them i fail to describe. but the attraction comes from mannerisms. that smirk, those flutterning eyelashes, how she modulates her voice, the way her hips sway when she walks etc. if those are done well, then even 5/10 becomes 8/10 in my eyes.

>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places?
no, not really unless we're talking about nudes sent to me. for jerkoff sessions i go to well known video streaming sites.

>>72975562
>Have you ever 'eaten out' a woman before? What was the experience like to you?
In a distant past. I was much more naive and unactualized back then and got involved with a woman I shouldn't have gotten involved with. I would have preferred to only be intimate with one person for the rest of my life, so I no longer think about them now, nor do I cherish the memory. Sorry for the awkward answer. I'd still like to explore it properly with the right partner.

>Bittersweet is as good as it gets on my side of the tracks, Anon
Ah. Whenever I use the wording of something making my stomach sick, I think of something dreadful and unwanted entirely. It's why I thought the 'guilty pleasure' aspect was also similarly unwanted. I then called that bittersweet, but I think I see what you mean now between something evoking disgust versus sadness. My wording of 'disgust' would probably be 'degen', though (if that has the same meaning for you). 
I likely didn't add enough detail to what specific template of a personality of a girl I'd be imposing myself on, but it's the tsundere, playing hard-to-get type. There'd already be an established tension of playing and teasing, and any pushy actions taken are out of possessiveness and chemistry, and a reciprocally enjoyed touch, though just not explicitly consensual. There's a distinction in my head between something unconsensual with a stranger versus being possessive of someone only hesitant (or panicking); the former being cruel and unloving, the latter being caring and stupidly "overprotective". In regards to a girl panicking (I've never had an attack like that, perhaps my fantasy here is heartless), I think just hugging her tight until she realizes there's no real danger and she feels assured and I can caress her would be nice. 

In any case, for something outright unconsensual, I guess the outcome is dependent on whether or not I'd enjoy it. Outcome-dependence is by definition not much of a boundary, this fantasy will remain as such. But if it's an anime-esque "Y-you have to take responsibility now you know" by an embarrassed girl, and there's a happy-ever-after, I think that's endearing. But if there's a sensation of a girl being broken, feeling hollow and unclean and having emotional trauma of the matter, that's not at all interesting to me. 
I hope this kind of makes sense.
--- 72976844
>if you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
I've had a fantasy where I'd make a woman do a physical activity, like push-ups, and when she fails I'd finger her and kiss her as "punishment" for not completing the task. She wouldn't be able to resist because her arms would be too sore to do anything
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
Long flowing hair, specifically a lighter brown color, is my go to favorite hair style for a woman. Something about it seems so elegant and out of reach for me.
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
I started Berserk a few days ago and the scenes/panels of women in lewd situations are so well drawn and beautiful, it makes me feel weird cause I know they're almost always getting raped or murdered, but the way they're drawn is very hot.

It'd definitely be alien, but more like a different kind of human and less like a plucked chicken. I've encountered this before in school and even adulthood with friends where they'd be curious about my hair when I had dreads or a huge afro and when I had to use a pick to comb it, pic related. Theyd rub my hair and be amazed and I'd rub theirs back jealous of the silky smoothness. I don't mean anything bad by this when I say it reminds me of dog's hair. I could imagine rubbing my partner's hair in a cuddle would give a similar emotional feeling to rubbing a big dog while snuggled together.

 White people altogether feel very alien to me though, but I guess thats more to do with me having always felt like an outsider even in my own family. I know they're human, but I still feel a gulf. Now add social awkwardness, a feeling of almost species level otherness due to race, ON TOP of being the opposite sex and yeah, women really are from another world to me, to the point I actually don't like interacting with them at all. I've also spent most of my adult life surrounded by only men in my electrician job, so I've got physical isolation from them as well.

I wish. You can buy any sex act you want, fulfill any weird fetish with a prostitute, she can shit on your face if you pay enough.

Hi-Ya!

>>72976066
I thought this thread would be dead when I woke as well, but here we are, I suppose.
Did you develop fetishes intentionally, or was it a subconscious action? For me, mostly everything I'm into was an accident I'm stuck experiencing. 
I experienced it nearly exactly how you describe; I'd deal with my urges, feel guilt, go to confessional. My priest would make me describe everything I'd done, in detail, which would inevitably excite me again as he chastised me. It was a miserable cycle for me at that age, when the guilt was more sincere, but I now sometimes miss the experience. It's much of why I post here; anonymous confession is anonymous confession, after all.

>>72976173
I didn't make a thread for some time after the last one ended rather terribly.
Mutual fetish exploration sounds exciting; it carries some of that youthful magic I imagine would come from fooling around for the first time. Sigh. All too often I can't avoid feeling my youth was wasted.

>>72976537
Ah, then I won't push the subject.

>>72976844

--- 72977525
>>72976804
Well... gosh, this is digging a deep topic. When I say disgust, I'm referring to a certain barrier of self loathing. To go through something like you're describing, there is an inherent level of ego death that I think a woman would need to endure; engaging with a total loss of control and authority. It can be deeply exciting and arousing, but also somewhat horrifying, on an existential scale. I'm a frequent browser of the patriarchy threads on /d/ for this reason, but importantly, the fictional world they build in those threads is somewhat gentle; the entire world structure is ordered around the authoritative gender dynamics, and because of how little influence women are given, they're also protected by laws and common decency. Part of the fantasy there is that while the world becomes a somewhat bizarre dystopia where women are made to be fully subservient on every level, men are also beholden to codes of honor and are somewhat forced to be their best versions of themselves. It's a hypothetically perfect arrangement that could never genuinely come to exist naturally, but it's an important aspect of the concept (and what differentiates it from the slave/maledom threads) because in that setting, women undergoing that type of ego death, and abandoning their self governance, comes with something like a promise of safety and fair treatment, which isn't something that can be trusted in our reality. Which makes it much more terrifying.

If it's more of a game, where she teases you, I can imagine that being much less intense. The reason I didn't assume it more lighthearted in nature (like I prefer to do) is because you mentioned panic attacks, which I can tell you from experience are not something that can be easily ridden out; undergoing one, and being held during it, would prompt the ego death I described. There's not many ways for a person's psyche to recover from an internal combustion like that, and offloading the idea of the self entirely is one of them.
--- 72977578
>>72977477
Don't take this the wrong way, but what exactly is wrong with you that you occupy yourself with threads like this? Are you disfigured? I understand the Catholicism having an influence on your life part but how did this come to be an outlet for you specifically? Mental illness is usually not a detriment for women.
--- 72977646
>>72977477
>Did you develop fetishes intentionally, or was it a subconscious action?
It was subconscious, I'm pretty sure. I'd find something sexually enticing, then I'd open a magazine that talked about how masturbation was a sin and feel immense guilt, then find something a little more deviant, then hear a speech about how you need to repent if you feel lust as a youth, and the cycle would repeat. It was all internal, I was too ashamed to even tell anyone that I was a "sinner," which I guess made things worse, because now I fantasize about various fetish scenarios in most waking moments of the day to pass the time.

Ah, so for you it's almost like we're the priest you're confessing to. Or maybe you're the priest listening to us confess our sins? Getting off to both sides of the situation. That's a pretty cool way to retake your sexuality after all those years.
--- 72977673
>>72977179
>How did you evolve this preference?
I'm not 100% sure but I've read that men who grow up in poor or high stress environments, tend to like bigger women. Which does seem to line up with me.
>Have you had a chance to enjoy it in real life, or is it relegated to erotic fiction?
I have actually. Is there anything specific you want to know?
--- 72977783
>>72976804
So if I gather and assume correctly, from how you describe your hopes, it would be a sheepish reluctance you wish to burrow past, rather than fear or panic. As so often relevant within these threads, it's embarrassment, shame, guilt, these sorts of feelings that can be eroded through aggressive affection. Panic knows no logic and no resolution, so unfortunately, there's no way to turn that mentality into something warm.

>>72977311
I certainly understand the alien sensation, and the ethnic gulf. Back when I still had the energy and resilience to work in-person jobs, I had a coworker who was black, and every time I interacted with him, I felt like I was meeting an exotic animal on a safari. Please don't take that in a racist meaning, I don't intend it that way, but growing up in the midwest, a small catholic town, I'd rarely met black people in my life. He was much taller than me, and smelled like coconut, which I assume was due to hair product. I'm rather short, even compared to the average, so it was always very novel as well as intimidating. He was rather polite, if unsocial; I think he may have been somewhat of a pothead.
I can certainly relate... at a certain point, the breadth of unfamiliarity between yourself and those opposite becomes so wide that crossing it seems a pointless concept.

>>72977320
Ah. Well, yes, I can't deny that myself. I doubt I'll ever find love in my life. I hope that you do manage to do so.

>>72977578
Well, doctors frighten me, so I can't say with any authority, but I'm fairly confident that I have a violent case of agoraphobia. Everything frightens me. I'm not disfigured, but I've never been attractive, and for much of my life I was overweight due to health issues, so every constructive social interaction I've experienced in my life could be counted on my fingers. By the time I was older and living on my own, the lockdown occurred, and I found solace in solitude. By the time it ended I'd become incapable of ever returning.
--- 72977924

>Mutual fetish exploration sounds exciting; it carries some of that youthful magic I imagine would come from fooling around for the first time. Sigh. All too often I can't avoid feeling my youth was wasted.
well, i made it to 30 without losing my v-card. i used to be highly undesirable, fixed lot of things at my life, including my body (as much as my injuries allow) and then it all let loose.

i wouldn't call it wasting since adults tend to leave most of anxious bullshit behind. within three years i caught up with most of my fantasies and even exceeded some. but i understand your sentiment and feel a bit of it as well.

As for how this specific place became an outlet, that's been recent. I spent most of my time on this website browsing /d/, /e/, /aco/, but never approached /r9k/ until earlier this year. I heard it'd become aliken to /soc/, but without the expectation of true connection; a pseudo-social spam board. While I recognize that likely is an unhappy evolution for most, as I recall /r9k/ being a board centered on humor and coping with loneliness, the internet is ever-evolving, and once I visited (and saw the state of things; not a /soc/-lite, but a turbo-/b/), I felt my personal brand of coom-versation would be a nice reprieve from malicious spamming, and threads that fixate on the girls. Boys want attention too, I know, so I'm trying to offer that, both out of the goodness of my heart, and because it's deeply enjoyable for me on a personal level. Mutually beneficial, is how they say?

>>72977673
That's very interesting! I wonder if it's because of some deeply-rooted biological registry, that identifies chubbier women as indicating a stable life due to plentiful food. Maybe it's a more simple "soft and warm helps reduce stress levels", though I thought that largely only applied to secondary sexual characteristics, being breasts, hips, heinies. 

>>72977924
I'm sorry you've experienced that, Anon. I don't believe I was ever grossly unattractive, but I doubt I'd ever be considered above average. I know men like their numerated scales, so if I had to place myself, I'd probably guess that I'm a three to four out of ten, and possibly a two when I was younger and more overweight.

>>72977946

Do you mean in contrast, they don't get that kind of fair treatment and promise safety (since they're slaves)? I also saw the most recent patriarchy thread, I like fantasy settings and D&amp;D, reminds me of some world building threads on used see on /tg/ a lot.

>>72977783
>it would be a sheepish reluctance you wish to burrow past
That's especially hot. God I want kiss you and reassure your hesitance away.. In regards to panic, I think it's just the reactions of an easily startled girl that make me find it cute. With panic, I imagine a certain bewilderment not attributed to anything specific, just general confusion and lack of emotional grounding, and in general issues without detail in my opinion can just be cuddled away. Which is why I mentioned I ought to just hold onto the girl. A strong emotional reaction being met with a strong physical reassurance is the brutish way, but I'd prefer the gentle caress and words of reassurance method.

Hrrm. I believe I've made one since then, and posted in a few threads not of my own making since as well. The last time I made one of these, I was somewhat bounced back and forth between an Anon who was trying earnestly to court me despite my discouragement, and an Anon who was attempting to evangelize me back to the church, despite my discouragement. It was somewhat stressful, and caused the thread to be fully fixated on me as the subject, which is the thing I wish to avoid at all costs. These threads are for Robots. I'm merely a host.
I'm not quite thirty yet, but I'll likely join you in crossing the wizard-barrier before long. I'll turn twenty-six in a matter of months; I know it certainly isn't old by objective measures, but my mother was married at eighteen, and intended me to be so as well.

>>72978151
I mean that undergoing an ego death in a hypothetical patriarchy-utopia promises a limitation of self governance, but a good and fair life, assuming you give up that control of your life, and no longer evaluate what is alright and what isn't. If you adapt to the structured belief system and internalize it, then by those standards, you will have a guarantee of being treated incredibly well. In the slave-dystopia, there's no such promise. In reality, there's no such promise. If I were to be the most dutiful christian woman there's ever been, I still might well have ended up abused and mistreated, and likely nobody would have intervened in my stead. Much of what I feel has eroded traditional social values in an increasing fear within women that giving up self governance would lead them to have no control in a possible - or likely - abusive relationship, and it's that thinking that eroded trust between men and women, and dissolved much of the structure that was part of marriage; an exchange of control for security, an exchange of freedom for affection. The trust in that trade is gone today. The reason the patriarchy thread appeals to many is because it restores the trust for both parties, if a bit forcefully in both cases; they talk of executing men who behave dishonorably and heavily punishing women who disobey the social order.
Shush, devil! Hnng and such, you vagabond!
You describe panic as resembling a combination confusion and disorientation; it's more comparable to the meeting of abject terror and dissociation. Embarrassment or reluctance being gently but insistently eroded and washed away seems much more akin to what your fantasy outlines, at least from what I'm able to tell of your descriptions.

That's the thing. Most of the women I've talked to all type the same, think the same, speak the same. As a writer, I appreciate someone more verbose and open with their thoughts.

>I don't believe I was ever grossly unattractive, I'd probably guess that I'm a three to four out of ten, and possibly a two when I was younger and more overweight.
A 2 is what I considered myself for most of my life and from my perspective it would seem that that's approaching 'grossly unattractive' territory in the eyes of the average woman.
That said, I have recently re-examined the theories of Freud, while overthinking some of the more unconventional things I'm attracted to, and I think he may have actually been on to something - and there's somewhat of a whitepill in there. If we assume that the things we find attractive are largely imprinted onto us by our parents or other role models during our formative years, it might be possible to find a partner who is genuinely attracted to us if they grew up with a good parental figure who resembles us. This would still make them a small minority of the population but not non-existent. It might be cope but the idea has slightly re-ignited my motivation to put effort into looking for someone.

Anyway, I hear you on not wanting to make the thread all about you, but would you consider answering your own questions for us?

Well I'm glad you gave it a shot! Perhaps you could suggest inviting new participants in hopes you make new connections?

>>72978567
Ah, I consider 'grossly unattractive' to be along the lines of burn victims, that particular look that inbred red-necks tend to have, or truly obese and revolting people who remind you of pigs; that's a one out of ten, in my eyes. I would consider a 2/10 'very ugly', a 3/10 'ugly', 4/10 'dull', 5/10' plain', and then onto positive words. Though that's likely not how most people view the scale, I've never been encouraged to judge others, and in never having the chance to choose from an array of options, never developed any personal metric by which to compare people's looks.
As for answering my own questions, I have! Anon asked me to do so, and I complied here: >>72969441
(I hope you find your lady with a biological leaning to appreciate you, if that's at all how the world works.)

>>72978587
Rats! I was so confident!

>>72978603
Yes, I'm well aware of the effect my gender can have. My hope is Anons such as yourself might come to understand the point of my goal, and appreciate it for what it is, as opposed to pushing me to behave like the majority of the folk who seek to artificially acquire celebrity status.
I'm sorry you've been treated terribly, and lost the courage to trust and be vulnerable. I've experienced much of the same, and I similarly have been battered back from attempting to integrate into a regular lifestyle. I am a snail, and I stay in my shell, where it's safe and cozy.

>>72978612
How does this 'semen retention' effect you? I know little about it.
--- 72978871
Pregnancy, too easy. I just want to take a woman, knock her up, then ideally we get married and learn more about each other over the years and happily ever after. But at a minimum she's carrying my baby to term and undergoing all the wonderful bodily transformations that comes with motherhood. Breasts grow, nipples grow, milk glands develop, she gets that cute dark line running vertically over her belly, joints loosen, even her face might get that mask of pregnancy coloration.
Minor feature that drives me wild is when I catch a whiff of her natural feminine scent. It's rare but every now and then I encounter a woman that didn't wear deodorant and it's instant boner fuel. I'll be thinking about it hours afterward.
Lots has come from /s/, but used to you could just Google stuff and find goldmines on tumbler. My go-to is my stash. Only the finest curated content from years of wanting a woman I can call my own. Most porn is actually pretty gross so you can't exactly start looking for it when you want to get off.

>How does this 'semen retention' effect you?
It's assisting against lack of brainfog, lack of energy and lack of nutrient deficiencies, among other things

I don't know if you're doing this for your own entertainment or a college assignment or a "survey about dangerous incels" but narcissists love talking about themselves so why not.
>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
What she wants. I had a gf in highschool through college. Only girl I've ever had interest in and the only one who ever showed me interest. It took a long time for her to be open about what she wanted in bed and when she did things improved markedly.
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
A cute back. Thighs. Wearing hair long if possible. Anklets. Neck biting is probably my biggest non-sexual kink thanks to her. Sex wise I developed a chubby fetish because she kind of groomed me into it.
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
pretty much don't. I use my imagination or go to very specific artists who at least seem as though they aren't virgins. There's specific things in a doujin or h-video that let you know the person making it has experience or not.
>Please be as descriptive as possible. There are curious minds which value your words.
Anything else?

i don't like blaming a single gender for all my ailments and traumas. it was simply a society ousting out the undesirable one and being resented by the opposite gender was a part of it. now that i own a car, apartment, have stable income, decent physique (dropped almost 150 pounds), the same society would like to have me back and well... i'm not taking this bait again, especially since i have experience with being lead on...

>My hope is Anons such as yourself might come to understand the point of my goal, and appreciate it for what it is, as opposed to pushing me to behave like the majority of the folk who seek to artificially acquire celebrity status.
i like this and similar threads. they're rare here on /r9k/. there was a monk-anon making selfhelp generals almost daily and we had a nice little community over there before he vanished and his threads with him (i managed to get in touch with him over discord though). one of those few genuine threads and this one is giving me similar vibes.

>I'm sorry you've been treated terribly, and lost the courage to trust and be vulnerable.
no need to be, you did not play any part in it. i've always been a loner and could count my friends or acquaintances on digits of a single hand. it's always better to be alone in solitude than alone in relationship.

>I've experienced much of the same, and I similarly have been battered back from attempting to integrate into a regular lifestyle. I am a snail, and I stay in my shell, where it's safe and cozy.
any particular events that made you what you are now? my first ex told me something very similar - that i built a massive fortress around my heart and lost the way out and the gate key as well. can't get that line out of my head from some reason even after those years.

also, what is the avatar you're using? she's quite cute.

>if a bit forcefully in both cases; they talk of executing men who behave dishonorably 
I see the appeal now, yes. I'd probably have quite the wordy bit to say in the form of "We live in a society", but in general, I think having a social courtesy code, and having an atmosphere of values (with the basis being the family as the most precious, atomic unit) being as self-evident for everyone being very nice.

>abject terror and dissociation
I'm not very fond of this, no. Though I do think the source of terror also matter in context. For example, if I just so happen to overwhelm a certain delicate someone with intense, overly direct propositions so that it triggers a nervous stress reaction, (and her fight or flight kicks in and she panics), I'd feel only slightly guilty (and find it slightly comical) but would want to make it up to her somehow. I'd probably continue with the same approach with affection, and holding her (as in, being there for her rather than pinning her down) until she calms down.
>Embarrassment or reluctance being gently but insistently eroded and washed away
This is very cutely worded, I like it, and it is exactly it!

Holy shit, is that thing with the tomato soup legit? Hope you didn't scald yourself. Sauces stick and burn. I'd be pissed off if I dropped my lunch after cooking it. Had a bug jump into a giant load of salmon I was scrambling and I lost it. Threw the stuff out in the woods and swung the pan so hard the handle came off.

>If you had the opportunity to do anything at all to a woman, what would you choose to do to her?
If I can pick the woman I'd give my best friend a hug :)
>What minor feature or action drives you wild? It could be something like a certain mouth shape, or when a woman ties her hair in a ponytail; that sort of thing.
I don't think anything really drives me "wild." I like a good butt and red hair but nothing makes me want to immediately pounce and mate or anything 
>Do you find your erotic media in unusual places? Where is your go-to provider once aroused and committed to the act?
Usually just gif or p*rn h*b. Sometimes nh*ntai

Men actually LIKE how women get during pregnancy? Are you sure? Chubby, moody, delicate? I could never have imagined. Really? Sincerely?

>>72978880
Ah, I do know what you mean. I savour and prolong my arousal for the express purpose of that brainfog.

>>72978906
I dropped out of community college years ago. This is for personal fulfillment, Anon.
How were you groomed into preferring chubby women? What makes a back 'cute'?

>>72978930
I'm glad this thread feels genuine to you! I have no wisdom to offer that would help Anons self improve, masturbation and self loathing is about all I'm good for, but I hoped that having a place to discuss their sexuality would be a nice outlet for the men here.
I wholeheartedly agree; it's better to be alone in solitude than alone among others.
As for particular events, yes, certainly. Several. I hope to keep these threads lighthearted, so telling certain tales could be counterproductive. I've never been sexually assaulted or anything that extreme, but plenty of instances of humiliation, or mistreatment from authority figures. There are a few that would probably be somewhat erotic seeming, even if they're terrible recollections from my end.
I'm not personally very aware of who the characters I post are supposed to be; I downloaded the artist's full backlog, and just select freely from the folder as I post.

>>72978960
Yes, that's the appeal, it's just been injected with a lethal dose of fetish as well, ahaha...
I assumed that wouldn't be your preference from how you spoke; ahh, with a, in a situation like, with, a, very delicate individual like you described. I honestly couldn't tell how it would pan out, if such an occurrence,, em, occurred. Forceful affection is alien. Affection is alien, in honesty. 'Hnng', if you will pardon my french!

Ah, it definitely burned my skin, but not terribly. It's pink and slightly raised but nothing is peeling away; I burned my hand because I touched the bowl-part of the pot, not due to the handle being so hot.

>>72979243
My brother also likes red hair!
--- 72979330
>>72979285
Having a place like this where I can go "Yeah I think this is hot, it makes me horny" without being judged is pretty nice. I've always been somewhat ashamed of being a sexual being, as it were. Like I need to hide that I get horny, or that sometimes I just want to bend a woman I see over the table and have my way with her. Have to be "civilized" 24/7, can't show my true colors. That's how it usually feels.

My gf got pretty chubby after we broke up in highschool. When she reached back out to me in college we had sex for the first time (both first times) and eventually she let on that she enjoyed having her body groped, especially her thighs and belly, being fed, etc. 
I'm not sure what makes a woman's back cute. I just enjoy it.
There were some other things she left me with that weren't so great, like an attraction towards needy women. She confessed to cheating on me days after we began seriously discussing marriage, and I haven't really felt the drive to go talk to women. It's been 4 years.
Sometimes I fantasize about meeting some clingy gal from here or crystal cafe and "fixing them" but that never lasts more than a moment.
--- 72979615
>>72979285
haha, masturbation and self loathing is a common denominator among people here. you seem to be well-worded and capable of keeping your 'part' of the discussion. that itself is something to appreciate.

alright, i'm going to stop with these topics so it won't slide in to a bitter trauma dumping.

so, what are your responses if i ask you the same questions as you did in op?

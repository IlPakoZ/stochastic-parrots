>the average robot's life experience is something women like this will never understand or even know exists

Isn't it insane how the genetic lottery creates such enormous gulfs in the human experience? Why wouldn't we be looking forward to VR and sexbots when life is so unfair to many? The girl in the webm will never know hardship or struggle. She will always have people tripping over one another to help her and buy her things and take care of her every need.

>women like this
Women in general you mean. Women live life on tutorial mode. It's been said many times and yet it's never been rebutted. It's why fembots categorically do not exist.

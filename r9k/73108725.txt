I don't deserve such luxury. Even working as a cash register in the first world makes you a king compared to the third world. What did I do to deserve this life? And yet here I am wasting it away in front of my PC all day. I'm a useless NEET, but I feel guilty for taking a job because I know deep down I don't truly deserve to make a living. There are kids in Africa far more disciplined and far more talented and far more hard-working than I'll ever be but I'll thrive in life simply because I was born in a better place. It disgusts me.

False. No one in Africa has talent. You are delusional.

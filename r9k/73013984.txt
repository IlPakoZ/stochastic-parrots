I decided in university to completely keep to myself until graduation. I did this intentionally to not entangle my interpersonal relationships with people at school or their broader community

I didnt go to univeristy or anything like that. I just dont like people enough to want to tolerate a schooling environment. But some of my friends went and made friends while they were there at least in the first year but all those guys dropped out I heard and they dont talk much anymore at all.

i'm guessing you had some serious goals. how did that work out? did you ever get cold approached by wormpeople?

I literally just talked to my flatmates, I would only consider two friends and the rest people I'm friendly with. What i've learned as an young adult is that not every relationship is going to be deep and personal, some people you just have to get along with.

I finally got a bf in university, but in 3 years I still haven't made friends. people seem to enjoy my company if I'm paired with them during lectures for example, but still no friends. I kinda feel like I've skipped the whole "university experience" though, never been to a club among other things that other people have done.

No. I didn't speak to anyone for 3 years, then dropped out because I realized I was wasting my time since I can live on 300 euro a month and I have no need for a career or a job.

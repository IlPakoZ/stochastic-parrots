I feel like I have a monkey paw superpower.

Some nights, it feels like every thread I touch dies.
--- 72988185
Yeah, that's happened a lot of times to me. It's sad because there couldve been a lot of cool discussion on the thread, but it had to die for some shitty bait thread

Stop making crap replies to threads that you want to be alive, it seems.

If only it worked like that, but effortposting often goes unnoticed while shitposts go on forever.

Hypocrite, for you replied to my post and kept it alive, therefore proving my point.

>>72988819
It's the exception that confirms the rule or some shit, I don't care.
--- 72989996
If you posted something that made too much sense and no one in the thread could contest it or shout buzzwords without seeming mad then yeah that happens a lot here

Thank you for your concession.

You won an argument bro, I bet you feel amazing right now.
--- 72990312
>>72989996
That's a good point, effortposting can actually end a thread.
--- 72990351
>>72990300
Yes, but not because I won. In this moment, I am ecstatic because I am bumping a non-bait thread.

Fair. Although it's not a very good non-bait thread imo.

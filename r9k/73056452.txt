23yo male. I don't care about just 
>muh sex. 
I want love. Or at least I wanted, I've been getting progressively more and more hopeless and I think giving up is the only option for such a trash tier loser.
I'm just. Idk for what exact reason. Disgusting. Repelling. Revolting.
Not one woman has ever thought of me as a potential partner, let alone a desirable option. A recluse, a failure, completely rejected and locked out of social circles throughout my teen years, schools, etc. Same nowadays in college, but I cope well and my career prospects are ok-ish. I've never seen any woman look at me. Maybe with contempt. Interactions were always very unpleasant, women just can't help but show disgust at my sight and existence. Any crush I had was not even aware of my existence. Very unlikely I'll ever experience love. 
>muh creep
I really am not. I always see incel this incel that, I have never behaved in such a manner. Just a locked-out-of-romance loser.

Do you see yourself as genuinely ugly? Or is it more about not being "hot" + having autism?

22m, same. I said it in another thread but my looksmatch is obese and socially awkward. Her bf height mogs me. I've accepted that I'm not meant for this world but it still doesn't make me feel any better.

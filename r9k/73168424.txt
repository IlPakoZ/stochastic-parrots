Why does society pressure people to have lots of friends and being in a relationship? I love being lonely. I've had my fair share of sex and friends but I like the seclusion. Less drama and bullshit. I broke it off with a lot of people whom I thought were friends
>MAYBE YOU WERE THE UNLIKEABLE PERSON
Maybe, but I don't care. I just hate being valued as a person because I don't have massive social circles or getting pussy. Like what the fuck?

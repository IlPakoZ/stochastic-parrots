You should try giving them sandwiches more often.

 You are telling me they'd rather have one of their workers labeled as 'mentally unstable' rather than just fire him straight away?

She's probably just laying the groundwork to fire him. How women treat you is mostly based on how attractive they find you, they have a hard time seeing value outside of that

>believing what HR says.
Never do anything than be professional and distant at work.
Always have a paper trail of the favoritism and unfair treatment. Come up with some sort of bullshit or pretend to be minority religion and file a lawsuit to get unemployment and/or a severance package. Nothing will make a companies head spin when you file a federal lawsuit with documentation, then when you come to the table and only want a very modest 6 months salary and will sign a NDA they will fast track it. Costs 400-600 dollars to file in federal court and there are cookie cutter standard complaint forms you can get. 

A few disclaimers, first of all you can't have done anything turbo-autistic and/or made threats of violence on the way out or been accused of sexual harassments and the woman has texts and shit from you trying to flirt. 

Only other thing is if you are dealing with a small company and the owner and/or his family are a narcissists you will be dealing with someone who will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars just to win so this tactic won't work. Ofc you can always drop the case.

Does anyone actually believe this?

>>73087533
Yeah actually it's pretty believable especially in places with a lot of bullshit work politics. This is an incredibly common tactic to push people out, basically called "giving them a chance to resign" and save face/their resume as opposed to making them look bad and outright firing them. Well that's how it was for your parents' generation. Nowadays it's just to check the box for some legal proceeding (threat assessment) since everyone is so afraid of mass shootings. 
I should also mention sudden about-faces like OP's are a known threat marker for someone about to go postal, so OP would do well to lawyer the fuck up.

Maybe I'm too lowly to be considered for such tactics but I've never had to deal with HR within 10 years at my job (government).

There's no such thing as "too low" for mobbing. If someone wants you gone bad enough, they'll make you gone, simple as. Government work, with some extreme exceptions, are not as backstabby as private industry which rewards this behavior.

>>73087557
More reasons you should be worried is that gun violence fears have been hyped up over the last few months, and we're in the middle of the part of the year when mass shootings tend to happen. Hell, we just passed a week of several major anniversaries and we still have the supreme mentlegen spergout's day next month, so gl faggot.

Why tf you listening to HR? 
They're miserable and will make you more miserable. 

Good effort tho. I, at least, think so. 
Nice job, anon.

>>73087635
HR is there to protect the company, perhaps the executives. That's it. They don't give a single fuck about you, that girl who supposedly got harassed, etc. They just want to make the problem go away before it makes the corp look bad. HR isn't on your side. Get it through your thick fucking skulls.

That describes the vast majority of small-medium size businesses in the US.

Aside from maybe 3 people I get along well with everyone and am a capable worker so I've never had to deal with it

 That sounds even worse, like they expect you to turn Bateman anytime soon instead of a certainty that you are already one.

This is a larp, HR wouldn't tell you "be more energetic" your boss would, and HR wouldn't use a term like "mentally unstable".

By small company, I mean SMALL, they usually don't even have a HR department and our not publicly or privately invested in anyway. Think construction subcontractor type small. If the company has a fairly big HR department and is on the hook to a bank owning shares or a part of the company they are vulnerable to the people keeping the cashflow positive wanting shit to go away asap.

Jesus fucking Christ why do people need to make literally fucking everything so needlessly complicated. I am gonna start trying to get back into IT again. Never trust a company that talks so much about family bros.

You've never had a real job in your life
Might as well have wrote "HR gives report my result is 'suspected of faggotry'" for how believable that is

I'm supposed to be out here doordashing but instead I'm sitting in a Food Lion parking lot too scared to go into any restaurant. I'm too scared to be seen by other people. What mental illness is this?

I just hate being seen as make, the pariah slave class of society
Hearing someone refer to me as such ( pronouns, etc) makes me sick, akin to calling a black person a nigger slave, like they are trying to compel me into physical servitude subconsciously 
Is this schizo?

garden variety social anxiety bro
congrats on being boring

why are you worried about being seen? everyone is grotesque and ugly. even attractive people.
do you think a naked molerat thinks about how ugly other naked molerats are? even the most attractive naked mole rat is ugly to us.
look at steve buscemi, dudes made an entire career about being ugly. who fucking cares.
even stacy is going to look like an ugly worn out grandma in 30 years.

just go into the damn grocery store
buy the shit
drive it to the damn customer and LARP like you're grocery boy. Who fucking cares? They don't. they just want their groceries and are too lazy to get it themselves. just make your money so you can eat.

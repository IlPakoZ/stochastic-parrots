Honestly, the main reason I want to get my shit together at this point is because I'm bored. I don't enjoy vidya anymore and haven't for years, I don't enjoy junk food, I don't even like sexting with girls that much anymore even though 16 y/o me would've gone crazy for it. I need to meet girls irl and get a gf, I need to get a job, I need my own place, I want irl friends, I want my own car. I'm sick of living like a perpetual 16 y/o, it's pathetic, and I've had more than my fill after 10+ years of this lifestyle.

Same bro I'm 24 now albeit I work alot and drive I'm tired of living at my moms place. If I had my own place I could at least get drunk without anyone having to see me. Money's tight tho everytime I bust my ass for a decent paycheck it never feels like much.

Yeah I feel that, I would have moved out years ago if min wage paid more. We'll move out soon enough I guess.

I'm content with drinking and reading when I get home. I don't even hate my job anymore. I feel very calm and tranquil about everything. I have heard this is usually what people are like a few weeks before they kill themselves. I hope it's true.

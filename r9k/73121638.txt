Yeah but you have to time them right 
Friday or Sunday nights are good times I think 
And just bump it and start conversations with people yknow

Im looking forward to the weekend even though I dont do that much differently
Just slightly less working on things and more unashamed Me Time 
How about you lads

Comfy threads are the best. I had a pretty relaxing Friday, mostly driving around. It's finally been warm and sunny enough for the lawn to dry out. It felt good to mow it and make things look a bit tidier

Mostly stressed out, in a dead end job with not much hope for the future. At least i still have a somewhat amount of free time, but i motly waste it doing nothing or watching random shit on youtube.

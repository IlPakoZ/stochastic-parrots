Anyone else find it weird that 4chan is full of social conservatives now?

No because I was here when the initial stormfront raids that changed the culture of the site started. That was a long time ago though, and the far-right is a lesser evil compared to the liberal status quo

no because r9k was a board always for incels by incels and women hatred is not political, it is natural and good. disgusting turdwhore retards.

Actually this boards original purpose was gentlemenposting and we should return to that
--- 73061376
>>73061373
nope it was to have women hate threads and call out simp retard turdwhore morons like you. simple as. no discussion.

The ignominy is palpable

>stormfront raids
this will never stop being funny. An out right fabrication. The fact is the site was very organically beginning to lean right anyway and stormfront was incapable of affecting any lasting chance, or even acute change, even had they wanted to.

Anon has stared into the abyss long enough to decide he doesn't like what he hath seen, both within it and himself. It doesn't help that clown world's degeneracies have eclipsed that of most anons; such horrors have been made public, framed as exemplary behavior, and promoted to children.

To be honest image boards at the time of 4chans creation were all full of edgelords and were considered right wing spaces. Not much has changed in image board culture, the wider internet has gotten bigger and with that more people with neo lib filled the new media sites

Now? They started coming here during the election (you know the one)

>>73061410
Like this guy said, being an edgelord is the most popular passtime on this site and back in 2016 there was a very funny type of edgelording that was and still is easy to get yous from. I used to spout orange man rhetoric just to get a rise out of people

Utter nonsense dreamed up by a Klansman. If you think for half a second this hentai shithole had political "leanings" you live inside your own head canon.

Stormfront may not have converted many people, but they opened the floodgate for their kind to come here and shit up the place, driving out the users that want nothing to do with their yeehaw-style white supremacy.

Correct. If anything 2000s 4chan was like "seekrit clubhouse" vibes (at the risk of sounding like a faggot). We posted 50 hitlers and swastikas regularly, but this was because we thought it was funny. There was no political consciousness
--- 73061619
it's just that what's considered left &amp; right has changed
>>73061410
you could be leftwing and use slurs before, now you can't
>>73061459
and the election really split people, made em pick sides

4chan was very much, if anything, generally, left of center before, and back when the right wingers wanted to ban violent video games to save the children, remember
now that kind of thing has sort of slipped, now we would attribute the leftwing wanting to ban such things, but it's also changed from say, 'violent' to 'sexist'

above all this 4chan has also been full of a contrarian people, and so when the *vibes* took a hard swing left and they became more extreme we had to meet them, which fanned their flames which fanned our flames and so on

I've been here since 2007, and not quite. the low level of moderation and anonymity here basically guaranteed problems. 4chan's always been shittier than most places at ousting Nazis, and there's a lot of people here who are very isolated and have mental health issues. The rot just got worse year by year.

I've browsed this shithole almost daily since the Chanology days and I've only gotten more leftwing. It's sad that both sides get lured away from real issues through culture war garbage, but at this point I think the environmental and demographic collapse is inevitable.

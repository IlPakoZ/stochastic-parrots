How can I as a 24-year-old virgin expect to compete against younger and more hung guys who have already performed victory laps around my nonexistent sexual experience before they have even graduated high school?

sex is overrated

I wasted my good looks and potential during my formative teen years smoking weed, jerking off and being a coward in general so I guess I'm paying the price. I could definitely get laid now especially since I started going to the gym over a year ago but I have no opportunities to meet females after college. You really need to be in a fish bowl type environment like school or a lucky job where you see the same girls on a daily basis. 
... I guess for now I'll just have coping sessions with my fist as I jerk off to the awesome sex lives of others.

I don't. I am drowning in despair, and burning in jealousy. 
I hate not being good enough.

this is what pornsickness looks like. no woman wants to date a coomer who creates these types of threads. surely you can see what you look like to outside eyes? why would a woman ever want to date a male who spends his free time posting this?

You have a point but it's not like they can tell on the outside. It's hard to stop fapping even when I do NoFap streaks.

We can, but most are too focused on the idea of it not happening for other reasons, so that outside view of yours is nothing in comparison to their delusions. 
When you focus too much on something, you don't register what's around you. Even if you do see it

I could probably fuck a girl like that but I have never had sex.

Find a way to feel superior to them. Nobody can have all the basis covered (except me but I'm special). Find the thing you exceed the most at and becomes so immensely skilled at it that you no longer compare yourself to other people.
I see men with women nowadays, and it bothers me, but I know deep down that the guy's they're with are very likely just fucking pussies who probably only know how to function in the specific job-field they have and whatever things they cemented in their developmental years
Normalshits are shit, women are shit

Become self-actualizing and compare yourself only to yourself anon, that's the easiest way to surpass the issue that you have with this

>no woman wants to date a coomer who creates these types of threads
Don't be a fucking idiot anon, be realistic. 
Most women don't want to date 85% of the different types of men that exist. 
If a guy is coming to this website, then he already very likely is in the camp that women would consider occluded from interacting with romantically or otherwise.

It's way easier to tell then you think.
Just a little chat and you end up exposed, you might think these things aren't easy to notice and don't come up, but they do.
Honestly stop, you are just hurting yourself for no reason and falling deeper into your own delusions.

it's not hard to not watch porn obsessively to the point where you create threads like this? who mentioned nofap? as if you think masturbating = porn? truly a sign of porn and internet addiction

>>72996947
massive cope to not change anything in your life. "i can't get a gf so my only solution is to be pornsick :(" can you hear yourself?

>>72996962
most men are able to form relationships and can interact with women in real life. muh 85% is an incel/pornsick cope. can you not just accept that most men aren't as dependent on the internet and hardcore porn as you are?

Chad here about to hit the gym after sending this. I have a girlfriend. I only come to this board sometimes for entertainment. You guys aren't wrong, but it's some quality schadenfreude.

Maybe I was a bit hard. Don't end up like me anon, I'm 32 and still live with my parents because I wasted my teens and 20s being scared of girls rejecting me, doing hard drugs and spending all my money. I had multiple relapses where I would drain all my money, which would be around 20k-30k from my bank account and leave myself with nothing, then start all over again. I should have like 100k in the bank and be buying a house but I have less than 20k and pay my Dad rent. Imagine how embarrassing it would be if I ever did end up on a date and she did want to fuck but I have to tell her we have to go to her place because I still live with my parents, I'm already dying inside at the thought.

You can still get out of that hole honestly if you really try. Get a job and make friends, if its only guys who cares they probably have friends who also have friends, network my boy. Go to the mall or some place a lot of people hang out and just start trying to chat up strangers, I don't want to hear this is too hard or embarrassing because if you cant say hello to a stranger then it really is over. Now is not the time to be meek anon if you get complacent with it now you're gunna be in the same spot when you're 30. This is for your own good anon you need to leave your comfort zone in order to get a girl.

You are supposed to have a gym routine and have your whey protein shake every morning

Then you have to create intimacy with the girl.

When that happens, when you have long term intimacy and regular weightlifting and nutrition and your protein shakes you can cum in the first minute or two and rest for 1-3 minutes, it's possible you don't even need to rest, and you can not only do it like that but also do it 10 times in a row.

It's similar to this.

You can do that especially second time because you get less sensitive.
The girl that taught me said first time is for him and second time for her. But with intimacy and desire it's possible to go beyond two times.

I also was nearing 30 and I had the same insecurities you had.
You need to be with the person, live, that being just you and her and the intimacy changed everythingnand you will just feel intense desire like you never felt before, just by being you and her in the same room, alone and with the same intentions

Now that I read the thread I think you message was about getting a girlfriend to begin with, sorry. But I will still send it because you and others might find interesting.

>massive cope to not change anything in your life. "i can't get a gf so my only solution is to be pornsick :(" can you hear yourself?
I was only referring to myself in part.
I have done things to change, maybe not the right ones. 
I am naive and often fail.
Idk what to do. But ik it's my responsibility. I have no clue on what to do about these feelings tho, ignoring them has gotten me nowhere.

Also, I don't know if I'm pornsick, maybe I am. I'm willing to give it up tho.

Don't worry anon, most men IRL can't increase video speed to 1.25x during sex, you'll be fine
